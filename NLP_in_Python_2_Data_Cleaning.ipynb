With his signature deadpan delivery, Bargatze riffs on relatable topics like pizza-ordering dilemmas, domestic quirks with his frugal wife, and parenting mishaps, weaving personal anecdotes with exaggerated humor. The show opens with a spirited introduction from his daughter, setting the stage for a performance rooted in self-deprecating humor, small-town nostalgia, and sharp observations about modern absurdities. Bargatze’s storytelling shines as he recounts his days as a water meter reader, his failed attempts to manage daily routines without his wife’s guidance, and his humorous take on aging and familial dynamics.', 'The special thrives on Bargatze’s ability to find comedy in the mundane, whether it’s debating the dominance of dogs sleeping in beds or lamenting the complexities of fast-food drive-throughs. His observations on generational quirks, from his parents’ idiosyncrasies to his own aging mishaps, resonate universally. The show crescendos with his musings on societal advancements, juxtaposed with his small-town upbringing, culminating in laugh-out-loud reflections on AI, modern hotels, and outdated services like wake-up calls. Through it all, Bargatze maintains a warm and engaging rapport with his audience, delivering a feel-good hour of humor that blends sharp wit with heartfelt relatability.', '* * *', '[crowd cheering]', '[“Sunday Best” by Surfaces playing]', 'Please welcome my daddy, Nate Bargatze!', '♪ Feeling good, like I should ♪', '[crowd cheering]', '♪ Went and took a walk Around the neighborhood ♪ ♪ Feeling blessed, never stressed ♪ ♪ Got that sunshine On my Sunday best, yeah… ♪ I love you. ♪ Every day can be a better day Despite the challenge ♪ ♪ All you gotta do is leave it Better than you found it ♪ ♪ It’s gonna get difficult to stand But hold your balance ♪ ♪ I just say whatever ‘Cause there is no way around it ♪', 'Thank you. Thank you.', '[crowd cheering]', 'Phoenix, thank you so much. That was so good.', '[crowd continues cheering]', '[Nate] Thanks. Thank you.', '[cheering continues]', 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That’s very nice.', '[crowd whooping]', 'This is it. We’re doing it. Uh… So… My… I love… Look, I love doing stand-up comedy. I love it. And the job I had, the last serious job, the job I will go back to when all this falls apart…', '[crowd laughing]', 'I was a water meter reader.', '[scattered cheering]', 'Thank you. This job was… The title was the description of what you do.', '[crowd laughing]', 'People would ask, I’d go, “I’m a water meter reader.” “Yeah, what’s that?” Let me tell you what it is, all right? We’re going to read water meters. That’s the… That’s 100% of the job. So back when I did it, it was in Wilson County, Mt. Juliet, Tennessee. And so, back when I did it, I would have to park the truck, and like get out in the neighborhood. Like, run through a neighborhood, and type in how much water every house uses. So it’s 2001. Obviously, 9/11 happens. If you’re old enough, you remember when 9/11 happened, the whole country got very scared there was going to be more attacks. Well, we did as well in Wilson County. We figured, they just went to New York, obvious next stop, Mt. Juliet, Tennessee.', '[crowd laughing]', 'And they are going to poison our town’s water. So they got all of us water meter readers to guard the water tanks. I really did this. I stood… just in a dark field, alone, waiting for the Taliban to show up. No weapons, no training. They gave us a lantern. A lantern! That does nothing but shows your body as you hold it up. I can’t see two feet in front of me. If someone’s got a gun, they’re like, “Shoot at the only light in that field.” I’m going to put it over my heart to see. I’m like, “What’s going on?” I mean, I think, like, to this day, I’ve always said, what did they want us to do? Call the Mt. Juliet Police? “Osama is here.” “He got past our lanterns.” “He’s in the water tank. He knew how to open that. We were…” “We were surprised by that, but he knew what he was doing.” My wife was with me when I had that job. She’s been with me way before where we’re at right now. She was in it for the benefits I got at the water company. Uh… [Nate chuckles] We have, uh… So we’ve been married 17 years.', '[crowd cheering]', 'Thank you. And, uh, I know… You know, the longer I’m married, the more I realize why she was put in my life. I would not be here if she was not in my life. I know all of this. Now, I’ve also become very reliant on her because of this. I don’t know anything about me. Like… I don’t know what I like and don’t like to eat.', '[crowd laughing]', 'I mean, someone would be like, “You want to try this?” And I got to get her involved. I’m like, “I don’t think so.” I don’t know how long to microwave something. I have to ask her every time, as if her family invented the microwave. “How long do we microwave this for?” And she’s like, “Do it till it’s hot.” It’s like, “But I know you know a number. You know, just…” “Just say the number. I don’t…” “I’m either gonna call my mom, or you’re gonna tell me the number.” If she doesn’t tell me, I type in 90 minutes and I walk away. [Nate laughs] I do do my own laundry.', '[crowd cheering]', 'Thanks. Thank you. I think that’s what it deserves. My mom did my dad’s laundry growing up, so I thought all wives do husbands’ laundry. And I’ve always done my own, and to be honest, I felt it had been forgotten about over these past 17 years. The sacrifice I was making that other husbands didn’t have to make. One day, I was driving home and it popped in my head, and I was like, “All right, I’ll bring that up.” I mean, I didn’t bring it up that day, you know? I was like, I’m sure there will be a time where we’ll be in some fight, I’ll be losing this fight… and then, I mean, I just come, I’m like, “I do my own laundry!” She’s like, “Fight’s over!” “You win. I forgot how good I got it.” So I sit on it for, like, six months, like a long… [laughs] We finally get in a fight. I don’t remember what the fight was about. Nothing. I don’t know. It wasn’t laundry. I remember that. So, I’m losing this fight. And so, in my head I’m like, “This is it.” I mean, honestly, I was sad to see it go. That’s how good I felt. I felt bad for her. I mean… I was like, “She thinks she’s winning this fight.” “I’m about to drop a bomb on her right now.”', '[crowd laughing]', 'So just out of nowhere, I just go, “I do my own laundry!” And I said it like, “They don’t make them like this no more.” I was shocked that it started a second fight I never saw coming.', '[crowd laughing, applauding]', '[Nate laughs] Thanks. We do laundry very differently. She’ll read the labels, I’ll wash a rug and a suit together. I’m… I don’t know. “You wanna put your shoes in there? Put your shoes.” The washing machine’s always a foot from the wall when I get done. [chuckles] It’s like, “That was a lot of stuff you put in there.” You know? Yeah. “And look, it’s almost all wet.” I travel a lot. Obviously. So she’ll be at home with our daughter. We have a wonderful daughter, as you have seen.', 'And…', '[crowd cheering]', 'But I know it’s hard. You know, she’s home, my wife has to be the mom and the dad, and the good and the bad parent. You know, and I come home and I’m super fun. Or I’ll mess up the routine. This is just stuff she tells me. And…', '[crowd laughing]', 'Like, I’ll go… When I go home, I’ll lay in bed with our daughter and then we get in trouble for talking. I’m not the one talking, by the way. But we get yelled at as if I’m the one talking. I do get it, because I don’t think of the consequences with everything. Like, we have one dog. I would like another dog. My wife does not want another dog, because it’s a lot. It’s a lot to have two dogs, ’cause you got to open the back door and let two dogs out.', '[crowd laughing]', 'Then you shut it, and now… now they’re out there. You’re inside, not dealing with it, but… But then they want to come back in and you’re like, [grumpily] “Got to go let all these dogs back in.” You’re like, “One dog, two… Look at all these dogs everywhere.” Look, I… To be honest, I’ve never taken care of the one dog we have, but… Two? Two would be fun. Our dog sleeps in our bed, and someone told me you’re not supposed to do that, ’cause you lose dominance over the dog. And, you know, I asked him, I said, “What year do you think it is?” These are all doodles. They’re barely dogs. It’s a person. They’re people. This guy acts like it’s 1980 when you kept the dog outside all year. Those, you needed dominance over. You had a wolf in the backyard. Friends come over. “You want to go outside?” “I wouldn’t.” She’s the cheaper one of us, as well. Not in a bad way, you know. She likes the lights being off. Turn the lights off, you know, save money. Turn the… Get the lights. All the lights off, it’s a fun time, being in that environment. Turn the light on, find your seat. Get a stick, knock the light back off. Sit in the dark and be sad and just be… just sad all day. But you’re saving nickels upon nickels. Right when I get in bed, “You turn that light off?” “I can’t tell if that’s on.” “Well, get out of bed, turn it off.” Eighty years, we’ll give our daughter the $37 from all the nickels we saved. All right, look, I can be wasteful. Like, if something gets to the bottom, I will throw it away. Ketchup. If ketchup gets, like, that much left, I’m like, “Bleh.” She will put the old ketchup with the new ketchup. That way your ketchup’s always gross.', '[crowd laughing]', \"Toothpaste. I will use it to what I think the average person uses it to. I don’t think I should feel muscles trying to get it out. I’m not going to have an iron on top of it. But she’ll do it more. So I know when I’m done with it, I give it to the hobo I married. She cuts it, gets it all out. I married an old man from the Depression, is who I married. She would have thrived during the Depression. I don’t think she would’ve known there was a Depression. A pizza party is my nightmare. I’ll have friends over for pizza. So I’ll be like, “All right, we gotta order pizza.” And she goes, “How much?” I go, “Order the most.” “I don’t want to run out of pizza in front of my friends.” She goes, “Just call and ask them.” I go, “I can’t call these 40-year-old dudes and just be like, ‘How much pizza do you think you’re gonna eat tonight?'” They have a real… They have a family. They work in a building, right now. You want me to call and be like, “You have a big lunch today?” “No, we’re trying to save money, so I need to know exactly how much pizza you’re going to eat in eight hours.”\", 'I just want to buy stuff and her not know I bought it, and… that’s so hard. I think if I knew the name of my bank, I could do it. But I got to go through her to get that information. I poke around, I’ll be like, “If I had a bank, what bank do you think I would go to?” I also, once a week, walk into a bank and go, “Hello, is my money in this bank?” She has to get me out of stuff all the time. If I buy something and it doesn’t fit, I’ll never take it back. I’m embarrassed. I’m pretty sure it’s going to be the exact same people. And they remember me. And right when I walk in, they’ll be like, “We knew you couldn’t handle that shirt.” She takes back groceries to the grocery store. [incredulously] Yeah. Food. I… Honestly, I don’t think it’s allowed. I… Honest. I think she’s bullying these 15-year-old children. They don’t know what to do. Their mom walks in being like, “Your bananas got weird too quick.” And they’re like, “What?” “You picked them out. They’re not mine. What are you talking about?” “I’m gonna change them. I’mma go change them out.” “Yeah, that lady is stealing bananas.” Recently, I was walking to my car and I had a college kid come up and he was raising money, uh… You know, for nature. Or it was for Earth. It was nature and Earth. Uh… I don’t know. He used real words. But it was, you know, basically… I felt he even looked at me, like, “It’s going to Earth.” I was like, “Yeah. Well, Earth is going through it right now.” So… He was telling me everything Earth is going through. You know, it’s pollution. He said, “Our water’s being poisoned.” You know, I said, “Not under my watch, but I understand.”', '[crowd laughing, cheering]', 'I think I was buying a tree, I don’t really know. But I tried to give him cash and he was like, “Oh, you got to do a credit card.” I was like, “Okay.” So, I give a random iPad all my family information. It was $75. So he, like, swipes the card, and then after it goes through, he goes, “Just so you know, it’s a monthly charge.”', '[crowd gasps]', 'Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah. He told me after. And he was like, “Look, you can cancel it on the website.” I was like, “I don’t know what’s going on right now.” He goes, “Put your email down for the receipt.” I was like, “All right.” I just put my wife’s email address down. Guess who’s going to put a stop to this real fast?', '[crowd laughing, cheering]', 'She’ll have that tree cut down tomorrow. I called her, ’cause I have to call her when I sign us up for stuff, and… [chuckles] She answered the phone, just goes, “I’m on it.” Hung up. She runs everything. She does stuff, doesn’t tell me. We got a new roof, and I did not know that. A whole new roof, I found out from my neighbors. They were like, “How’s that new roof going?” I go, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” And they go, “You didn’t know you got a new roof?” I go, “No, I did not.” And then I had to go get her, I was like, “You gotta go talk about that new roof you didn’t tell me about.” “I looked like an idiot out there.”', 'We live… So, in our neighborhood, we live in a cul-de-sac, which is very exciting, because I grew up on a straight street… and I always dreamed of living in a cul-de-sac. You see them and you’re like, “Can you imagine being up in one of those?” We do all the cul-de-sac stuff, you know. Like, if anybody comes down there, we’re like, “What are you doing down…” Just, any car. We’re like, “You better get out of our cul-de-sac.”', 'We take our trash out, uh… one of the days. I don’t know the day, but it’s a day. We’re doing it. There is one day. I know we forgot to take it out a couple weeks ago. That stress could break up a family. All week was like, “Everybody, eat out of your hands.” We had friends over, “Put your trash in your pockets, take it to your homes.” We got very lucky with our neighbors. Our neighbors are super cool, and we’re very close with them. Uh, they all have real jobs. They, like, went to college and stuff. And… one of them is a management consultant, so he manages all the consultants and… Yeah, it’s a tough job. All right? There’s a lot of consultants and he’s like, “You better get back.” You know? “You can’t…” “Just can’t consult up in here.” So, he’s busy. Our other neighbor’s an actuary. I thought that was with birds. I was like, “What’s that bird right there?” He goes, “I don’t know.” And I was like…', '[crowd laughing, cheering]', '“As an actuary, you don’t know what that bird is right there?” I went to career day for my daughter’s school, and, like, I get what I do is very fun, but I was nervous, ’cause I’m there with real people and they’re smart, and… So I was hoping to sit at a table alone. They put me at a table with a surgeon. Which I… I think they did it on purpose. Almost to show the kids, “Here’s the difference between reading.”', '[crowd laughing, cheering]', 'So the kids, like, come up, you know, and they’re like, “What subjects do you use for comedy?” And I was like, I don’t even know what subjects they’re taking. Uh… I was like, “I do English. I do mostly English onstage.” They asked him, “How long do you go to school to be a surgeon?” You know, and he’s like, “54 years,” or whatever. It’s like… They asked me, they’re like, “How long to be a comedian?” I was like, “You’re good now.” So… “Look, finish elementary school, make your parents happy, but then I’d get out and get after it.” I had a hard time in school. There was… I got… I barely graduated, got into a community college, barely got into a college they have to let everybody in. I went to community college for one year, I have zero credits. Community college, a lot of people don’t know, is college when they’re like, “You’re probably going to stay in your community. So…” “We’re just going to show you the ropes around town.” “Kind of give you a lay of the land.” That whole year, I don’t have credits, because I had to take remedial classes. Which remedial is basically for… They’re classes for someone my age now trying to go back to school because they don’t remember school. And I took them right out of school. I just… They’re like, “You don’t remember school?” I was like, “I just came from school.” They go, “It looks like you’ve never heard about it.” Everybody in there was, like, 50. I’m like, “Well, who’s the teacher?” “I think you have to tell me if I ask. Who’s the teacher?”', 'I took such basic… I took Speech. In college. I’d go… I would ride there with my friends, going to a business class or something. Whatever you go to. I was like, “All right, I’ll catch you after Speech.” And I still say a lot of words wrong, that’s what I don’t understand. I say, uh, “Poim.” “Poim.” Which no one ever knows. Uh, poem. Like… Yeah. P-O-E-M. I go, “poim.” Well, fix that, Speech class. What if I want to be a “poim” writer? What if I have a lot of great “poim” ideas? And no one takes me serious, ’cause I’m like, “Listen to my poims.” “Ol.” I say, “Ol.” A super Southern one. Uh… Oil. I don’t even know how to say it. Like, to y’all. Oil. O-I-L. Yeah. Yes. [laughs] I go, “Motor ol.” Like, “Tinfol.” I mean, Southern community college, that should be mandatory that they fix that. They should write O-I-L on the board, and I just go, “Ol.” They go, “We’re gonna take care of that. All right?” “There’s a pretty good chance you’re gonna be working with a lot of that.” “Silver War.” That’s how I say it. Instead of “Civil.” I go, “Silver War.” Because… You know? Look, that might be on me. All right? I’m not… I’ll tell you, I don’t even know anything about the “Silver War.” I don’t know anything about history. And I can tell, because every history movie I watch, I watch on the edge of my seat.', '[laughing, applause]', '“What is gonna happen?” I watched Pearl Harbor. I was just as surprised as they were, you know? I don’t read. Yeah, and I think that matters. Reading is the key to smart, I believe. And… I don’t do it. I think it’s caught up to me. I want to do it. I like the idea of reading. I even buy books, but these books are the most words. And… It’s every book. You just open it and you’re like, “What are you talking about?” It… I mean… And they don’t let up. Every page, just more words. How about you put some blank pages in there? Why don’t you let me get my head above water for two seconds?', '[crowd laughing, applauding]', 'My eyes can read good. It’s my brain. My eyes are such good readers. I feel so bad, ’cause they’re attached to this dumb brain. I mean, they’re looking at these words, they’re like, “You’re not getting any of this, man?” “That’s the fifth time we’ve read that sentence. Let’s try another one.” Fiction, non-fiction. I don’t know which one’s the truth. I read every book as the truth is how I handle it. From what I can tell, we have a pretty big wizard problem in this country right now. We went to… Like, we went to Europe last year. And by the way, on the way to… We were flying from Nashville to London, and we go, uh… It was 4:42 p.m. Nashville time. So as a game, as a family, I said, “Let’s guess what time it is in London.” So I said 12:42 a.m. Our daughter said 1:42 a.m. My wife, her guess was 11. And that’s it. Yeah, she didn’t say the 42. And, I was like, “Just say the 42.” She goes, “You know what I mean.” I go, “I know, but just… show our daughter you know what a normal person would say.” That started a pretty big fight. If you go to Europe, just so you know, uh… it’s the most old. It’s very old. You think we’re old, and you get there and you’re like, “Good night.” Uh… “What have y’all been doing over here?” You just walk around, they’re like, “That building is from 8.” You’re like, “Good golly.”', 'Went to Australia as well. Australia’s very far away. I’m going to tell you, our Earth is bigger than I thought it was. We flew 16 hours, over 500 miles an hour. Barely made it. Barely. I think we went the wrong way, as well. I had jet lag there. I did not mind it, ’cause I woke up early. I woke up at 5:45 a.m., and I don’t ever wake up that early. So I was, like, first in line at the breakfast buffet. Here’s what I will tell you, when you get up at 5:45 a.m. noon is pretty far away. I mean, you will bet your life it’s noon, and it’s maybe 8:30. By 6:00 p.m., it’s like, “How are people out?” “Why won’t the sun go down?” That’s the next phase of my life, getting up early, you know? We’re starting. We get up at 9:15 a little bit. Yeah. You know. I’ve never seen my daughter go to school, but I’ve been close. I’m cold now too, that I’m old. Forty-five. I just get cold, I always have to bring a jacket. It could be 135 degrees outside and I will walk around with a jacket. And I see these young people, and I just think, “Where are your jackets?”', 'My body’s falling apart. My… My shoulder hurts, ’cause I stand onstage like this. It’s crazy. This was a huge mistake to get into this. If I had known that this would be a big problem, I would have probably tried to not make it a habit. My body can’t handle this. And I went to the doctor to try to fix it… I mean, they talked to me like I was an old car. He goes, “I wouldn’t put any more money into it, to be honest.” I pulled a muscle recently, I guess it was in my soul. I mean, it was dead middle of my body… I thought it was the front. Then I was like, “Well, my back hurts too.” You know? So… Well, what’s in the middle? What muscle is in the middle? I went hiking. I jumped off a rock. I mean, a foot high. When I landed, it felt what I would imagine being struck by lightning feels like. I felt it through my fingernails. Fifty-fifty if my zipper’s up or down anymore. It’s a true flip of the coin. I don’t know what’s happening. I’ve zipped up my whole life. And now, just head out, like, “All right, see you boys later.” Just head out. Take my pants off at home. They come off easy. I’m like, “Ah, that was four hours I was walking around like…” I think it’s ’cause I’m peeing so much longer. And I’m not used to this new old rhythm yet. ‘Cause in your 40s, there’s a lot of false stops. You learn pretty quick to be like, “Let’s hang back.” “Let’s let traffic thin out a little bit.” I watch young people come and go. I’m like, “Tell my family I’m okay.” Food is still… I still have a problem with food. I… I love processed food. I love it. I’m a farm-factory-table guy.', '[crowd laughing, cheering]', 'I want… I want the most hands involved in my food. It’s coming to an end. You can feel… I can feel it. I can’t do it anymore. It really hurts. I… You know, and I tell myself, like, “I’ve done it. I was…” Yeah, my jersey would be retired of eating fast food. I’ve done all the stuff. I’ve had Taco Bell and threw it away in my neighbor’s trash so my wife didn’t find out. I used so much ketchup once at a restaurant, that a stranger walked up to me and goes, “That’s a lot of ketchup.” Do you know how much ketchup you got to use? That guy doesn’t want to get involved, you know? But he sees it. I mean, his wife’s like, “Let it go.” He’s like, “I think I got to say something. I don’t…” “I don’t think he knows that we’re all… No one’s using that much ketchup.” I went to a McDonald’s drive-through and my window did not roll down. That’s the universe saying, “Give it a rest.” And I fought through it. It’s embarrassing, because they can tell, because I had to pull past… Because I got to open my door, so it’s going to hit the speaker. So I gotta drive by it. So the car behind me is like, “Are you leaving?” I’m like, “My window don’t roll down.” And I got to open the door. Now the speaker is by the gas tank. So I gotta yell my order out. Now that guy hears it. And then I look at McDonald’s screen, well, they got it all on the board, just let the neighborhood know what I’m ordering. And then I drove by the window, the drive-through window, and I got to go by it, ’cause I got to open my whole door. So I go by it, and I see them, they’re like, “Where are you going?” I was like, “Nowhere.” And I go by, and they see my whole body sitting in a chair. It’s crazy. If you’ve never done it, it’s the most vulnerable I ever felt in my life. Just… You’re just sitting there, and you’re like, “Hi.”', 'They see your feet. They see your feet. They just throw it at me like a bear, just throw it. Our family, we just eat a lot of fast food. Our family text thread, my dad texted, he was like, “I found a way to get a Big Mac cheaper.” And he said, “You can order a double cheeseburger and ask for Big Mac sauce.” So he goes, “It’s cheaper, and they get rid of that third bun, so it’s Atkins.” Uh… That’s how you do it. That third bun is the one you’re like, “I don’t know if I need the third bun.” My parents are getting older, they’re not super old, but they’re at the age where, you know, if they trip, they will fall to the ground. There’s just an age where it hap… I mean… Like, if I trip, my body hasn’t touched the ground in 40 years. But for them, it’s just, I don’t know. It’s like the upper is like, “We’re going.” And… the lower is like, “What?” And it’s just… Boom. And I mean, there’s no, like, “Whoa.” It’s just, they don’t even know what’s happening. They’re just looking at you and you’re like, “You’re not feeling any of this?” And they hit the ground so hard. It’s like they got thrown off a roof. Everybody hears it, they’re like, “What’s going on?” I’m like, “My parents are down!” “I got to get ’em up.” “My mom’s got a bruise that won’t go away for two years.” I just walk ahead of them now. I’m like a Sherpa. Just let them know the terrain that we’re about to hit. “Got a little carpet coming up.” “Got a little carpet. When we go outside, a little brighter than inside.” “Yeah, and cobblestone. You ain’t gonna make that. So…” “Lay down. Lay down on the carpet.” “I’m gonna back the car up in the building.”', 'We had my mom go pick up our daughter recently at a friend’s house, and I texted her the address, and she drove to the wrong house. She knocked on the door, another grandmother answered. Well, this is no good. This is like two dogs seeing each other through a fence. It’s gonna be hard to get them both back inside. So, my mom, she goes, “Is my granddaughter there?” And the other lady goes, “I have three grandsons.” No solution. Just two grandmothers. “You have… You have stuff? I have stuff too.” They talked for 30 minutes. It’s the wrong door! I had to go get my daughter, then find my mom. And wives are the ones that keep it together the longest in a relationship. If you see an old married couple, like, 80-year-old… They’re 80, the wife is just… She’s with it. And her husband’s like, “Where are we at right now?” Like, he… I mean, our brains fall off a cliff, dude. Like, they’re… The only reason he’s out is because she’s like, “You better get out and let people see you a little bit.” It’s like some zookeeper walking some old gorilla around. “Let the kids touch you.” Everybody’s trying to feed him. “Don’t feed him that.” “I think he wants it.” “He definitely wants it. He’s too dumb to know he can’t have it.” My dad goes to the hospital all the time. I mean, he… He has surgery eight times a year, probably. He loves it. He loves it. The doctor will go, “Look, you could just stretch.” And he goes, “Let’s just do the surgery.” He had surgery ’cause he was addicted to Afrin, the nose spray. Yeah. Look, I… I got addicted to Afrin as well. I would honestly tell you, if you don’t know what it is, I would tell you not to get involved. It’s one of the best things I’ve ever been part of. When I was on it too, my wife was furious. I had to try to hide it from her. She could hear it from three blocks away. Just one little puff, “What’s that?” “I ain’t gonna live like this!” “I ain’t work this hard not to do Afrin in my own home.” So my dad, they go to the doctor, him and my mom. And the doctor was like, “Do you use Afrin?” And my dad goes, “No.” And the doctor was like, “I can tell that you use it.” “I was just saying that.” So… He goes, “How long have you used it?” And my dad said, “Five years.” Which is a lie. And my mom, she’s like, “Well, tell the truth.” You know, she goes, “He’s used it for 45 years.” He used Afrin 45 years. Just for reference, if you don’t know, the back of the box suggests no more than three days. I mean, there’s not a medicine on Earth that tells you to give it a good 45-year run. I think about my parents a lot because, I mean, the world is getting very futuristic. And, like them, I’m from the 1900s. You got to watch out for the 1900s people. We’re old.', '[crowd cheering]', 'It’s so… I mean, my great-aunt Helen from the ’30s. She’s deaf. They didn’t know she was deaf back then. The doctors, they had no idea. They were baffled. That’s how… That’s how good doctors were back then. They just said… They looked at her as they smoked in her face. These were real doctors. They were like, “I don’t know.” “She’s rude. I’ll tell you that.” I mean, I think what I saw growing up… I mean, we would go watch… My dad’s a magician. So we would go watch my dad do magic at the Wilson County Fair. County fairs are great. If you never… They’re still going around. I don’t think the government knows about them, but… I mean, we ride these rides that were on the interstate an hour ago. So we would go watch my dad. So my dad would do magic. Right next to him, they had a donkey jumping off a high dive into a pool. So pretty hard to keep everybody’s attention. When my dad is like, “Is this your card?” And everybody’s like, “This donkey’s about to jump off this high dive.” That’s something you don’t think you wanna see, till it’s up there. And I use the word “jump” very loosely. These donkeys are falling off this high dive. But you can’t put that on the sign, you know? “You gonna watch a donkey fall off a high dive?” “No.” “Okay.” “What if he jumped?” “Well, at least he’s into it.”', 'So the donkey would go up this ramp, like, 40 feet in the air. And it would just stand there ’cause it doesn’t want to jump. It’s not in on this, so… But it gets stuck ’cause donkeys can’t walk backwards. Not positive if that is true, but I… I’ve never seen a donkey go backwards. I’ve never even really looked, but I honestly think, 45 years, I would have seen a couple donkeys go backwards. So the donkey stands there, and a dog, he sends a dog up the ramp, it barks at the donkey and the donkey jumps in the pool. And as someone that has seen this, I tell you, when that donkey hits the water, you’re like, “We should probably get out of here. Uh…” It’s not as fun as you thought it would be. I mean, this is going to sound dumb, but you’re really surprised you’re seeing what the sign said you would see. PETA got a hold of that. They shut it down. And that was one I think everybody was like, “Fair enough, we get that.” Another one PETA had to shut down, this was again, like, the 1980s. I was alive. You could fight an orangutan at a fair. They would have an orangutan just sitting in a boxing ring and guys would pay to fight it. And I say “guys,” because I just can’t imagine one woman ever fought this orangutan. I think you can put an orangutan in a room with a thousand women, and when they walked out, like, “Did anybody fight it?” “It never crossed our mind to fight it.”', '[crowd laughing]', '[crowd cheering]', 'Put three men in that room, two of those men will fight that orangutan. The other one would’ve started it, going, “I think y’all should fight that orangutan.” So, guys get in there and they’re like, “All right, we’ll go fight this orangutan.” And the orangutan would just knock everybody out. Because we don’t have the internet to look up, “How strong is an orangutan?” It’s all word-of-mouth back then. You had to meet a guy that just fought an orangutan. You’re like, “But the arms are skinny.” He’s like, “I know. That’s what made me get in there as well.”', '[crowd laughing, applauding]', 'So PETA put a stop to that also. Yeah. Look, whatever you want to say about PETA, they did some real work in the 1900s. There’s… The first… One of the first things they had to do, car manufacturers, before crash test dummies were invented, they would use a pig in a car wreck. So they sit a pig I guess upright. And this little pig… Pigs are smart. Pretty good day for this pig. It’s like, “You gonna let me drive a car?” Pretty fun, pretty fun day. He’s got his elbow out. “Are y’all kidding me right now? You gonna let me drive this car?” I don’t even know what that shows you. Pigs don’t have necks. That’s what I was around when I was growing up. I mean, I look at my daughter, and I have more in common with a Pilgrim. And Pilgrims believed in witches. Little side note, I would like to say, I think the witch phase was the toughest phase for women to have to go through. Not to get serious, but a lot of people say voting. I disagree. I think it’s witch, then voting. I think it’s witch, pretty big gap, then, you know, voting. You jaywalk back then, the whole town’s like, “There’s a witch.” You’re like, “Here we go. Here we go!” And I’ll give it to ’em, because they could’ve flown away, but none of them ever did. [chuckles] All right, sorry. That… Look. Just trying to get a witch joke in, it’s pretty complicated. There’s a lot of moving parts. You got to bring up Pilgrims somehow. I took a typing class in seventh grade. That’s how…', '[crowd applauding, whooping]', 'And I thought it was a waste of my time. I… In my head, I was like, “Who’s going to be typing?” “Cursive is the future.”', '[crowd laughing, applauding]', 'That’s why I… ‘Cause the future… I don’t know what’s going… I don’t know technology. I don’t know what AI is. I don’t think you get to know what AI is and also see a donkey jump off a high dive. I think it was one or the other, and I saw the donkey, so I’m out. If I send an email and it says the file is too big, I don’t know what to do. My best guess is… I try to resend it. That’s what I try to… You know how dumb that is? The computer’s like, “No.” And I go, “What about now, though?” Hotels are getting futuristic. A lot of hotels, when I stay at, now, when you take a shower, they have half a glass. So, it’s open. So the water gets on the floor. Because that’s the future. They want water on the floor. And I’m old and dumb, I come… You know, we really tried to keep the water inside the tub. It was a pretty big deal, but now, they want the floors wet, that’s what they want. They want to do no glass, but I’m still alive, so they’re like, “All right, do half a glass.” “Once that guy’s gone, we’ll do no glass, floors are wet, drains off the balcony.” When I first started going on the road, I would have to do a wake-up call. That’s how I got up in the morning. I’d have to call a guy I don’t know, and just be like, “Will you wake me up tomorrow?”', '[crowd laughing, applauding]', 'That’s the last person I would talk to, was him. I would call my wife, then a man I’ve never seen. “You promise you gonna wake me up tomorrow?” We would tell each other good night. So no one’s done a wake-up call in probably 20 years now. So this guy on the road with us, he’s 24 years old, he’s never done a wake-up call in his life. And so, we’re staying at a hotel, and he saw the wake-up call on the phone. And he goes, “I’m going to do a wake-up call.” And I told him, I go, “Don’t do it.” “I mean, that’s like an ashtray on an airplane.” He was like, “No, I want to do it.” “All right.” So he set it up. Next morning, his phone rings, he doesn’t answer the phone. He doesn’t know that’s the main part of your job. You gotta answer the phone and let the guy know you’re awake. So then that guy, who’s young too probably, is like, “I guess I got to go knock on the door.” “I’ve never even seen this service used so it must be the most important person alive.” So he goes up and he starts knocking on the door. My buddy still doesn’t answer the door. So the guy goes in the room. I swear this is real, ’cause look, this is two young people, they don’t know what they’re doing. So he goes in the room, like, “Do I have to touch this guy?” “Is that what a wake-up call is?” “I gotta touch a guy I’ve never seen, in the dark?” So I’d imagine he started making noises, just going, “Hep. Hey, now! Hep!” “Hep, hep, hep. Hep!” Hoping he doesn’t have to touch this man. But he had to touch him. I swear, that’s what he told me. He woke up to another guy going, “Hey, buddy.” “It’s time to wake up.”', 'Thank you so much.', '[crowd cheering]', '♪ Feeling good, like I should ♪', '[“Sunday Best” by Surfaces playing]', '♪ Went and took a walk Around the neighborhood ♪ ♪ Feeling blessed, never stressed ♪ ♪ Got that sunshine On my Sunday best, yeah ♪ ♪ Every day can be a better day Despite the challenge ♪ ♪ All you gotta do is leave it Better than you found it ♪ ♪ It’s gonna get difficult to stand But hold your balance ♪ ♪ I just say whatever ‘Cause there is no way around it ♪ ♪ Everyone falls down sometimes ♪ ♪ But you just gotta know It’ll all be fine ♪ ♪ It’s okay ♪', '[dramatic jingle playing]'], ['[siren wailing]', '[somber music playing]', '[Harvey Levin] Jamie Foxx suffered a very serious medical emergency.', 'Bad enough that family members flew in.', 'Actor Jamie Foxx is asking for prayers as the actor has now spent more than two weeks in an Atlanta hospital.

He says, “Foxx, that’s your nurse.” I said, “What kind of old man shit is that?” So, the first night, she says, “Okay. Time for the showers.” I say, “Okay. Somebody put me in the chair, get me to the water, I’ll knock it out.” She says, “No, I’m gonna bathe you.” I said, “No, the fuck you ain’t.” She says, “Well… “I say, “No, no, no.” “You not finna… No. You not finna see this pickle.” [audience laughs] She said, “What you mean?” I say, “Uh-uh.

Your girl… Ever pull your drawers up? “Bitch. Hold on!” [crowd laughs] “What’s wrong?” “Ain’t nothin’ in this motherfucker yet.” And that shit be stuck to your thighs. She’s like, “Are you okay?” “No!

I’m like, “Fuck!” [inhales sharply] “Shit!” “She’s seen it!” “And I don’t remember her seein’ it!” So it hit me. I ain’t seen my dick in 20 days.

I didn’t do nothin’.” [audience laughs] Uh… [chuckling] [clicks tongue] Then it was the process of the therapist. They’d bring therapists for my therapy, and I didn’t want to hear that shit. I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need no fuckin’ therapists. Why did this shit even happen to me? I’m Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx. So, every therapist that came in, I said, “Get the fuck out.” “I don’t want to do this shit.” I… I… I felt like, uh, Wesley Snipes in New Jack City. When he was at the table at the end and Gee Money would walk up. [as Gee] “Yo, you, Nino.” [as Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] “Huh.” “Is that what this is about?

I don’t want to see no therapist.” They say, “You got a second chance.” “I don’t want a second chance.” “What’s wrong with my first chance?” What’s wrong with my first chance? So, I was… irreverent. I was… I gave up. [sniffles] Then… I heard in the other part of the room… I heard ’em go, “We need Holly.” [audience chuckles] Who the fuck is that? “We need Holly for this one. Only Holly can get him goin’.” “Holly is the one.” I’m like, “I don’t give a fuck about no Holly.” “She gon’ get the same shit.” “And she comin’ here on that bullshit.” You know them movies, “It’s only one person could do this.” “We gotta get Holly.” I’m like, “Man, bull-Holly.’', '[sniffles]', '[audience laughs] I’m layin’ in my bed.

[woman 2] Oh. [man] Damn, bro. She said, “I can help you, Jamie Foxx.” [sniffles] “But you gotta tell me what’s really goin’ on with you.” “You’re dizzy, right?” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” “You’re so dizzy, you can’t walk.” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” She says, “You remember the movie Karate Kid?” I say, “Yes.” She said, “We gonna wax on… [with audience]…wax off.”', '[audience cheers]', 'I said, “What that mean?” She says, “I’m gonna help you with that so you can go back to bein’ a man.” She said, “Take your right hand, and put it on your left shoulder.” “Your left hand on your right shoulder. Now close your eyes.” And I fell. She picked me back up. “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “I want you to look left, and I want you to look right.” I look left. I look right. I fell. She said, “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “This is it. Look left and look right.” I look left. I look right. I got that. And then she said, “Now, Jamie Foxx, now you got that? I want you to look up and look down.” I look up, look down, I got dizzy. I fell back in my bed, and I said, “Miss Holly, I don’t want to do this no more, man.” “What has happened to me?” [shakily] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “I don’t want to do this.” And she said, “I got 15 more minutes left.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, motherfucka.”', '[applause]', '[woman] Holly! “You look left, and you look right.” I looked left, right.

Look down!” I said, “Yeah.” “You gotta kill that old Jamie Foxx in order for the new Jamie Foxx to walk outta here.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker!” [audience cheers] Next morning came, Holly came in. I was already out of bed. “Hey, bitch.”', '[audience laughs]', '“I knew you was coming, bitch. I’m up!” “Knock it the fuck off.” “Left, right, up, down. Get the fuck outta here.” So I got down again, and Holly took me into the big facility, but there’s other patients in there, and I was down in the dumps. She says, “What’s your fuckin’ problem?” “What is your problem? You don’t want to fight?” She said, “Jamie, when you walk in this facility, look to the left of you, people that ain’t gonna get outta here.”', '[audience groans]', 'And I did.

Now, you know if I was to say that, that’s what TMZ would report.', '[imitates news fanfare]', '[imitating TMZ announcer] “Jamie Foxx said his white doctor had to call him ‘n*gga’ in order to stay alive.” That’s not what happened.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah. All right? He actually said, “Get these Black motherfuckers outta here.” No, I’m kidding. But it was real. My vitals were so bad, they were gonna lose me. And… that’s when a miracle happened, and that miracle was working through my youngest daughter. She’s 14. I didn’t want her to see me like that. But she snuck into my hospital room with her guitar. [crowd] Aww. And she says, “I know what my daddy needs.” [breathing shakily] She said, “That’s my daddy.” What’s interesting is my daughter used to carry her guitar all the time with her. And they said, when she was playing, my vitals… went down. The nurses at the nurses’ station were baffled. Like, “Wow, what did they give him?” So they rushed into the room, and she said, “Shh.” [softly] I got him. My daughter used to carry that guitar when she was ten years old. She would carry it everywhere. She carried it everywhere. I was like, “You gonna carry a guitar?” Going to Disneyland, she got that guitar. [crowd laughs] We going to a football game, she got that guitar. Everywhere we went, she had the guitar. But you know what I found out? It was God in that guitar.', '[women] Yes.', '[crowd applauds] God was in that guitar. That’s my spiritual defibrillator. [crowd] Aww. [crowd cheering] [woman] Aww! That’s Anelise.

I want to get through this ’cause every time I run into somebody now, that I haven’t seen in a while, I cry. ‘Cause y’all my people. You’ve known me for so long, so every time I run… Especially when I run into my homies. I ran into T.I., I cried. I think he kinda cried… But he was like… [as T.I.] “What you sayin’, my n*gga?” “What you sayin’ with me, partner?” “I pray for you, partner. Period.” “I pray for your partner. I pray for you. I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, partner.” “I prayed expeditiously for you, n*gga.” [audience laughing] But every time I run into somebody, I cry. I ran into T.I., I cried. I ran into Candice Parker, I cried. Then, somehow, I ran into Halle Berry. [audience exclaims] I didn’t cry as much.', '[crowd laughs]', '‘Cause Halle just rushed me and hugged me so tight. I was like, “Ooh, Lord, have mercy, Jesus.” “This here is Halle Berry.” And she don’t realize how fucking sexy she is. And I don’t want to blow the moment ’cause it was heartfelt. She said, “Jamie, oh my God!” And she hugged me. I said, “Ooh, oh, my gosh.” She said, “There’s so much I wanted to tell you.” And I said, “There’s so much I gotta tell you!” ‘Cause she was huggin’ me. I’m like, “Oh my God.” “Please don’t let me disrespect this moment.” So I had to relay… ‘Cause the hug was so nice, I had to relay to my pickle. “Hey, stand down, n*gga. This ain’t that kind of hug.” He shot back, “Shit!”', '[audience laughs]', '“N*gga, that’s Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” “Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” I’m like, “Man, don’t blow this for me, my n*gga. She’ll feel it!” “Please!” And she’s holding me. She’s talkin’ to me, this close to my ear. I said, “Goddamn!” She right here in my ear. I said, “Damn!” Know how women pretty like that always have a fragrance you’ve never smelled. That shit… I said… [sniffs] “Ooh, what the fuck is that?” “God, this smells like Heaven.” I said… [inhales] I took that shit in, and she was hugging me. I said, “Oh, God, please. Please stay with me, Lord. Please.” “Don’t let me fuck this moment up.” She hugged, and then she… As I tried to pull away, she hugged tighter. Oof. I said, “Good God Almighty.” [crowd laughs] And I could feel my hips. I said, “Hips! Hips, stop! Stop!” But I did just clench up to let her know I’m there.', '[crowd laughs]', 'So she’s huggin’ me, and I’m trying to get out of this moment, and as I’m trying to push away from her heartfelt sexual grip, I tried to push away, know what she did? She kissed me on my neck. [crowd exclaims] And n*gga, I came… [crowd exclaims] …to my senses! [crowd laughing] You nasty motherfuckers. Yo, man, I ain’t finna come like that with Halle. And as she was huggin’ me, “Oh my God, thank you so much.” So Halle, when you see this, please understand what I’m sayin’. You just so beautiful. That’s all we wanna say. Halle you’re beautiful. So she let me go. She let me out of her clutches. I said, “Thank you, Jesus!” But then, I felt a rumblin’. I felt something rumbling. I said, “Ooh, whee!” “I can’t wait.” So I rushed to the bathroom to see what was rumblin’. And I pulled my pants down, and I said, “Oh, shit!” “Somebody back!” [laughs] “Somebody back!” And then I ask him, “Hey, n*gga, what got into you?” Know what he said? “Sometimes, you gotta pop out and show n*ggas.”', '[intense beat playing]', '♪ We back!

[laughter] It would be like a cat with a cat toy.', '[laughter]', '[woman whoops]', 'I got married to my awesome wife, Jax, in October 2020.', '[cheering]', 'Thank you. In the middle of the “pandemie.” So when it came to our honeymoon, I wanted to go all out. Uh, Jax picked the place. She wanted to go to the Maldives. Uh, a travel agent planned everything. I just showed up. I found out, on the plane, it takes 24 hours to get there. Yeah, that’s a lot. I would’ve been fine with Chuck E. Cheese. [laughter] So about 12 hours into this flight, I was like, “You know what? I should learn something about the Maldives.” “I don’t know anything about this country.” And Jax had brought this little book of fun facts, so I start reading some fun facts. It said that the Maldives is in the Indian Ocean. Great. It’s comprised of 1,200 islands. Awesome. I read some more fun facts. It said, “It is illegal to be gay… in the Maldives.” [laughter] [laughter] I’m like, “We’re going on our gay honeymoon…” [laughter] “…to a country where it is illegal to be gay.”', 'So I’m like, “Ha-ha, okay, um…”', '[laughter]', '“…maybe it’s an old law, it’s not in practice anymore.” And it said, “Oh no.” That’s what it said in the book. “Oh no.” [laughter] “It is illegal to be gay.” “At whatever time you’re reading this, it’s illegal.” [laughter]', 'It can lead to eight years in prison.', '[audience groans] Yeah! Lashings. I don’t even know what that is, but I don’t want it. [laughter] So I’m on the plane, looking at my brand-new bride with very different eyes. [laughter] All the romance has left my body. ‘Cause here’s the problem. Between the two of us, only one of us can pass for being straight. [laughter] [whooping] And the other one gets called “sir” every time she walks into a bathroom.', '[laughter]', 'Yeah. Happened to me at Disneyland. I was coming out of the bathroom. I got called “sir.” And I didn’t know what to say, so I turned around and I said, “It’s ma’am!” [laughter] Then I walked out like this. [laughter] I can see how that’s confusing. I was like, “All right, I need to look at this itinerary.” It said that 18 hours into this 24-hour flight, we actually have an overnight layover. And our overnight layover is in Qatar. [laughter and groans] Now, I don’t know if you guys knew this, but it is more illegal… [laughter] …to be gay in Qatar. It can lead to life in prison. Floggings. Again, what is this? [laughter] We’ve now landed. We’re walking into the hotel. I’m panicked. And Jax says, “Listen, when you get nervous, you offer up way too much information.”', '[laughter]', '“Now is not the time.” So we have one room booked. We’re filling out the paperwork. And the woman at the front desk asks, “One bed or two?”', '[audience chuckling]', '[laughter] And Jax isn’t answering. And I could find myself shifting. I’m turning into a pretty little lady.', '[laughter]', '[audience whoops, applauds]', 'I said, “We’d like two beds.” “I’m traveling with my cousin.” [laughter] “We’re going to the Maldives.” “Our husbands are already there.” [laughter] “They were roommates and fraternity brothers in college.” “They just love going on these guy trips and playing golf and smoking cigars.” “We’re just gonna have a little girl time.” “We’re gonna get our nails done and go shopping.” “None of that gay shit’s going on here!”', '[laughter]', 'Jax is like, “Shut up!” [laughter] We get our keys. We run up to the room. I’m acting like there’s cameras inside of the hotel room. I did, in fact, sleep in that other double bed on the first night of my honeymoon. I slept in a nightgown. Head-to-toe nightgown. [laughter] I don’t even know how that got in my bag. You just land in Qatar and a nightgown appears in your luggage. I kept having these nightmares that someone would break in the room and put me in handcuffs. And as they’re hauling me off, I look back at Jax and I yell, “Tell my story, cousin!” [laughter] Next morning, we run to the plane. Six-hour flight. Land in the Maldives. Then we take an hour puddle jumper to a remote island. And there’s a woman from the resort, on the dock, holding a bucket of Heinekens for all the passengers. It’s a very fancy place. [laughter] Jax goes to reach for these Heinekens, and I go, “Aah! No!” “Lesbian! Beer!” “It’s a trap!”', '[screams]', '[audience laughing] I flung it out of her hand and ran like a damsel in distress.', 'Ah!', '[laughter] I was like, “Oh my God.” “What if this island is just full of a bunch of gay booby traps?” [laughter] “What if they offer us free Crocs?” [laughter] “How am I gonna turn that down?” [laughter] I was afraid there would be a granola trail leading to a bottomless pit. I was like, “I’m not gonna be able to swim all week, ’cause everybody knows I swim in an XXXL T-shirt with the sleeves cut off and a pair of sweatpants.” [laughter] “It’s my lesbian swimsuit.” [audience cheers] I just wanna be under the radar. Normally, on your honeymoon, you’re shouting it from the rooftops. We get to our bungalow, and there’s a cake waiting for us that says “Happy honeymoon.” I was like, “Aah!” I grabbed it and I threw it in the ocean. [laughter] I ate a slice first. I’m not crazy. [laughter] We were there for a whole week. We got one picture together. Jax and I are standing seven feet apart… [laughter] …with a random family in between us, just both giving a thumbs-up.', '[audience laughing, clapping]', 'It was the least romantic trip of our lives. But a beautiful country. I highly recommend it to all of you non-gay folks. [laughter] I’m learning a lot about marriage. Uh, communication, very important. You have to learn how to fight, because that is an inevitable part of communication. Now, if you are in a newer relationship and you wanna figure out how each other handles stress, you should travel together. Because traveling is stressful. It is why Louise drove Thelma off that cliff. [laughter] “I told you not to eat my snacks.” [laughter] Now, early on in our relationship, Jax and I, uh, we went to Italy, and we landed in Rome, and we had to take a train from Rome to Naples. Those train stations are so chaotic. Our train’s leaving in 30 minutes. We don’t know where our platform is. And at the time, Jax was a kindergarten teacher, so she would talk to me like I was a five-year-old. [laughter] She even said, at one point, “When the hand goes up, the mouth goes shut.”', '[laughter]', '[whispers] Wow. And it works. So we had to figure out where to go, and she bends down and she goes, “Hey!” “Are you listening?” [laughter] “Hey!” I’m like, “Yes.” She said, “I want you to stay right here.” “Okay?” “Stay right here and hold our luggage, ’cause you’re a little bit stronger than me.” “I’m gonna go find our platform, ’cause I’m a little bit smarter than you.” [laughter] I was like, “You could’ve ended on the compliment.” She said, “Whatever you do, do not leave.” I’m like, “I got it. God!” [laughter] She said, “Did you wash your hands?” [laughter] “Yes.” “Let me smell ’em.” “No!” [laughter] So she leaves. I’m standing there. It’s so hot. People are passing by me, speaking Italian. They’re like, “Pizza. Pasta. Meatball.” [laughter] Now I’m hungry. She’s been gone forever, so I start showing people our ticket, and someone points me in the right direction. I’m like, “I know Jax told me to stay right here, but I think I could be more helpful if I go to the train, in the air-conditioning, put our bags up.” “I can start eating biscotti, and I’ll text her where to go.” [laughter] So I leave this spot.', '[audience murmurs]', 'Don’t you turn on me! [laughter] I go to the train, put our bags up, I start popping biscotti, and I text Jax where to go. It’s 15 minutes till our train’s leaving. She does not answer. Ten minutes till the train’s leaving, I call her. She doesn’t answer that. It’s now five minutes till our train’s leaving, and I’m like, “Well, one of us should enjoy this trip.” [laughter] Three minutes till our train’s leaving, I have one foot on, one foot off. I’m looking down the platform like, “Oh my God. Oh my God.” I spot Jax. I wave her down, and she starts running as hard as she can down this platform. I’m like, “Oh my God.” “This is so romantic.” [laughter] “I have never had anyone run down a platform for me.” She gets on the train, doors shut right behind her. And I go…', '♪ Reunited, and it feels… ♪', 'And she goes, “What the fuck?” [laughter] Ugh! That’s not part of my rom-com! [laughter] Julia Roberts doesn’t say “What the fuck?” She says, “I have been looking for you for the last 20 minutes.” I said, “I texted you.” She said, “My phone doesn’t work in Europe.” I said, “I don’t know your phone plan.” [laughter] Then the entire train shushed us, and they pointed at a sign. It turns out, we had accidentally bought a ticket on the quiet car. [laughter] I would’ve never bought a ticket on the quiet car, ’cause I’m like, “How we gon’ chat?” [laughter] But now, Jax wants to fight, and I’m like, “Thank God we got tickets on the quiet car.” [laughter] She’s going in, and I go… [mouthing silently]', '[laughter]', '[laughter and applause]', '[audience cheering]', 'I sit down so proud of myself, thinking I have gotten out of a fight. She found a new way to fight. She goes… [mouthing silently]', '[audience laughing]', 'This goes on for, like, 45 minutes. [laughter] We were so exhausted from mime-fighting… [laughter] …that we completed two of our exercise rings on our Apple Watches. [laughter] We both eventually passed out. Hour and a half later, we woke up in Naples, biscotti’s rolling down my shirt. Totally forgot what we were fighting about. So my advice to all of you new couples is, go to bed angry. I’m telling you, just sleep it off. It works for bears. Why can’t it work for us? [laughter] [whooping]', '[cheering]', 'And if you go to Europe and you take a train, just know, one of you is gonna mess up. So I highly recommend you book a ticket on the quiet car. It could save your relationship. It is much cheaper than a therapist, and it comes with biscotti. So that is my advice to you guys.', '[audience cheering]', '[Fortune laughs] Now, I never had a serious relationship before Jax. She is definitely my most serious relationship. Now, my parents divorced when I was 12, and I don’t know how this happened, but I somehow became my mom’s husband. [laughter] Which is weird because I have two older brothers, so… [laughter] …I don’t know why I was the man of the house. But I had to make sure everything was okay. I set her alarm clock every night. As I got older, I became my mom’s plus-one in social situations. When I was in college, my mom and I went on trips that were way too romantic for, like, a mother and daughter. We went to New York City and shared frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity, and we walked arm in arm in Central Park. And when you’re single, there’s no one to be like, “Hey, that’s weird. You’re on a date with your mom.” [laughter] When I moved to LA, she and I went on a Christmas Caribbean cruise together. Yeah, shared a room. That’s too much time with your mom. [laughter] I started dreaming of icebergs.', '[laughter]', '[Fortune chuckles] I said, “Mom, why don’t you go out there on the ship and try to meet somebody your own age?” She goes, “Why would I wanna meet somebody when I have you?” I’m like, “Oh my God.” [laughter] We are headed for a Grey Gardens situation. [laughter] “Mom, stop talking to that squirrel!” [laughter] I got a break at one point from being her husband. She got a boyfriend. Yeah. They met in the newspaper, in the classified ads. No pictures. You just had to like each other’s grammar. [laughter] But she was a single mom of three kids, and she was a schoolteacher, so she was broke. And after date one, she was sold on this guy. She comes home. She goes, “I like him.” “He is rich.” [laughter] I said, “How do you know?” “‘Cause he told me.” Oh, okay!', '[laughter]', '[chuckles] Sure. She goes, “I know from three things.” I said, “That’s very specific.” She goes, “Number one, he drives a Mercedes convertible.” “That is rich.” I said, “Yeah, but what year is it?” ‘Cause when I was in high school, I drove a BMW, but it was 20 years old. And it was a stick shift, and it would just stall in the middle of intersections. And I would have to Fred Flintstone this car out of the intersection to keep from getting hit. When I was going down hills, sometimes the brakes would just give out, so I had to pull up the emergency brake in order to come to a complete stop. And when it rained, dirty rainwater would seep through the sunroof, so I would have to drive with my head tilted to keep from getting pink eye. [laughter] I’m just saying, follow-up questions are important. She said, “Number two, he has his own tanning bed.”', 'I was like…', '[laughter] [retches softly] Now, for all you young’uns out there, tanning beds were all the rage in the ’90s. People were hopping in those things left and right. It was like the cold plunge of today. [laughter] [Fortune chuckles] Instead of helping with circulation, it could cause cancer. But, oh, you looked great in the winter. “And number three…” She was the most impressed with this. She thought this was the measure of success. She says, “He owns his very own industrial crushed-ice machine.” [laughter] “He is rich.” She would go to his house on the weekends, and take a cooler… [laughter] …and fill it up with crushed ice, come home like she was holding a golden bounty. [laughter] “Crushed ice for a week.” I was like, “Dinner would be nice, but slushies it is.” Couple years later, they broke up. My mom was crushed. [laughter] Sorry. [laughter continues]', 'Sorry.', '[whooping] She was… crushed, unlike her ice. She had to go back to that broke ice. The ice in the trays, where you’re filling it up with water, and you’re like… trying to put it in the freezer, and everything’s spilling, you’re like, “Ugh!” No, I didn’t meet Jax until I was 35. My mom had gotten very comfortable, uh, with me being her husband. And at 35, she did not think I was in danger of getting took. [laughter] So something happened when I met Jax that I did not expect. My mom got a little jealous.', '[audience murmurs]', 'Yeah. I remember if I would buy Jax something, like a scarf, my mom would be like, “I like scarves.” I’m like, “You’re not my girlfriend.” [laughter] [Fortune sighs] Their birthdays are five days apart, which is my nightmare. [laughter] I get heart palpitations in February. I remember, early on in my relationship, it was very popular to go on Facebook and profess your love for whoever you were with. So Jax’s birthday, I go on Facebook, and I’m like, “I love you so much.” “You’re the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me.” [imitates vomiting] [imitates vomiting] [laughter] I posted, like, 30 pictures in a collage that took five hours to put together. [laughter] Five days later, I call my mom. “Hey, Mom. Happy birthday.”', '[laughter]', '“Thank you.” “Are you okay?” “I’m fine.” “Well, what are you doing?” “I’m on Facebook.” [laughter] “I was looking at my messages, and I don’t see one from you, and I know your thumbs work ’cause you used them five days ago.” [laughter] “I sent you an edible arrangement. What is this?” But she was pissed. So I had to unfriend her. [laughter] [cheering] [Fortune chuckles] I don’t know if any of you guys have ever had to break up with your mom. [laughter] Awkward! Once Jax and I got married, she had another family she had to deal with. She’d get a little jealous if I spent more time with Jax’s family than my family. And I was like, “Well, Jax’s mom makes us apple pancakes…” [laughter] “…and you just asked me to borrow $500.” [laughter] [chuckles] It’s just different. It’s just different. But she does love Jax. She does. She just thinks that Jax stole her man.', '[laughter]', '[Fortune tuts] My wife is Jolene.', '[laughter]', '[audience cheering]', 'But I fly home to North Carolina to have some one-on-one time with my parents. They like that. I don’t know what it is about going to my hometown, but I immediately revert into a 15-year-old. I could rent a car. I am 25. [laughter] My mom insists on driving me everywhere, so now I have to ask her permission to go places. She has to approve who I hang out with. It’s very weird as an adult. Even my taste buds revert back to when I was in high school. Like, when I’m in the South, I don’t wanna eat at a Michelin star restaurant. I don’t even trust their tires. [laughter] When I’m home, I wanna eat fried food, and I wanna eat biscuits. [cheering] For the European folks watching, these biscuits are like your guys’s, but, uh, they’re fluffier, and they have eight more sticks of butter. [laughter] Now, I love a place back home called Bojangles.', '[whooping]', 'Pretty tasty biscuits! But the one place that I don’t think gets enough credit is a fast-food chain called Hardee’s.', 'Are you guys familiar with Hardee’s?', '[cheering] Now, if you don’t know Hardee’s, it’s owned by Carl’s Jr. Very similar vibes, but Hardee’s is known for their biscuits. I’d have to fact-check this, but I think it’s called Hardee’s ’cause it could clog your heart and your arteries. [laughter] But, mmm! Worth it. Now, every woman has a biological clock. Mine is set to know when fast-food chains stop serving breakfast. [laughter] [woman whoops] And Hardee’s ends at 10:30. Last time I was home, I overslept, ’cause my mom didn’t wake me up. [laughter] And I woke up in a panic. I was like, “I need some biscuits!” And I looked at my watch. It said it was 10:15. I go, “Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!” “Mom! Mom!” “I gotta borrow your car. I gotta go get some biscuits.” She said, “My car is in the driveway, and it’s already running.”', '[laughter]', '“Why is your car already running?” “Well, I was driving it this morning, and I realized that if I turned it off, it might not turn back on, so I left it running in the driveway for the last hour, just in case we need it.” I was like, “I don’t have time to get into the nuts and bolts of this.” [laughter] “I guess I’m glad you left it running in the driveway and not the garage.” [laughter] “I gotta go get my biscuits.” So I threw on my flannel, got in her car, and I drive across town to the Hardee’s. It’s a small town. I get to the drive-through at 10:22. There’s a line to the street. I’m like, “Oh God. Everybody wants biscuits.” Now, normally, I would park the car, run in, get those biscuits, but I’ll remind you that if I turn this car off, it might not turn back on, and there ain’t no Ubers in this tiny-ass town, and y’all know I’m not walking.', '[laughter]', 'So I’m waiting in the line like, “Come on! Come on!” 10:28, I get up to the speaker, and I just yell, “Biscuits!” [laughter] You can’t waste time. [laughter] She accepts the order. I’m like, “Yes!” And then that car dies, dead as a doornail, right there in the middle of that drive-through line. I’m like, “No, no, no, no, no, no, no!” She goes, “No? You don’t want biscuits?” I go, “No, no, no, I want biscuits.” “I’m in my mom’s car, and my mom’s car just died.” She goes, “I’ll cancel the biscuits.” “No, no, no, please, don’t cancel the biscuits.” “Will you just ring ’em up, put ’em up front?” “I’ll get rid of this car, I’ll come in, and I’ll get those biscuits.” She goes, “You’ve got two minutes.”', '[audience gasps]', '[lightly] Bitch!', '[laughter]', 'So I don’t know what to do. I can’t walk through the drive-through. I’ve tried twice at midnight. They do not like that. [laughter] I don’t know how I’m gonna get rid of this car. But you know how a mom gets that mom strength when her baby’s in trouble? And she’s gotta, like, lift up a bus to save her baby? [huffs] Well, all of a sudden, I got that mom strength, but for me, my baby was biscuits. [laughter] So I put the car in neutral, I get out of the car, and I turn into an American Gladiator. [laughter] And I start pushing this car, inch by inch. I’m like… [grunting with effort] [laughter] [prolonged grunt] I sound like a feral cat. [high-pitched grunt] These two guys in a truck behind me get out of their truck to come help me. All they see are my broad shoulders from behind, and they go, “Oh, he’s got it.” [laughter] And got right back in their truck. I’m T-Rexing this car…', '[grunts]', '[woman whoops] [grunts] I’m sweating my tits off, which is even more confusing for those guys. [laughter] [grunts] I’m in the zone. There’s one minute left. There’s parking spaces across the way. I give the car one last “goosh.” This car starts rolling. I start sprinting towards the door. At least, I think I’m sprinting. [laughter] Thirty seconds. I can smell the biscuits. It’s like the Olympics of the South. All of a sudden, I hear a “boom!” I look up. Everyone in the Hardee’s is staring at me. I had pushed that car so hard, it rolled through the parking space, over an embankment, into a ravine. The hood popped open. Smoke’s billowing out of it. The alarm’s going off. The trunk popped open. I’m like, “Oh my God!” “Biscuits!”', '[audience cheering]', 'Got the biscuits. Shoved ’em in my mouth. “I did it!”', '[laughter]', 'I was so proud of myself. I called my mom to tell her what happened. And she told me I was grounded. [laughter] She said, “You are never driving my car again.” I said, “Ain’t nobody driving that car again.” “But I got my biscuits.” [audience cheering] But honestly, I don’t know if my parents should be driving anymore. They’re older now. They’re in their late seventies. And I don’t know, as their kid, when do I have to have that talk with them to tell them they can’t drive? Now, I know with my grandmother, what happened with her is she was driving one day, and she was just chatting away, and then all of a sudden, she went across four lanes of traffic. And we said, “Well, Nana, that’s that.” [laughter] She said, “I didn’t even realize I was driving.”', 'Mm-hmm.', '[laughter] “Yep.” “We’re gonna need those keys.” [laughter] We’re getting closer with my mom. I can feel it. We had just bought her a new car, and she called me up and just very casually said, “Hey!” “I just drove off a cliff.” [laughter] “What?!” “I was driving, I rounded a curb, and I drove off a cliff.” “I heard you!” [laughter] “I just don’t understand what you’re telling me.” “My car flew through the air.” [laughter] “It landed on a large hill, and then it rolled down to safety.” [laughter] “Okay, but how did this happen, Mom? Were you texting?” “No, I wasn’t texting. I wasn’t talking. Nothing.” “Okay, well, did another car swerve into your lane?” “No, there were no other cars anywhere near me.” “Was it bad weather? Was it raining?” “Mm-mm.” [laughter] “It was a beautiful sunny day.” “One of the best we’ve had in a long time.” [laughter] “Was it a sharp curve?” “Nope. It was a very normal, very approachable curve.” [laughter] I said, “You didn’t do this on purpose, did you?” “No! I had just watched a pickleball tournament.” “I have a lot to live for.” [laughter] She said, “I just drove off a cliff.” [laughter] And then she said one of the greatest things I have ever heard. She said, “It was bound to happen one of these days.” [laughter] [chuckles] What?! [laughter] “Well, Ginger, that’s that.” “We’re gonna need those keys.”', '[laughter]', '[Fortune chuckles]', '[audience cheering, applauding]', '[whistling, whooping]', 'Now, my mom has always been quirky, for sure, but it is getting worse with age. Like, I truly never know what is gonna be on the other end of any given phone call. She called me last year, and she goes, “Hey.” “I just wanna start by saying I’m okay.” I’m like… [laughter] Jax was like, “I’m going in the other room.” “This is gonna be a while.” [chuckles] She said, “Well, it had just finished raining, and I decided to drive to the cemetery to check on our family plot.” [laughter] I was like, “Normally, that’s the one place you don’t have to worry about.” [laughter] “Well, you would think.” “But it’s a good thing I drove down there, ’cause when I pulled up, I noticed a fresh mound of dirt on our family plot.” “So I got out of the car to get a closer look, and as I’m walking, I realize that some stranger had been buried in our family plot.” I was like, “Oh, I did not see that coming, for sure.” She said, “I walked closer to see whose name was on the marker, and when I got over there, all of a sudden, my foot fell through the grave.” [laughter] “I panicked.” “I panicked because I realized that my foot was about to touch the casket.” [laughter] “I could not bear the thought of that, so I jerked my foot out of that grave, and when that happened, I fell on the ground.” “Well, while I was on the ground, I realized I have fallen, and I can’t get up.”', '[laughter]', \"[Fortune scoffs] I’m like, “Oh my God. We have reached the Life Alert stage.” [laughter] “It’s worse than I thought.” She said, “I didn’t have my phone on me. I wasn’t expecting to get out of the car.” “I couldn’t get up. I didn’t know what to do.” “So I started to crawl across the cemetery.” [laughter] “Why are you crawling across the cemetery?” “Well, I thought I could crawl across the cemetery, I could go over to the curb, I could sit on the curb, and from there, I could hoist myself up.” “Well, when I got to the curb, I could not hoist myself up, so I just sat there.” “Well, apparently, while this was happening, there was a couple who was driving past the cemetery.” “They looked over, and they saw some thing covered in dirt crawling across the cemetery.” [laughter] “And they thought, ‘Hmm, I wonder what that is.'” “‘Let’s go check.'” I said, “There is no world in which I am driving past a cemetery, I look over and I see some thing covered in dirt crawling across the cemetery, and I’m like, ‘Hmm, I wonder what that is.'” “‘Let’s go check.'” That ain’t happening. [laughter] She said, “Well, they pulled in the cemetery, and when they pulled up to me, it turned out, they were older than me.” [laughter] “They couldn’t help me up, so I asked to borrow their phone.” I said, “Oh, to call a friend?” “No. I called the fire department.” [laughter] “Why?! You are not a cat in a tree!” She said, “Hello. This is Ginger Feimster.” “Fortune Feimster’s mother.” “Do not bring me into this!”\", '[laughter and cheering]', '“I am in the cemetery, and I have fallen, and I can’t get up.” [laughter and cheering] “Can you please send someone to come get me up?” “But whatever you do, do not drive that large fire truck.” “That would be so embarrassing.” [laughter] And they said, “Ma’am, that is our only mode of transportation.” She said, “So all of a sudden, here came this large fire truck barreling through the cemetery, and then five firemen in full gear got out of the truck.” I’m like, “Oh my God!” These poor firemen. They’re just trying to eat a spaghetti dinner. [laughter] The alarm rings, and they’re like, “Let’s go save some lives!” They put on 300 pounds of gear. They get in their fire truck. They race across town, risking their lives. They pull into the cemetery, and it’s just an old woman on a curb going… [laughter] She said, “One of them got behind me and just went boop and got me right up.” [laughter] “So that was my day.” [laughter] “I had one foot in the grave.” I’m like… [mouthing inaudibly]', '[audience cheering]', 'That is my mother, Ginger Feimster. So, of course, you can imagine, when I met Jax, she was like, “What of that is in your DNA?”', '[laughter]', '[Fortune chuckles] I’m like, “Won’t it be fun to find out?” No, I’m quirky too. I’m definitely very quirky. But I’ve learned to channel it into my performances. Now, I’ve actually been doing this a lot longer than people realize. I was not in, like, theater in school. I was too busy lezzing out on the softball field. [laughter and cheering] But I actually got my start, uh, with performing at church, which is not usually where you think of the arts. [laughter] But my very first musical ever was about Jonah and the whale. And no, I was not the whale, you assholes! [laughter] I was a sailor. It was a very progressive United Methodist Church. [laughter] I had to throw Jonah overboard for disobeying God, and… it was a lot of pressure, you know? My grandma’s in the fourth pew. The Lord’s watching. I didn’t wanna go to church unless I knew it was show day, and then I was like, “And a five, six, seven, eight.” [laughter] I brought a baton to church once… [laughter] …and just started twirling it in front of the congregation. But I was like, “I need to tie this in.” So I just started saying books of the Bible. I was like, “Deuteronomy.” “Genesis.” “Thessalonians.” “Corinthians.” “Job.” [laughter]', '[audience cheering]', '[Fortune chuckles] I was a star pupil. I was even in the kids’ choir. I got all of the solos until my nemesis moved into town, Becky fucking Johnson.', '[laughter]', '[audience boos]', 'We were 12 years old. All the boys thought she was so cute and pretty and had the best personality, and I thought she was a real bitch. [laughter] She made my life hell. She was cute though. [laughter] But she challenged me to the solo, and the choir director told the boys in our group that they could pick the winner.', '[audience laments]', 'Thank you! So I decided I was gonna watch the adult choir, and I would just emulate the women from the adult choir, not realizing that I’m 12 and they’re 70-year-old former opera singers. [laughter] So my very first audition, I sang this.', '♪ Oh Lord, my God ♪\\n♪ When I in ♪\\n♪ Awesome wonder ♪\\n♪ Consider all thy works ♪\\n♪ Thy hands hath made ♪', '[audience cheering, applauding]', 'A freakin’ shoo-in! [laughter] And then Becky fucking Johnson pulled out a boob, got the part. [laughter] That’s where I learned that this business is cutthroat, baby. [laughter] Even at church. The competition continued into the kids’ handbell choir. Ooh, it was very competitive. We practiced every Wednesday night for three hours. No school credit. No snacks. No bathroom breaks. One kid shit his pants… [laughter] …and had to keep ringing like nothing happened. [laughter] [laughter continues] We’re all smelling it, like, “Agh!” [laughter] [retching] [laughter] “Is this worth it?”', '[laughter]', 'But we hung in there ’cause once every three months, we got to have a big performance in front of the entire congregation. Now, they would line these bells up in order of size. The smallest up here. The biggest down here. Nobody wanted anything to do with these bells. This was the melody. These were the bass bells. It was like playing the tuba. The tuba sounds like you’re playing farts. Blech! Gross! [laughter] But our choir director would only let the little skinny pretty girls, like Becky fucking Johnson, play these bells. Now, I developed before everybody. I was very tall. My voice got deeper. My hair was in a slicked-back, greasy ponytail. I was rocking kitten heels. [laughter, whooping] And one Sunday, I decided to shoot my shot. I said, “Hey!” [in gruff voice] “I’d like to get in on these bells down here.” [laughter] “I’ve been playing goalie, and I’m ready to get in on the field, Coach.” “I got big hands.” “I can actually hold two of these bells with each hand. Watch.”', 'Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.', '[laughter] [in own voice] He was like, “Don’t do that.” [laughter] “So, uh, am I in or out?” He said, “Your bells are down there.” I’m like… [grunts] So I did the walk of shame to this end of the table. My grandma’s looking at me like, “What the fuck?” [laughter] You can cuss when you’re a Methodist. So we start playing our big song. They’re playing everything. I’m just standing here, waiting. I’m in my sister-wife dress. [laughter] Looking like a human napkin. [laughter] And who’s down there playing the entire song, getting all the glory of God?', '[audience joins in]', 'Becky fucking Johnson!', 'Ugh!', '[laughter] I am so bored just waiting to play one note. I start smoking a cigarette. [laughter] Drinking coffee. Finally, we get to the end of the song, and I get to pick up my big-ass bell. [grunts] I’m like, “Here we go.” I get to play the very last note. I go, dong… [fades out] [laughter] [fades back in]…ong. I’m like, “That’s it?” My grandma’s like, “That’s it?” I thought, “Oh my God.” “I have spent all this time, week after week, hours and hours, no school credit, no snacks, shit in my face.” [laughter] “I did that for the Lord, and all I got in return was one note.” And that’s why I’m gay. [laughter]', '[audience cheering]', 'I tried. [laughter] A few years ago, I looked to see what Becky F Johnson was up to. [laughter] That’s what I call her now that I’ve matured. Back then, she was unhappily married to a man, so there is a god. [laughter] And I may not go to church on Sundays anymore, but I do have my own Sunday morning ritual. [chuckles] I gotta commit to this.', '[chuckles]', '[audience laughs]', 'I make my… [snickers] [laughter] I got this.', '[audience cheering]', '[clears throat] I make myself a cup of coffee. I pull out my laptop. I go on Facebook. I re-friend my mom. [laughter] And I look to see if Becky F Johnson’s life is still a living hell. [laughter] And all I can say is…', '♪ Hallelujah ♪\\n♪ Hallelujah ♪\\n♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪\\n♪ Hallelu… ♪\\n♪…jah! ♪', '[audience cheering]', 'Ugh, that is so petty. Oh my God. [laughter] I cannot be petty. No. I have a lot to be grateful for, truly. I cannot be petty. I am so grateful that my life has unfolded the way it has. I could’ve never guessed this. I’m so grateful that I met Jax.', 'Um… She’s the best.', '[man] Whoo!', '[audience cheering]', 'Jax and I took our next big step together. Um… No, not kids. [snickers] [laughter] We actually bought a house together, uh, which was very exciting. A very adult thing to do. [cheering and applause] And Jax is the exact person you wanna do this kind of adult decision with. She’s very responsible. She asks all the right questions. She was like, you know, “How’s the roof?” Uh… “What’s the plumbing like?” “Is there mold?” I’m like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.” Um… “And, uh, I don’t know, are there ghosts?” [laughter] She looked at me like I was crazy. I’m like, “That’s a valid question.” Because when I was home, I… Ghosts were on my mind. There’s these houses in my hometown built in the 1800s, and a lot of ghost sightings have happened there. I don’t know what it is about ghosts in the 1800s. Uh, the 1800s is a very popular time for ghosts. [laughter] I’m just saying, you don’t see a lot of ghosts in Daisy Dukes.', '[laughter]', 'So people have been spotting these ghosts so much that they’ve become very casual about it, in a way that I’m not used to. So I was having lunch with my mom and her friends, and my mom said, “You know, I went to the Tates’ house a couple of weeks ago.” “I went upstairs to use the bathroom, and when I came out of the bathroom, there was Catherine.” I said, “Who’s Catherine?” She goes, “Well, she’s dead.” [laughter] “And she’s a ghost.” And all of her friends go, “Mm-hmm.” She said, “Catherine grew up in that house.” “She lived there her whole life. Never got married. Never had kids.” “She died in that house, and then when the Tates moved in, there was Catherine.” “She was in the den, the living room, the kitchen, outside of the bathroom.” “It’s just Catherine.” I said, “So Catherine just comes with the house?” Her friend goes, “Yep. I saw her a couple of weeks ago. She looked great.”', '[laughter]', '[woman whoops]', 'So hearing about Catherine made me think about the house that I grew up in. It made me think about the house Jax and I were looking at. And it was just on my mind. Now, I’ve never seen a ghost. I’m more of an energy person. It sounds very LA to be like, “I’m an empath.” [laughter] But when I was growing up, in this house that I grew up in… It was built in the 1800s. It had such a weird energy to it. I could never pinpoint what that was. Um… I just felt so unsafe in that house. I would make my dad sit outside of my bedroom until I fell asleep. And I would catch him trying to crawl out of the bedroom, like my mom in the cemetery.', '[laughter]', 'And I was like, “Dad, I’m scared!” So he didn’t sleep for a year and a half. And then he and my mom divorced. I think ’cause he just wanted to take a nap and get the hell outta that house. So as my punishment, I became my mom’s husband. Now, when I was in high school, she got that rich boyfriend I was telling you about, and she would go there on the weekends, and I would be there by myself, so scared, I slept with a knife under my bed. Not my cake-cutting knife. A different one. [laughter] And hearing about Catherine, this all comes up, and I said, “Mom, you know, the house that we grew up in, that house had such a weird energy.” My mom said, “That house was the most haunted house…” [laughter] “…I have ever lived in.” “You mean the house you left me in alone when I was a teenager?” “I had to. I was scared.” [laughter] I said, “What did you hear?” “Well, when I was there, I would hear footsteps at night, going up and down the stairs.” “You and your brothers were asleep.

She said, “But I did not wanna fool with it.” “I decided to put our house on the market.” And then she started whispering. “But I did not disclose that there was a ghost, and that house has been sold every five years ever since.” “So I believe evil still lurks within.” [laughter] Now, a couple of months ago, I was in Chicago for a show, and the night before, I was leaving a restaurant, and this man stops me, and he goes, “I have something weird to ask you.” I said, “Oh man.” [chuckles] “I am about to touch a wiener.”\", '[laughter]', '[Fortune chuckles]', '[laughter continues]', 'He said, “I think my good friend lived in your childhood home.” And he asked me the address.

That’s why I’m saying, if you’re buying a house, do not be afraid to ask about ghosts. And if the disclosures say, “The roof is from 1996, there’s new plumbing, oh, and Catherine will join you at the table,” don’t buy that house.

But, since I’ve lost all this weight, now I’m just… arrogant.', '[laughter] And by the way, thin people, that’s how we view you, as arrogant bastards. [laughter] I have lost weight. Since I’ve lost weight, I find I get two types of reactions. One group, these people, they won’t even say anything to me. They’ll just go up to my wife and ask,', '[in high voice] “Is Jim okay?”', '[laughter] [normal voice] Which sounds like concern, but I just hear judgment. ‘Cause to them, it’s more likely that I’m sick than I would ever have any self-discipline. [laughter] [in high voice] “Well, obviously, Jim’s not exercising and eating healthy.”', '“He must have cancer.”', '[laughter] [normal] That’s one group. The other group, these people will come up to me and accuse me of being on an appetite suppressant. They’re like, [in low voice] “You’re on Ozempic! Admit it! You’re on Ozempic!” [normal] And I’m not, alright? I’m on a different one. [laughter, applause] I’m on Mounjaro, which is better, right? ‘Cause it sounds like an Italian restaurant. [gravelly voice] “Welcome to Mounjaro.” “When you’re here, you’re not eatin’ anything “’cause you’re a fat ass. Yeah!”', '[laughter] [normal] Now, I understand some people are against the appetite suppressants. You know, they’re like, [nasal] “That’s cheating. It’s cheating.” [normal] I’m not playing Major League baseball. I’m just a fat guy trying to not die. [nasal] “But it’s not fair!” [normal] Yeah, neither is balding and being born with no pigmentation. [laughter] But I’ve learned to deal with it. This is an exciting time for me! I’m thin, I’m in my 30s… [audience laughing] It is crazy. Most of my adult life, I heard this constant internal monologue. [deep voice] “Jim, you gotta stop eating. Jim, you gotta control your impulses.” [normal] And now, I know all I needed was a weekly shot that killed all the passion inside of me. [audience laughing] I’ve learned so much! I now understand thin people. You don’t forget to eat.', 'You’re dead inside.', '[audience laughing] Life is about compromise! Sure, I may never feel true joy again but I can finally fit in my clothes that went out of style 30 years ago. So, it’s not a bad deal. It’s crazy. These appetite suppressants are a game changer. Here’s what’s gonna happen. All us fat people are gonna become thin. Then, we’re gonna mix in with you thin bastards.', '[scattered laughter]', 'And when you’re not looking, we’re gonna eat you.', '[loud laughter] Doesn’t matter if we’re hungry. We just like to eat. Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom! It is amazing how popular the appetite suppressants are, right? ‘Cause we live in this age of… [high voice] body positivity. Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. [normal] Oh, this drug will make you not hungry. [high voice] Give it to me or I’ll kill you. [audience laughing] I’m trying to enjoy being thin, you know, ’cause I know I’m gonna be fat again.', '[laughter]', 'I mean… this is not sustainable. [laughter] This is the drug! This is like 99% Big Pharma, 1% little Jim.', '[laughter]', 'Right? I mean…', '[applause]', 'Right? [audience cheering] Besides, I still got my fat clothes!', '¿I’m not a fool.', '[laughter] I see ’em hanging in my closet, taunting me.', '[growls]', '[laughter] [gravelly voice] “You’ll be back!” “You’ll be wearin’ me. “‘Member that time you ate an entire pizza and told your wife it never came?”', '[growls]', '[laughter] “That’s who you really are.” [normal] The drug changes your attitude towards food. I now view McDonald’s like some weird crush I had. I’m like… [scoffs], “I can’t believe I was so into you.” [audience laughing] “Meet me at midnight, and please don’t tell my wife.” Appetite suppression wasn’t even the intended use. The drug was created to help people with diabetes', 'or something stupid.', '[audience laughing] But, once it got out that there was a diabetes medicine that made people not crave donuts, every fat person was like… [low voice] “I just got diabetes.” [laughter] “Oh, ah, my diabetes is kickin’ in.” [normal] It’s not the first drug with a beneficial side effect, right? We know about Viagra, the contraceptive pill cures acne, and, of course, alcohol makes people attractive. [audience laughing] But it must be frustrating for these scientists that develop these life-changing drugs, and we fixate on a side effect. Like the people that created Viagra, they were probably so excited at that press conference. They’re like, [smart voice] “Ah, ah, well, [laughs]” “After decades of hard work, my team and I have developed this pill, “which will save the lives of men suffering from high blood pressure. “Now, uh, th-there are some minor side effects. “Uh, nausea, dizziness, uh, you get a huge boner, but…”', '[laughter] “But, most importantly, “this is a lifesaving blood pressure medicine. Any questions?” [dumb voice] “Uh, yeah, the boner part?” [laughter] “H-How long does the boner last?” [smart] “Well, th-that’s not really important, but four hours.”', '[dumb] “Jesus Christ.”', '[laughter] [smart] “Uh, I-if we could focus on the fact that this is a life-saving blood pressure medicine.” [dumb] “Uh, I got a blood pressure question.” [audience laughs] “Say I had high blood pressure, and I was going on a date to, let’s say, an orgy.”', '[laughter] “When would be the optimal time to take your boner pill… I mean, blood pressure medicine?” [audience laughing] [normal] I’m sure there’s some men in the audience who take Viagra, and by some, I mean every guy over the age of 40. [laughter] And, by the way, if you do take Viagra, you shouldn’t be embarrassed. It doesn’t mean you’re not a man. It just means the body part that defines you as a man doesn’t work. [audience laughing] You’re like a eunuch, and they’re manly! [audience member] Woo! Now, there are some men over the age of 40 who don’t take Viagra, and they’re called “celibate.” [laughter] But heck, I’ve taken Viagra! You know, just for the high blood pressure. [laughter] And the articles. [laughter, applause] The articles are amazing. [cheering] We live in this age of incredible medical and technological advancement. I know people are worried about artificial intelligence. [deep voice] “AI’s gonna take over. AI’s gonna take over.”', '[normal] I hope so.', '[laughter] I’m exhausted! I feel like my intelligence has taken me as far as I’m gonna get. [laughter] I need artificial intelligence. I was reading this article, “Will AI Take Over?” I was halfway through before I realized it wasn’t about a guy named Al.', '[audience laughing]', '“Will Al Take Over.” I thought it was about Al Roker. And his love of A1.', '[soft voice] “Jim, that’s a dumb joke.”', '[laughter] [normal] I feel like most of the technological advancements are wasted on me. You know, like, I still struggle with Wi-Fi passwords. Like, even if the password’s written down right in front of me, I’m like, “I’m probably not gonna be able to do this.” [laughter] It’s just like six or eight letters or numbers, and I feel like I’m taking the SATs. I’m like… [scoffs],', '“I-I need more time.”', '[laughter] [sighs] I shoulda slept better last night.” You ever have someone tell you a Wi-Fi password? “Oh, our Wi-Fi password, it’s super easy. “It’s just beagle, all lowercase. And the E’s a three, and the G’s an eight, and the last E’s an F.” [audience laughing] Uh, yeah, but h-how do you spell beagle? [laughter, applause] Technology is getting more complicated. I miss the simpler times. Like, remember when you used to be able to choose your own password? ‘Cause now, you have to get approval, and they always kinda give you an attitude, like, [tough voice] “Yeah, that password’s not strong enough.” [laughter] “That password’s very weak.” [normal] You’re like, “I don’t care. Just use it.” [laughter] [tough] “Nah, I don’t accept that password. Pick another one.” [normal] So, you put in a password. They’re like, [tough voice] “Yeah, that password’s too easy to guess.” [normal] That’s ’cause you just saw me type it in. [laughter] [tough] “Eh, pick another one.” Yeah, you already used that password. Pick another one.” [normal] I get writer’s block when it comes to passwords. [tough] “Pick another one.” [normal] I-I think I’m out. I already used my birthday. I don’t have any more. [laughter] The criteria for passwords is ridiculous. [tough] “Now, your password must have a capital letter, a number”, a character, a rabbit’s foot, something your mom wore at her wedding.” [audience laughing] Sometimes, they offer a password. That’s kind of humiliating. [tough voice] “Hey, dummy, you want us to just give you a password?” [laughter] [normal] Doesn’t that defeat the whole point?', '[tough] “Well, we won’t tell anyone.”', '[audience laughing] “You can trust us. We’re a faceless algorithm “created by a multinational corporation.” [laughter]', '“We won’t share your password.”', '[applause] [normal] Wh-Why… Are you winking? [tough] “No, no, no, I just got some dust in my AI.” [audience laughing] [applause, cheering] I’ve let them pick my password. You ever do that? Their password just looks like they let a cat walk on a keyboard. [laughter] Well, I coulda come up with that. [tough voice] “Yeah, but you didn’t, did you, dummy?” [normal] Well, I-I’m never gonna be able to remember that. [tough] “Well, we’ll remember it for you, dumb-ass!” You just let us know when you need it.” [normal] W-Well, can I have it now? [tough] “No!” [laughter] “We don’t know, you might be a robot.” [normal] Wait, aren’t you a robot? [tough] “Yeah, but you don’t know that. You’re so dumb.” [normal] You ever forget your password, and they make you take that quiz with the photos? [tough voice] “Hey, idiot! You see a stoplight in any of these photos?!” [laughter] [normal] For a second, you’re like, w-wait, what’s a stoplight again? I always overthink it, and I’m like, well, that pole could be connected to a stoplight. [laughter, applause] Is there partial credit? I usually just guess, but when I get it right, I’m like,', 'I’m good at the stoplight game.', '[laughter] Made it to the next level. Now, I’m allowed to check my own email. [laughter] They’re so condescending to us. [condescending voice] “You accept these cookies?”', '[normal] Cookies?', '[laughter] You know someone was like, [gravelly voice] “Just tell the idiots they’re cookies.” [normal] And we’re like, “Cookies? I like cookies.” “I’m gonna accept all the cookies. Can I accept milk with the cookies?” They present it like it’s a gift. [condescending] “Do you accept these cookies?” [dumb voice] “Well, gosh, I don’t wanna be rude.” [condescending] “The polite thing is to accept the cookies and let us track your internet activity.”', '[dumb] “As long as I get them cookies.”', '[audience laughing] We’re so accepting of all of it. You ever been in a conversation with someone where you’re talking about a vacation destination, and then, the next time you’re online, you start seeing ads for that destination?', '[audience member] Yeah. And instead of being outraged that your privacy was obviously invaded, you just book the trip. [audience laughing] “Looks like we’re going to Mexico!” [oafish laughter] I’m convinced technology’s making us delusional. The way everyone talks about going to Mars now, it’s like, [dumb voice] “We’re going to Mars!” We’re going to Mars! I can’t wait to go to Mars!” [normal] I don’t think they were talking about you. [laughter] Why do you think you’re going to Mars? You haven’t been to Minnesota. They weren’t inviting us. I’m pretty sure they were just bragging. Jeff Bezos did take his brother to outer space. I have three brothers, and I don’t even wanna buy them dinner. [laughter] I appreciate the optimism, but are we going to Mars? We put a man on the moon 54 years ago. And you know how many times we put a man on the moon after that? Zero. You know why? ‘Cause we never put a man on the moon. [audience laughing] I don’t know. I don’t know. [laughter] I don’t know, maybe we put a man on the moon. I don’t know. Maybe we’re going to Mars. Honestly, I-I don’t know how a microwave works. [laughter] Like, if someone put a gun to my head, and they’re like, “Explain the microwave!”', 'I’d be like, “Ah!”', '[laughter] “A light turns on. It rotates. “When the bell rings, your hot dog’s done.', '“Is that close?”', '[laughter] There is so much I don’t know. Most of the time, I don’t even feel like an adult. I still don’t feel comfortable buying shoes in a store. Shoes are the only clothing we let an absolute stranger put on us. You’d never go up to a salesperson, “Will you put these pants on me?”', '[laughter] Wh-Where are you going?” Yet, when we buy shoes, we become helpless. We just sit down and we’re like, [grumbles]', '“You do it.”', '[laughter] My mommy’s not here, so you have to do it.” And we know nothing about these people putting shoes on our feet. There’s no background check. All we know is they like to work with stranger’s feet. Everything they say is kinda creepy.', '[creepy voice] “How do they feel?”', '[laughter] [normal] “Excuse me?”', '[creepy] “Are they tight?”', '[laughter] [normal] “I-I beg your pardon?” [creepy] “Is that your big toe?” [laughter] [normal] “How dare you.” [creepy] “Why don’t you walk around the store, show me how cute you look in that outfit?” [normal] “Well, since you asked nicely.” [audience laughing] I’ve decided I’m gonna stop acting like I understand things I know nothing about. Like the stock market. When they talk about the stock market in the news like, [gravelly] “The stock market today, rah rah rah rah rah rah!” [normal] I normally go, “Oh, that’s interesting.” On the inside, I’m like, [dumb] “Duh!” Stock market, duh…” [normal] The saddest part of that, in college, I majored in finance.', '[laughter]', '[applause]', 'I did. I really did. [laughs] Four years, 80,000 [dumb] dollars! [laughter] [normal] I’m so glad this is what I do for a living. But, I tell you, the pandemic… the pandemic did reveal how important your occupation is to society. And let’s just say stand-up comedian, not essential.', '[laughter] Not even sential. They opened up strip clubs before they let us tell a joke. “Stay over there, funny people. Ladies, welcome back.” [audience laughing] It didn’t surprise me! There isn’t a time in history when I think I would’ve been useful. Even in an initial civilization. “We need someone to gather water, someone to build housing. Jim, how could you help?” “Uh, I can make fun of those people.” [audience laughing] It’s weird. I work in the entertainment industry, and I understand there’s a commonly held belief that people that work in show business are narcissists, that are grossly overpaid for unimportant jobs, but, believe me, it’s amazing.', '[laughter, applause] It is a sweet gig. [applause, cheering] Of course, there are some people in the entertainment industry that have unique skills that are properly compensated. I’m talking about once-in-a-generation talents, right? You know, someone like Pat Sajak. [laughter] Former host of Wheel of Fortune. Was there anything Pat Sajak couldn’t do? Think about this. He was the host of Wheel of Fortune… [inhales] [audience laughing] He was like a Renaissance man. I’m sure Pat Sajak’s a good guy. And I love Wheel of Fortune, and I’m not even 80.', '[laughter]', 'I love Wheel of Fortune. So when he announced his retirement, I was kinda bummed, you know? And he seems like a good guy, so he probably gathered everyone from the Wheel of Fortune family together, and he was like, “I’ve been doing this for a couple decades, and I’ve decided to retire.” I wish I was there ’cause if I was there, I woulda been like, “You know this isn’t a real job, right?” [laughter] “You don’t get to retire from playing Hangman.” [laughter] “The appropriate thing to do is to apologize and give back all the money.” [laughter] ‘Cause Pat Sajak had a good gig. You know how much he made a year?', '$17 million a year.', '[audience gasps] Yeah, that could buy a couple vowels. [audience laughing] 17 mill… And he didn’t even turn the letters! That was probably part of the negotiation. He’s like, “I can’t do everything!” [laughter] So, they got Vanna White. He made 17 million. Vanna made 3 million. I think we’d all agree, they both should make…', 'nothing.', '[audience laughing] [Jim laughs] When he announced his retirement, were the producers like, “Oh, no! “This is awful. Where are we gonna find someone to say, ‘It’s your turn to spin the wheel’?” [audience laughing] The good news, there is good news, Pat Sajak is continuing on as a consultant on the show. [laughter] I-I don’t know what consulting work… there is on the Wheel of Fortune. [laughs] “Uh, any new letters come out today?” [laughing, applause] “No, Pat. Still the same 26 letters.” “Alright, well, I-I’ll be in my office.”', '[audience laughing]', '[Jim muttering] I love doing stand-up comedy. Occasionally, I’ll be hired for an acting job. And sometimes, the directors of these projects will say to me like, “Jim, I think I’d like to see you clean-shaven.” And I’d be like, “I don’t think you do.”', '[laughter] I always do it, but after I shave my beard,', 'I am so disgusted with my appearance.', '[laughter] I walk around feeling like I should apologize.', 'Sorry. Sorry about this.', '[laughter] Oh, you’re eating. Sorry. And it’s not just me. It’s shocking to everyone who knows me with a beard. And they don’t hold back. They’re like, “Ew, gross! Where’s your beard?”', 'And those are just my children.', '[laughter] ‘Cause a beard is really the poor man’s facelift. Every compliment a man receives on his beard is backhanded. “I like your face with a beard.” “Oh, so it’s better covered in hair.” [laughter] “Thanks.” I feel sorry for women. Some women can’t grow a beard. [laughter] You know? What you must understand is every man who has a beard needs that beard. Every man who has a beard at one point looked in the mirror, bare-faced, and was like, “I gotta hide this.”', '[laughter] Think of all the significant historical figures who had beards probably ’cause they were insecure. Abraham Lincoln. Karl Marx.', 'Gandalf.', '[laughter] They all had beards. Jesus! Jesus had a beard. Jesus was probably walking on water, looked down, saw his reflection, was like, “Jesus!”', '[laughter, applause] [cheering] “I gotta grow a beard. I’m not gonna get any followers looking like this.” [laughter] By the way, this is how Jesus walked. [laughter] When Jesus walked on water, did he act like it was difficult?', 'Was he like, “Oh…”', '[laughter] “Can you believe it? “I’m walking on water! Take out your phone! Get this!” [laughter] Or did he walk with, like, an attitude like, “Yeah, that’s right, bitches. Look at this.” [audience laughing] “Yass, king of kings!” Of course, that was… Walking on water was one of Jesus’ miracles, but you know someone there probably just thought it was a magic trick. Someone came out, “Hey, I saw your, uh, walking on water show. “Pretty cool. I book children’s birthday parties.” [laughter] We could make a killing.” And Jesus was like, “It wasn’t a magic trick. I’m the Son of God.”', '“Interesting stage name.”', '[laughter] Anyway, here’s my card. My name’s Judas.” [laughter, applause]', 'All that’s in the Bible, everyone.', '[laughter] It’s in the Bible. There is some wild stuff in the Bible, right? Like early on, God asked Abraham to sacrifice his only son. God asked Abraham to kill his only son. And Abraham, like most fathers, said, “Alright, I’ll do it.”', '[audience laughing] In his defense, we don’t know what Abraham was doing right before God asked him. Maybe Abraham was going through bills and was like, “Wh-who spent 500 shekels on Nintendo?” [laughter, applause] And then right at that moment, God was like, “Abraham, I want you to sacrifice your only son.”', 'Abraham’s like, “Gladly!”', '[laughter] Can it be a strangle sacrifice?” God was communicating with Abraham from Heaven. I don’t know if he was yelling down. Did anyone overhear the conversation? Like, was there anyone up there in Heaven? Was Jesus up in Heaven? Was God like, “Abraham, I want you to sacrifice your only son!” And Jesus was like, “Dad, what the hell are you doing?!” [laughter] God was like, “Uh, we’ve been through this before.', '“Just mind your own business.”', '[laughter] “Pay no attention to that bearded hippie! “Abraham, I’d like you to sacrifice your only son.” Jesus was like, “Dad, you can’t ask Abraham to sacrifice his only son!” And God was like, “Uh, that gives me an idea.” [groaning, laughter] “Jesus, I’d like you to go down to Earth, and, uh, tell the humans I’m your dad.” And Jesus is like, “If I go down there, if I tell the humans you’re my dad”, they might get angry. They might hurt me.”', 'And God’s like, [sarcastic] “No…”', '[laughter] Why would they do that? They seem so nice down there.” Jesus is like, “Alright, if I go down there and they start to hurt me”, you’ll stop ’em.” And God’s like, “Yeah, definitely. Probably, maybe.', '[audience laughing]', '“Yeah…” Abraham was rewarded for his loyalty, right? He got to live to the age of 175. He died when he was 175, which is cool.', 'But, those last 90 years…', '[laughter] Yikes, right? Do you think when they were first writing down the Bible, anyone was like, “Wait, do we really wanna put 175? “I mean, we want people to read this, right?” [laughter] “Why don’t we just put 75? “You know, that’s a good run. I could see it. “Mediterranean diet. That could happen.', '[laughter]', '“You know?” 175. If you met someone today, and they’re like, “My grandpa lived to 175,” you’d be like, “You’re mentally ill.”', '[laughter] Could you imagine if you lived to 175? You’re like, “Yeah, I retired at 60.” “Had no idea I had another 115 years to go.” [laughter] “How much pickleball am I supposed to play?”', '[cheering, applause]', 'Like, geez.', '[cheering, applause]', 'Thank you. Thank you. That was Abraham’s reward. He got to live to 175. He also is a founding figure of not just one religion, but three religions, right? Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which is amazing. You know what’s even more amazing? Those three religions, best buddies. [audience laughing] They get along great, no problems. Does Abraham feel any responsibility? Does he ever look down from Heaven, like, “Yikes!” [laughter] “I-I didn’t do that…” God used to be so much more involved. God was so hands-on. Talking to Abraham, floods, plagues. Now, He’s just like, “You know what?” “Just put Jesus’ face on a piece of toast.”', '[audience laughing]', '[sighs] “I just can’t even, you know?” “No, if they’re not gonna listen, I’m not gonna try!” [laughter] I guess the point I’m trying to make is I’m a Christian. [laughter] And the reason I say that is to make you feel uncomfortable. ‘Cause when non-Christians hear me say I’m a Christian, they think, “Oh, no.” And when Christians hear me say I’m a Christian, they think, “Oh, no.”', '[laughter] So, it’s a way to bring the crowd together. [applause, laughter] [applause, cheering] Thank you so much for coming out, by the way.', 'I do appreciate it.', '[cheering]', 'Yeah. Thank you.', '[applause] Um… I’m so grateful that I can travel around doing stand-up comedy, but I do need you to know that my life at home is horrible. [laughter] I have five children. It’s like hell. My life at home is actually the opposite of this experience. Like, when I came out, you guys greeted me with applause.', 'At home, I’m not even acknowledged.', '[laughter] And I’m not suggesting parents should be greeted with applause. That’s not enough. [laughter, cheering] I think parents should receive a standing ovation.', 'There should be an announcer.', '[cheering] “Please welcome, the only reason you’re alive.”', '[applause, laughter]', 'Right? [cheering] ‘Cause, parenting is an impossible task! It’s too hard! The expectations are too high. In baseball, if I have a .300 average, if I get a hit three times outta 10, I’m good. Yet, if I hit my kid once… [audience laughing] I’m bad at it? Children, children are the only thing we remove from the human body, and then keep. [audience laughing] You know? [applause, cheering] You never hear someone say, “That’s my appendix. That’s my son.', '“Neither of ’em work.”', '[audience laughing] I do believe parents, we deserve this pain. We deserve the pain. The audacity, the audacity to think you’re equipped to be a parent. And we just arrogantly jump into this responsibility. We’re just like, “Yeah, yeah, I lose my phone once a day.” [laughter] “I could take care of a baby.” [laughter] “Can you call my baby?” “Call my baby!” Now, I’m aware not everyone here is a parent. You know, you have a child, you become a parent. You never have a child, you just remain happy. [audience laughing] Not everyone wants to be a parent. Some choose to not have children, and I respect that. I do. But, I don’t think those people should be considered adults. [laughter] How are they different from giant toddlers? What stress is keeping them awake at night? [whiny voice] “Where am I gonna go for brunch?” [laughter] If you’re over the age of 30, and the biggest problem in your life is your Wi-Fi connection, you’re not an adult.', '[laughter] If you’ve never been out, discovered a stain, and privately prayed that it was chocolate…', '[laughter, applause] You’re not an adult. If you haven’t bragged to your spouse or partner that you haven’t had time to shower for three days, you’re not an adult. And you might be a redneck. [laughter, applause] There’s no comparison. One has a rich, fulfilling life, and the other is a parent.', '[laughter] There should be a whole other classification. Oh, you’re over 30, no kids? You’re a junior adult. How was brunch? [laughter] By the way, can we admit brunch was just the rationalization of some alcoholic?', '[laughter] Someone’s like, “You can’t drink alcohol at breakfast.” [slurred] “It’s not breakfast.”', '“It’s brunch.”', '[laughter, applause] “What?” [slurred] “It’s breakfast. It’s lunch. It’s… Happy birthday!” [laughter, applause] Everything about brunch is ridiculous.', 'You obviously slept through breakfast.', '[laughter] And now, you’re demanding French toast at 1:00 p.m. while you get loaded on mimosas.', '[laughter] Tell me the mimosa wasn’t the brainchild of a drunk? [slurred] “Do you have fresh-squeezed orange juice? “You do? Pour in some champagne.” [laughter] “We’ll call it a m…mosa.”', '[laughter] [normal] Mimosa even sounds like that unreliable coworker. “Mimosa, where’s the quarterly report?”', '[slurred] “I’m working on it!”', '[laughter] “Who wants to go get linner?” “It’s lunch. It’s dinner. It’s… happy birthday!” I’m sensitive to the fact some people physically can’t have children, but there is adoption. And we learn from an early age through movies like Annie and Oliver that there are children out there that need parents, and many of those kids can sing and dance. [laughter] So, have a heart. Support the arts, people. [audience laughing] I certainly don’t care if someone has kids. I think it’s weird some of the pressure we put on people. Some of the things we say, like people go, [snide voice] “Well, who’s gonna take care of you in your old age?” “Who’s gonna take care of you in your old age?” And I’m like, “Well, not my children.” [laughter] Let me understand the logic here. My kids, who’ve done nothing but bleed me dry… are suddenly gonna wake up and take care of me? That feels like a gamble.', '[audience laughing]', 'By the way, I’m not worried about my kids putting me in an old folks home. They’re not that resourceful. “I gotta fill out forms? Just stick him in the garage.” [laughter, applause] If you don’t have kids, here’s a story which embodies the joy of parenting. I have five children, so I try to do one-on-one time with each of them. That way, I know I’ve met them all. [laughter] Last February, I took my then 10-year-old son for a walk. We walked our dog, and before we left, I said, “Hey, it’s pretty cold out there. You might wanna grab a coat.” He’s like, [angry voice] “I’m not wearing a coat! That’s stupid! You can’t make me!” [normal] I was like, “Fine, you don’t have to wear a coat.” So we went for the walk and as we turned to walk back, he looked at me and asked, [sad voice] “Dad, can I have your coat?” [laughter] [normal] And I didn’t hesitate, right? Because being a parent is like being a psychic who’s constantly correct, but always ignored. [laughter, applause] Right? [applause, cheering] All day, every day, parents are like, “Let me look into my crystal ball. Ooh, it’s pretty cold out there. You might wanna grab a coat.”', '[angry] “You’re fat.”', '[laughter] [normal] “Oh, if you stay up late, you may be tired in the morning.” [angry] “You’re bald.” [normal] “Ooh, I foresee economic hardship when I kick you out of this house.”', '[laughter] It’s not their fault. Children don’t understand consequences. Parents understand consequences.', 'They’re called children.', '[laughter] Children are walking, talking consequences. That’s why every parent occasionally looks at their kid and thinks, “I know I shouldn’t have gotten wasted that night.” [laughter] It is wild how different the childhood my kids are having from the one I had. Like, I remember when I was 10 years old, my mom used to send me on errands. I remember one time, she sent me to the grocery store with very specific instructions. I walked a mile and a half to the grocery store, and I did what I was told. I went right up to the cashier, handed her $10 and said, “My mom sent me here to buy a carton of cigarettes.', '“Merit Ultra Lights.”', '[laughter] The cashier looked at me and asked, “How old are you?” And I said, “I’m 10 years old.” She said, “You’re a good boy.” [laughter, applause] She complimented me, gave me the cigarettes and my change, and I walked home, smoking the entire way. [applause] We used to send children on errands alone. But now, after 25 years of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, we don’t feel safe having them open a refrigerator. I used to like the independence, you know? I mean, I was definitely scared here and there. I was mostly afraid of grown-ups. Grown-ups were just these evil giants that somehow all knew each other. [gravelly voice] “I know your father.” [audience laughing] [normal] “How?” [creepy voice] “I held you as a baby.”', '[normal] “Why?”', '[laughter] My friends growing up were afraid of my dad. You know? My, my childhood best friend, to this day, is still afraid of my dad.', 'My dad’s been dead for 30 years.', '[laughter] My kids, their friends, they view me as an Uber driver. And they’ve requested a silent ride. [audience laughing] [snarky voice] “Can we turn down the music, Jim?”', '[normal] I’ll kill you.', '[audience laughing] I mean… I know your parents. I’ll kill them, too. [audience laughing] Parenting is about sacrifice, right? Some big, some small. Do you know how many horrible kids’ movies I’ve seen?', 'In the theater?', '[laughter] I’ve voluntarily driven, purchased multiple tickets, and sat through absolute garbage. Objectively bad movies. Like, I didn’t need to read a review. I didn’t need to watch a trailer. Nobody asks themselves like, “I wonder if The Smurfs is a good film.” [laughter] It’s not! They tried to warn us by calling it The Smurfs! I have five children. I’ve been going to horrible kids’ movies for 15 years. A decade and a half of torture. And the hardest part, the self-censorship. ‘Cause after you sit through a movie like Trolls or My Pretty Pony, if you’re a normal adult, you need to turn to someone and go, “Well, that was horseshit.”', '[laughter] You know? But you can’t say that to an 8-year-old! So, you just ask, [happy voice] “Hey, what’d you think?” Yeah, I hope they make another one, too!” [laughter] [normal] And they do. They make five more. And you sit through each of them, just thinking about alcohol. [laughter] My father, my father would’ve never sat through a horrible kids’ movie. On the rare occasion my dad took us to a movie, we were never consulted!', '[laughter] We didn’t know what movie we were gonna see. He didn’t know what movie we were gonna see! It was understood that when we got to the theater, he was gonna pick a movie, buy tickets, and we were gonna walk in immediately. Didn’t matter when the movie started, that was the beginning of the movie for us. We’d walk into the dark theater, sit down, watch the last third of a movie…', '[laughter] The lights would turn on, people would leave, we’d just sit there trying to figure out what the hell we just saw. We might ask each other like, “How do you think the movie starts?” [laughter] Then a new crowd would come in. The lights would turn off. The movie would start. We’d watch to a certain point. Then, my dad would just stand up and leave. [laughter] And we’d follow him out. That’s how we saw movies as a family! And I kinda miss it. Often, it felt like we were just helping my dad establish an alibi. [laughter] “I couldn’t have killed that drifter. I was at the movies with my kids.” I do wish we could’ve seen The Sound of Music as a family with my father. You know, just halfway through The Sound of Music, my father stands up, starts to leave, followed by his six blonde children. [laughter, applause] Everyone in the theater’s like, “Wow, that family didn’t like it when Captain von Trapp tore up that Nazi flag at all.” [audience laughing] That joke was even funnier when everyone hated Nazis.', '[audience cheering]', 'Right? [applause] I know I complain a lot about my kids, but they’ve ruined my life. [laughter] I love them, but they treat me horribly! And people without kids are always like, “I’d never let my kids treat me horribly.”', 'Oh yeah, you would.', '[laughter] You know what the alternative is? Jail. [laughter] So you let them treat you horribly, and you just think about alcohol. I was thinking if I told a therapist how my kids treat me, but I didn’t say they were my children, if I was like, “Yeah, I live with these five people. They eat all my food. “They spend all my money, and when I ask them to do anything, they just yell at me.”', '[laughter] Any therapist, any therapist would be like, “You should move out.”', '[laughter] You’re the victim of abuse.” I love them, and I know they love me. I mean, even though when my 18-year-old son does say, “I love you,” it does sound like he’s auditioning for an acting part he really doesn’t want. [lethargic voice] “Love you, Dad.” [normal] “Okay, that was a good start. Let’s try it again.” [laughter] “Uh, this time, I wanna hear some more affection, maybe sense a relationship.”', '[lethargic] “Love you, Dad.”', '[laughter] [normal] “Alright, well, we’ll let you know. Thanks for coming in.”', '[audience laughing]', 'Alright… [applause, cheering] Parenting is hard, and it gets progressively harder. That’s what they don’t tell you when you have a baby. I guess it would be inappropriate. “Congratulations. It’s gonna get really hard.” [laughter] So, as a new parent, you have to figure it out on your own. And a baby, a newborn, they’re so fragile, they’re so dependent. You help them burp. The new parent thinks, “Oh, this must be the hard part. This is the hard part.”', 'Not the hard part.', '[laughter] Then the child becomes a toddler. It’s chaos. They’re screaming in grocery stores. You’re literally stopping them from accidentally killing themselves. The parent thinks, “Oh, this is the hard part. This is the hard part.”', 'Not the hard part.', '[laughter] Then, the child becomes a teenager, and the parents are like, “Oh, this whole thing was a mistake.” [laughter, applause] “We shouldn’t have done this.”', '[audience cheering]', '[Jim sighs] Parenting is the only thing you can do for 13 years, 13 years, and then suddenly, you’re really bad at it. [audience laughing] It’s God’s cruelest joke ’cause you know he’s sitting up there, just watching. He’s like… [maniacal laughter] “They think they’re pretty good at the parenting thing, huh?', '“Watch this.”', '[laughter] “Cue the hormones!” [maniacal laughter] This reminds me of when Jesus was a teenager. You know, he used to vape. [applause, laughter] Anyone here have a teenager? [applause, cheering] Ooh… I love that forced enthusiasm. [laughter] The best is when empty nesters talk about the teenage years ’cause they always sound like they’re describing a hurricane. “My wife and I thought we were prepared. We lost everything.” [audience laughing] That’s why hurricanes are named after teenagers. Teenagers do make you realize parenting’s a skill, but it’s mostly luck, right? ‘Cause there are easy teenagers, and there are difficult teenagers. And if you have an easy teenager, that doesn’t mean you’re good at parenting. It just means God didn’t think you could handle a hard one. [audience laughing] Parenting teenagers has made me a better comedian.', 'No, that’s… that’s not it.', '[laughter] A bitter comedian! [laughter] I know that sounds negative, but it is almost sad when a kid becomes a teenager, right? ‘Cause you have this cute 12-year-old, and then boom, they become Satan. [laughter] You can literally witness the curiosity and wonder transform into body odor and poor judgment. [laughter] And then, you, the parent, you’re supposed to learn how to communicate with them! My wife emails me articles, “How to talk to your teenager.” I’m like, “Delete.”', '[audience laughing]', '[applause, cheering]', 'She’s always like, [whiny] “How do you expect to communicate with our teenagers?” [normal] I’m gonna try English. [audience laughing] They do hear things differently. Like, if I tell my 14-year-old daughter, “Hurry up, we’re running late,” she hears,', '“I’m gonna kill you.”', '[laughter] But then, we talk it through and come to an agreement that I’m a horrible person.', '[laughter] And then, I go drink alcohol. Do you ever notice in commercials for alcohol, people are always laughing and having a good time? I’d just like to see one print ad that shows some expressionless dad sitting alone at a kitchen table with a bottle of booze. [audience laughing] [applause, cheering] The tagline would be like, “Bourbon, ’cause you’re trapped and suicide’s off the table.” [audience laughing] Is that too negative? That’s too negative. [Jim laughs] There are teenagers in the audience like, “Why the hell am I here?” [audience laughing] “I had no idea this guy was such a colossal dick.” [laughter] We should acknowledge being a teenager today is the hardest it’s been in generations. What these teenagers have to deal with, it’s insane.', '[applause, cheering]', 'Right? Social media, the prevalence of drugs, pornography’s everywhere. I guess what I’m saying is I wish I was a teenager.', '[laughter] I had to walk a mile and a half for cigarettes. I think the greatest irony of teenagers is that they’re embarrassed of their parents. It’s like, “Oh, you’re embarrassed of me?” [audience laughing] “Have you looked in the mirror?” Each of my teenagers has come up to me at different points and been like, “Hey, can you act like you don’t know me?” [laughter] We can make that permanent. [applause, laughter] It’s amazing how consistent the theme of embarrassment is throughout parenting, right? ‘Cause when your kids are little, they’re constantly embarrassing you, right? Some of the things they say or scream, they’re like, [whiny] “Why is that guy so fat?” [laughter] “Is that woman a witch?” [sighs]', '“Jews! Jews!”', '[laughter] “It’s juice!” [laughter] “Juice!', '“Please say juice.”', '[laughing, applause] That actually happened to me. I was in a Whole Foods in New York City… [audience groaning] And my two blonde children were screaming for Jews. [laughter] They were demanding Jews in a way that would lead you to believe they’ve been delivered Jews before. [laughter] “Jews, Jews.” “Juice! Juice!', '“For the love of Jesus, please say juice.”', '[laughter] [nervous laugh] “They love juice.”', '“Not Jews. I mean, they love Jews, too!”', '[laughter] “They get that from me. I’m a Jew lover. [nervous laugh]', '“Love me some Jews.”', '[applause] Your kids consistently embarrass you. And then one day, out of nowhere, you’re the biggest source of humiliation in their life! [laughter] They don’t tell you when that happens, and there are strict rules that you only learn about when you break them. [laughter] I was at dinner recently, and my 14-year-old daughter was like, [whiny] “And then, Dad walked into the high school.” [audience laughing] [normal] My wife was like, “Honey, you didn’t go into the school, did you?” [laughter] “But, but… i-it was cold out.”', '“Wh-What planet are we on?”', '[audience laughing] We have three teenagers plus a 12-year-old plus an 11-year-old.', 'Forecast, not great.', '[laughter] Definitely hurricane season. And I freely admit my wife has it harder, much harder, but this whole thing is kind of her fault. These children didn’t come outta my body.', 'In a way, they’re not even my kids.', '[laughter] Now, I don’t wanna sound like a conspiracy theorist, but that whole sperm fertilizing the egg thing? I’ve never seen that in person. [laughter] I’ve seen a simulation of it. You know, how you might stage a landing on the moon? [laughter] Men should be suspicious. Women discover they’re gonna become a parent.', 'Men are told.', '[laughter] Men find out they’re gonna be a father the same way they learn they have a terminal illness.', '[laughter] Someone comes up and goes, “You should sit down.” And men have a similar response. [hoarse voice] “How much time do I got?” [applause, laughter] Of course, with paternity tests, now we can scientifically prove who the father is, but for most of human existence, the guy just had to believe what he was told. [high voice] “I’m pregnant. You’re the father.” [normal] “I haven’t been home for two years.” [laughter] [high voice] “It’s a miracle.” [normal] Occasionally, you’ll hear about a paternity test. You never hear about a maternity test though. [audience laughing] How do we really know who the mother is? “Uh, the child came out of my body.” Well then, you shouldn’t be afraid to take a test. [laughter] Okay, Jim, that’s the dumbest joke of the night. That one? [scoffs] Obviously, paternity tests exist because some men are garbage. And I tell you, as the father of five, when I hear about these men that abandon their children, I am so filled with jealousy. [laughter] There’s no excuse. [laughs] There’s no excuse. But, nothing prepares a man for parenthood. Like, a woman goes through a whole physiological change. Not only growing the baby, but there’s morning sickness, a nesting instinct takes over. For a guy during the entire pregnancy, they feel the same, worthless.', '[laughter] Which, in a way, prepares them for fatherhood. Right? I think fathers are generally under-appreciated. Who would agree with me, right?', '[men clap, cheer]', 'Listen to these divorced dads! Right? Obviously, the mom is the hero of the story, right? [women clap, cheer] When someone becomes famous, they buy their mom a house. They don’t even invite the dad to live there. [laughter] Often, it’s easier to understand a mother’s contribution. I see it in my family. My children see, on a daily basis, what my wife does for them. Yet, when I travel the country, eating steak and complaining about my kids… [laughter] Do I get credit? I sure don’t. Being a dad is like being a backup quarterback in the NFL. You’re on the team, but you’re not the star. And on those rare occasions you’re brought into the game, people are nervous, you know?', '[laughter] [applause]', 'Oh, thank you.', '[cheering] It’s amazing how the status of father has changed in our society. You know, in the 1950s, there was a television show called Father Knows Best. Father Knows Best. And they… and they weren’t being ironic. They weren’t like, [condescending] “Wouldn’t it be hysterical if a dad knew anything?” [laughter] [normal] They were sincere ’cause at that time, the prevailing belief was that a father did know best. Not only would they never do that show today, if you gave someone the prompt, “Father knows,” no one would say, “best.”', '[laughter] If you’re like, “Father knows…” “Uh, how to make an old fashioned? I don’t know.” [laughter] Even if you went up to a dad, you’re like, “Father knows…” “Uh, when to say… I d… I don’t know, ask my wife. “What the hell do you want me to say? I’m not yelling! You’re yelling!” [laughter] “You want an old fashioned? Alright, I’ll make you an old fashioned.” [grunting] I’m lucky. My wife, my starting quarterback, is amazing. Uh, we’ve been married for 20 years. Can you believe that? Twenty years. [applause, cheering] Twenty years. And, uh, we have a great marriage, from what you know. [laughter] ‘Cause you never really know what’s going on in someone else’s marriage, right? You might think you do, but you… When you hear about a divorce, you’re always surprised. Sometimes, you realize it was all an act, right? Like, there, there should be awards. “The nominees for best performance in an unhappy marriage are…” [laughter] “Oh, she was good. She was very good. I had no idea she despised him.” No, my wife is amazing, or her performance is amazing.', '[laughter] No, my wife… And she does everything. And she’s done that since the start of our marriage. She planned our whole wedding. She’s very Catholic, so she picked out every reading in, in the whole service. And I remember watching my brother-in-law read 1 Corinthians. If you don’t know, that’s the, [whiny] “Love is patient.” Love is kind. Love is… [gibberish].”', '[normal] That’s how it sounded to me.', '[audience laughing] But, I remember it so vividly because it ends with, “Love doesn’t keep a record.” And I tell you, after 20 years of marriage, my wife has done one thing.', 'Keep a record…', '[laughter, applause] Of every mistake I’ve ever made. She has receipts going back to our first date. She brings up stuff before we even met. [nasal] “I remember seeing you in the neighborhood. You looked so arrogant.” [laughter] [normal] She remembers everything! I can’t tell you what happened a half hour ago. It’s not fair. [laughs] I’ll be like, “Hey, I thought we agreed.” “What did I say exactly?” [audience laughing] “You win.” Her memory is so good. I’m convinced she heard a different 1 Corinthians. “Love does keep a record. Love is slightly annoyed. “Love doesn’t appreciate you coming back from being out of town [inhales] And second-guessing decisions I’ve made. It undermines me. Amen.” [laughter] [applause, cheering] She’s pretty amazing. I have no complaints.', 'Well, if there was one complaint…', '[laughter] Not a complaint, an observation. My wife’s not a fan of our dog. Well, she’s indifferent to our dog. But, you know, to a dog lover, people that are indifferent to dogs seem like sociopaths. [laughing, applause] It’s like, “You don’t love dogs? Who hurt you?” There’s no excuse to not love dogs! I mean, my wife’s allergic. That’s one excuse. [laughter] But our dog is so sweet and will not leave my wife alone. Whenever my wife enters the room, the dog climbs all over her, sneezing. And as my wife pushes the dog away, so that she can breathe, there’s always part of me that thinks, “Hey, don’t be mean to my dog.” [laughter] Now, you may be wondering, “If your wife’s allergic, “why do you even have a dog? Did you get the dog, and then discover your wife’s allergic?”', 'No.', '[laughter] I’ve known my wife’s allergic for 20 years, and I never expected us to get a dog. I never did. I mean, we live in an apartment in New York City. We have five children. I travel constantly. We’re not getting a dog. But then, the pandemic happened, and all the reasons to not get a dog seemed to disappear. We rented a house in the suburbs with a big yard. I stopped traveling. My wife’s allergies didn’t change. [audience laughing] Mainly, my kids started begging for a dog. “Can we get a dog? Can we get a dog?” It was like on a daily basis. So, I told my wife, I’m like, “Let me handle this.” So, I called a family meeting, and I stood next to my wife, and I said, “Once and for all”, “your mother is allergic to dogs. When she’s around dogs, she feels physically ill.” And my youngest, he’s so sweet. He was like, [high voice] “Can’t Mom just get a shot in her stomach?” [laughter] He reminds me of myself. So, I turned to my wife, and I was like, “Can’t you just get a shot in your stomach?” She was like, “What the hell are you doing?” I was like, “I don’t know why you’re mad at me. He’s the one who asked.”', '[audience laughing]', '[Jim laughs] She didn’t think it was funny. And I could see that we weren’t getting anywhere, so I proposed a compromise. I was like, “What if we fostered a dog?” “The dog would only live with us until a permanent home was found, or… my wife died.”', '[audience laughing] She really didn’t think that was funny and left the room. But, the next day, outta nowhere, she was like, “Alright, fine, we can foster a dog, but we’re not keeping it.” And I was like, “We’re not keeping it.” So I went and I got this dog, and I brought it home. And the most incredible thing happened. Not only did my children fall in love with this dog, but slowly, over time, and being occasionally exposed to the dog, my wife’s allergies… didn’t change.', '[audience laughing] But, she witnessed how much my children loved the dog. So, she decided we could keep the dog. She made that sacrifice for my family, and it made me realize I don’t get enough credit. [audience laughing] I don’t bring this up a lot, but I think I’m allergic to children. [laughter] And we got five of those. You know, we only got one dog, and it’s not a competition, but I win. [laughter] After we had the dog for like a month, my wife was feeling sluggish. We thought she had COVID. She kept testing negative. So, she, she went to the doctor, and they took a blood test, and they discovered she had contracted Lyme disease. [audience gasps] Which is something you get from a tick, which is something that dogs foster. [laughter] She told me this over the phone, and I was like, “Oh, she’s gonna kill me.”', '[laughter] She is. She’s gonna kill me, and she has every right to kill me.” And I just braced myself as she drove home. But, when she got in the house, she very calmly walked up to me, and she goes, “Well I have Lyme disease because of that dog. What do you have to say for yourself?” And I said the only thing I could say, I was like, “Well, you’re the one who wanted the dog.” [audience laughing] [applause] And she said… She said, “Don’t gaslight me.” And I was like, “I’ve never heard that term before.”', '[laughter] She was like, “You’ve never heard of gaslighting?” And I was like, “I don’t think anyone on this planet has heard of gaslighting. You might be going crazy.” [audience laughing] Now, I’m sensing some tension in the room. [laughs] What you have to understand is that the Lyme disease is gone. She’s fine. And by the way, also, my wife is the strongest person I’ve ever met. Those five children, she gave birth to each of those children in our apartment. No drugs. She had Lyme disease. It’s gone. She’s fine. Before that, she had a brain tumor. It’s gone. She’s fine. And I asked her at one point, I go, “What’s been the biggest challenge you’ve encountered?” And she said, “Being married to you.” [laughter, applause] [cheering] And I have to tell you, I take pride in that.', '[laughter] Alright, you guys have been a delight.

The money, all right? There’s money in this room. But there’s also not money in this room. [audience laughs] That’s the Bay. You’re not as progressive as you think you are, Bay Area. In this room right now, there’s a guy who owns three homes. And he’s sitting directly next to a dude who only owns three hoodies. [audience laughs] And one of y’all’s getting stabbed tonight. It’s probably the landlord.', '[laughs]', '[audience laughs]', 'Because it’s all here. I can see it. It’s all here. Whoo-hoo. We got it all here. We got the one percent, right? We got, like, Palo Alto, Los Altos. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? Stanford area, right? Yeah, the one percent. Yeah! Yes. You definitely drive a Tesla. I can see it. [audience laughs] Yeah, the one percent right here, eh? Then way the fuck back there, we have the 99% just… [audience cheering] Hayward, Richmond, East Oakland. Yeah! Yeah, this is your landlord! Kill him! Kill him! Why does he keep raising the rent? [laughs] This is why I had to do it in the Bay. Even when you’re rich in the Bay, you’re poor. [audience laughs] You could be a Google engineer making 900 grand a year, and you have to live in a trap house in East Oakland, and you’re on OnlyFans making them cheeks clap just so you can pay rent. Just so you can pay this uncle rent. Dude, we have Zillow.com, and we’re still a functioning society. How? Do you know what Zillow.com is? Zillow.com is a website where you can type in the address of someone you’re jealous of… [audience laughs] and you can see their mortgage payment. [audience laughs] Dude, we’re never gonna own. Millennials, Gen Z, y’all are never, never gonna own homes.', 'And it’s our fault.', '[woman] Yup. We fumbled the bag. Because for years we were praying to God. “God, please fix the housing crisis.” “Please open up the supply of available homes in this country.” And then, in March of 2020, God was like, “Here.” [audience laughs] “Here’s a disease that specifically kills old people.” [audience laughs] And we were like, “No!” “Wear a mask!” “Save Grandma!” “Stop the spread!” Let it spread. [audience laughs] Let God cook. [audience laughing and cheering] Yeah, we’re idiots, Californians. We’re fucking idiots. Look at all the states that were anti-mask. Plenty of homes. [audience laughs] Nevada, Georgia, Florida. Plenty of homes. Plenty of dead grandmas. These people accept God’s blessings. [audience laughs] All I’m saying is if you were pro-mask, you cannot complain about housing prices. What do you want? You wanna save Grandma or you want a backyard? You can’t have both. [audience laughs] Dude, the same problem with the housing market, these fucking Boomers will not die, is the same problem with the US government.', 'These fucking Boomers will not die.', '[audience cheers]', 'Our entire government is just a mass nursing home-dot-gov. I mean, it’s fucking… Uncle, why are you clapping? That’s you. You’re like, “Yeah!” What? Even he’s like, “They’re too old, man!” [audience laughs] This is gonna come out right before the election. People are arguing about the president. Fucking zoom out. Look at Congress. There’s 535 members of Congress, and they’re all old as fuck. Dude, Nancy Pelosi is 84 years old. [audience murmuring] Is anyone here 84 years old? [audience laughs] Yeah, of course not! Yes, it’s 7:00 p.m. Of course not! It’s seven o’clock. You’re asleep. Of course you’re not here. Why would you be here? Why the fuck would you be here? People are like, “Oh, Hasan, you’re really ageist.” “That really age…” Yeah, I am capital-A ageist. [audience laughs] Write about it. Substack it. Make it the headline. “I am age…” Age matters. Ask Drake. [audience exclaims] It is a pertinent detail. Hey! Hey! Hey! I thought we were the science people. Progressives, “Trust the science.” “Believe the science. Don’t let your kids on social media.” “The synapses in their brain…” “The synapses in their brain are still develo…” “The synapses.” Senator Chuck Grassley is 90 years old. [audience laughs] What do you think the synapse…? What… [audience cheering] He has the MRI brain scan of an NFL quarterback. It’s fucking applesauce up there. Why don’t we treat our politicians the same way we treat our professional athletes? Here in America, the moment you lose just a little bit of edge as an athlete, we fucking turn on you. [audience laughs] Within two years. Even the GOATs, right? Michael Jordan with the Wizards. Kobe with the Achilles. Look at the way that we treated Tom Brady. The moment Tom Brady couldn’t give us an eighth Super Bowl, we were like, “Brady, you got two more years.” This motherfucker lost to the Rams, right? “One more year, Brady.” Then this motherfucker lost to the Cowboys. “Bring this old geezer to the back of the shed.” “Let’s put two bullets into his skull.” “Let’s tear apart his marriage. Let’s ridicule his children.” “Let’s roast his ass on Netflix in 190 countries and just piss all over his legacy.” Just, “Tudum!”', '[audience whooping]', '[laughs] Now look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [audience exclaims] Eighty-seven years old! Ruth Bader Ginsburg battled cancer, five times in the last 20 years of her life. And Barack Obama was like, “Please, Ruth, for the love of God, retire so I can replace you.” And this geriatric coffin-dodger was like, “Fuck you, Barry.” [audience laughs] “I’ll see you in fucking hell.” [audience laughs] And every progressive was like, “Yas, queen!” “Notorious RBG.” If we treated Ruth Bader Ginsburg the same way we treated Tom Brady, abortion would still be legal in all 50 states. [audience cheering and whooping] You know what’s interesting? Depending on where I do that joke, the audience reacts very differently. Sometimes when I do that joke, Trump fans get mad at me. Sometimes Biden fans get mad at me. But here’s my thing. Why are you a fan? [audience laughs] You know? Like, you’re like a fan of a president. You have like a T-shirt. You have like a poster on the wall. Like, “This is my guy!” “He’s my…” Like, being a fan of a politician is like being a fan of a national bank. [audience laughs] Imagine walking through downtown San Jose and seeing some loser with a T-shirt. Just like, “Citibank!” You see another guy, “No, fuck you, bro! Wells Fargo!”', '[audience laughs]', '“Do you wanna be on the right side of history?” It’s like, dude, I’ve banked with both. They will disappoint you for different reasons. Because I’ve met these people. I’ve met all of them. I’m part of the Illuminati. [audience laughs] They all reach out to me during election season. They think I’m the brown whisperer. [audience laughs] They think if we have lunch, I’ll blow the conch. Know what I mean? I’ll be like… [imitates blowing conch shell] “Browns… we must vote for Andrew Yang!” [audience laughs and applauds] No, why are you clap… No, don’t clap! They’re all fucking insane. I am 38 years old. This will be the tenth presidential cycle of my lifetime. Every president in my lifetime goes into office a sociopath and then leaves a war criminal. [whoops] Because they all want one thing. You know what they want? They want the ring. Ooh, they want the ring of power. They want it. They want it more than marriage, more than family. More than their kids. Look at Hillary Clinton. Look at how bad Hillary Clinton wanted to be president. Hillary Clinton wanted to be president so bad, she was willing to sit in the same office… [audience exclaiming] Not a different office. Not a replica House of Cards office. The Oval Office. That is sociopathic ambition. That’s why there’s so many Indians in politics. [audience laughs] Bro, we got sociopathic ambition. In one generation, look how many Indians there are in politics, running the highest offices around the world. One generation. Rishi Sunak. Nikki Haley. Vivek Ramaswamy. Half of Kamala Harris when she wants our vote. We are fucking killing it!', '[audience cheering]', '[Hasan laughs] Dude… Look at the Republican Party. There are more Indians in the Republican Party than my bachelor party. [audience laughs] And right now it’s wild. Y’all, more minorities with melanin, ooh, joining the hard-R Republicans. It’s happening more than ever. And all my white NPR tote-bag friends, it fries their brain. They’re like, “What the fuck is going on?” “Why are all these Mexicans voting for Donald Trump?” [audience laughs] “He calls them rapists!” I’m like, “Chelsea… do you know what I would let a politician call me if I could pay zero percent federal income tax?” [audience laughs] “I would let you body-cavity search me at every airport.” “Spit in my mouth and call me a terrorist.” [imitates spitting] Daddy wants to pay zero-percent FICA. That’s the thing Caucasia will never understand about Beige-istan. We are way more practical than we are progressive. [audience laughing and cheering]', 'Sir, what’s your name?', 'Nicholas. Nicholas. Great, perfect.', '[audience laughs]', '[laughs] You’re clapping at “Beige…” Do you know what Beige-istan is?', 'Sort of.', 'Okay. You’re like, “Sort of”? Gentlemen, let me bring you into this as well.', 'My good sir, what’s your name?', 'Vlad. Vlad. Perfect. And…?', 'Ian.', '…Ian. Okay. So there’s… There’s white America. There’s Black America. Then there’s Beige-istan. [audience laughs] And, I mean, that’s just everybody. Indians, Latinos, Filipinos, wherever the fuck Bruno Mars is from. Beige-istan. Right? Okay? Listen, Beige-istan, we got four issues. Politicians, they pander to us. We just got four issues. You do these four, we’ll vote for you. Send this to the governor. These are the four issues. Number one. Give me a green card. [audience laughing and cheering] [laughs] You see that? Everyone, “I’ll suck your dick! Give me that green card!” “Give me an H-1B!” Number two. Believe in God. Preferably one of the religions that makes you feel bad after you masturbate.', '[audience laughs]', 'Those are the real ones. Number three. I told you, I don’t like paying taxes. [audience laughs] Number four. Don’t bomb my home country. [audience cheering and whooping] But if you give me number one… I’ll let you do number four. [Hasan laughs maniacally] The way you leaned into him, you know what I’m talking about! You know the Beige guilt. We feel so much Beige guilt. Oh! We talk about white guilt all the time. You know what you did. God knows what you did, right? Black people, you have no guilt. That’s why you guys can dance, right? You didn’t hurt anybody. Like, “Look at the rhythm.” He can’t dance. Like, “Slavery!” Fuck, right? It’s too much. It’s too much. But Beige guilt’s different. Beige guilt, we’re immigrants. We’re immigrants by choice. We know the world is like Star Wars. You have the Empire ran by Lord Vader, that’s America. [audience laughs] The Empire has all the money, the weapons, the military bases all over the galaxy. And for the past half-century, the Empire has been bombing the shit out of the Rebellion. That’s Beige-istan. Cambodia, Korea, Vietnam, Japan. [scats “The Imperial March', 'Darth Vader’s Theme”] [imitates explosion then screams] Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza.

And for the past 40 years, we’ve been funding the destruction of Tatooine. And we did all that… for a white BMW 3 Series. [audience laughing and whooping] Which ironically looks like a Stormtrooper.

So if you wanna fact-check me, I just wanna let you know, I lease a 2023 Kia Carnival, $431 a month. We leased it from Columbia Kia. We got it at the Summer Kia Sales Event. You can get a brand-new Kia Sorento or Kia Carnival for zero down, zero APR financing. The Kia Summer Sales Event starts now. Kia, movement that inspires. I have to do this now, you guys. I have to be factually accurate. Because I don’t know if you saw this last year. The New Yorker fact-checked my stand-up comedy.', '[audience whooping]', '[laughs] Yeah. They were just like, “Ah! Ho-ho-ho! Breaking news. Magicians aren’t wizards.” And now, now I have a “controversies” tab on my Wikipedia. [audience laughing and applauding] No! Why are you… No! Don’t clap! What are you doing? Why are you clapping? What the fuck is wrong… It’s a dorky controversy. What is wrong with you guys? It’s not even a good one. I didn’t fuck a porn star. [audience laughs] I didn’t diddle a boy. [audience laughs] I got caught embellishing for dramatic effect. [audience laughs] Same crime your aunt is guilty of over Thanksgiving. [audience laughs] [audience cheering and whooping] You know what’s wild? This is the greatest irony. The greatest irony of all of this is that if you want to call me out for being a liar, you don’t have to fact-check my stand-up comedy. I’m a heterosexual man. [audience laughs] I lie all the time. [audience laughs] I let that shit fly like Steph. Like, I’m just like, “Lie.” Oh! Lie. Like, let it fly. Over dumb shit. Stupid… I’ll be at CVS checking out. Just… [imitating scanner beeping] Like, “Oh, my God. Hey!” “Um, do you wanna donate to the American Diabetes Association?” I’ll be like, “Oh, yeah, maybe later.” I’m never donating. [audience laughs] And both my parents have diabetes.', '[audience exclaiming and laughing]', '[Hasan laughs] Yes! You can’t guilt… No, don’t you fucking judge me. I have already donated to the Minhaj Diabetes Association. I bought my dad a fucking Peloton. He never uses it. [audience laughs] He only uses it to hang his wet towels. He’s like, “Oh, look at that. Wow.” “Look at how fast it dries, Hasan. Wow! Why aren’t you donating?” I’m like, “Why aren’t you pedaling?” Let’s start with the problem and not the symptom. I’m never donating. And I’m definitely getting diabetes. That’s the crazy part. And I should care. I’m almost 40 years old. I can feel it. The midlife crisis has hit. There’s a lot of guys my age, around this age. I can feel it in the room. Every guy my age is trying to get rich or ripped as quickly as possible. [audience laughs] Just software engineers out here biohacking. Fucking cold-plunging.

All my homeys out here texting me alpha-male memes, just… “Hard times make hard men.” “Hard men make good times.” “Good times make soft men.” “A society will never value its men until the wolves are at the door.” I’m like, “Sanjay, you’re a software engineer.” “Shut the fuck up.” Why… [audience cheering and whooping] Why are you texting me like you’re Julius Caesar? “Whatever, bro.” “Mamba mentality.” Mamba mentality! Sanjay, you blew your knee out playing pickleball and you’re quoting Kobe Bryant. If Kobe knew you were quoting him, he’d put you in a helicopter and crash that shit himself. [audience exclaiming] [man coughing] You okay, bro? Don’t die. You all right? [audience laughs] [laughs] It wasn’t… How old are you, bro?', 'I’m 19.', 'You’re 19. Big chain poppin’! Ooh! [laughs] [Hasan laughs] There’s a lot of chains on right now. Just a lot of, “Ooh.” A lot of just Desi Drake energy here tonight. The way y’all are lined up is fucking Algebra 2 Trig, just like, ta-ta! Ninety-degree angle just fucking make it. Make it perpendicular. Ladies, you wanna know why all these guys secretly listen to Jordan Peterson?', '[woman 1] Why?', '[woman 2] Why? I’ll tell you why. I’ll tell you. We’re scared. We’re so afraid that the best is behind us. The best hairline. [audience laughs] The best body. The best dick. [audience laughs] Back there. You’re 17, right? [scoffs] I remember 17, man. How old are you?', '[man] I’m 39.', 'You’re 39? Remember when you were 17? Remember when your shit was just like, pow! Remember when it was just… [yells] Right? It was like the Bruce Lee one-inch punch. You’re just like… [yells] [audience laughs] You remember that shit, man? When I’d be at a urinal, it was just… Tsst! Tsst! Tsst! It was like a laser. It was just like fucking SEAL Team Six taking out Osama bin Laden. Just, “Got him!” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, “Clear! Got him!” Right? And now, 38, my shit is just… Whoo. It’s just… Pew! It’s just like an Israeli drone strike. Just… Oh fuck, it’s a school. Oh fuck, it’s a church. Oh, fuck, it’s a refugee camp. I didn’t mean for it to go there. [audience laughs] [Hasan laughs] Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! [laughs] That really divided the room. You know, it’s interesting. That’s every issue in America now. Everything is binary now. War, the economy, politics, it’s just two sides. It’s not what the media’s telling you. It’s not rich versus poor. It’s not Black versus white. It’s not Democrats versus Republicans. It’s insane people and insufferable people.', '[audience laughs]', 'That’s it! All right? [audience cheering and whooping] [Hasan laughs] You know the insane people. You know them. You went to high school with them. They’re still on Facebook. They have a gun in their Facebook profile photo. You’re like, “Whoa, Travis.” “What up?” “Where were you January 6th?” [audience laughs] They’re nuts. They’re nuts. But Travis is fun. [audience laughs] Then there’s the insufferable people. [sighs] [clicks tongue] A lot of them are here tonight. [audience laughs] Just these dorky-ass, teacher’s pet, hall monitors. Just, “No, no, no, no, no!” “No, but actually.” “No, but tech…” These vitamin D-deficient, mouth-breathing, insufferable lo… “You said this, but it’s actually this. You wrote this, but…” “Did you see my Slack? I pinged you.” These insufferable losers that pick pointless fights. The type of insufferable losers that will go on a daytime talk show like Ellen and get mad at Ellen DeGeneres for mispronouncing their name. I mean, what type of insufferable fucking loser would do such a thing?', '[audience cheering and whooping]', 'Yeah, that was me. I was that person. Yes, that’s a rhetorical question. Yes, you were 13 when this happened. Years ago, I went on Ellen’s talk show and I go, “Hey, Ellen.” “Hey, Ellen DeGeneres.” “My name isn’t Hasan Minhaj.” “It’s Hasan Minhaj.” “Say it right.” “This is the name of my ancestors.” Of course she couldn’t say it right. Because she’s Ellen. [audience laughs] She’s a 65-year-old white billionaire who lives in Montecito. She can’t speak Urdu. [audience laughs] She’s Ellen, she’s not a Sufi poet. [audience laughs] And ever since I fought this pointless fight, people say my name worse. [audience laughs] People run up to me in the street and they shout the wrong name at me with vigor. [audience laughs] Like they’re trying to score points on Duolingo. [audience laughs] They’re just like, “Hussein!” [audience laughing] “Hummus!” “Hamas!” Ding, ding, ding! “Yes! Yes! Yes!” “I knew his name was Hamas!” “Five letters. Starts with an H.” “He looks like a Hamas.”', '[audience laughs]', '“Take me to the tunnels.” I’m like, “I don’t know where they are.” Oh, no. Ian! My life is perfect and I’m out here arguing with Ellen over vowels. Why did I do that? Why did I… Why wasn’t… [muttering] Why did I do that? I was so insufferable. I used to make fun of my Chinese friends for having two names. Yeah. I used to make fun of Ronny Chieng for being an Asian sellout. [audience laughs] Wait, you think Ronny Chieng’s real name is Ronny Chieng? [audience laughs] Look at his face. Look at his Chinese-Malay… No! His real name is Xin Yi Chieng. But he knows if he meets Ian… Ian will be like, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, streaming now on Disney Plus.” So instead…', '[audience cheering and whooping]', '…he goes, “Hi!” “I’m Ronald McDonald.” “Nice to meet you.” “Here to bring shareholder value to the company.” “Call me Ron-Ron.” [audience laughs] Because Chinese people are smart. They know you have to have a Chinese name, and then Americans-are-dumb-as-fuck name. [audience laughs] But I was the problem. “No…” [muttering] “It’s the point!” And it bit me in the ass. I remember I used to close my set with this joke. In New York City it would be my closer. I’d be like, “Ronny Chieng is an Asian sellout, good night!” I’m leaving the club. And this woman in the audience gets up and chases me into the street. She was like, “Excuse me.” “Oh, ho-ho! I could be a normal person, but I have a point to prove.” [audience laughs] And I’m not gonna say her ethnicity… [audience laughs] [audience laughs] …but her name was Ashley. [audience laughs] E-I-G-H. Just…', '[audience exclaims]', \"[yells] “Excuse me. Can I see the manager?” “Hi! Hello. Hi.” “Hey stop.” “Hello.” “Hmph.” [audience laughs] “I saw your skit back there.” “And I have to say, ‘really?'” “Really?” “Making fun of Asian names.” “These are the jokes we’re making with our platform?” [audience laughs] “Um, Hagh-hen…” “India is a part of Asia.” “Do better.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Ash-league… [audience laughs] …no the fuck it’s not.” “There’s Indians and there’s Asians.” [audience laughing and whooping] “And we don’t fuck with each other.” [audience laughs] “In fact, Ashley-egg… you can’t stop Asian hate because Asians all hate…” [woman] Each other! “…each other,” thank you! “Furthermore, Ashleg-ha… here’s a dirty little secret.” “White people… [scoffs] …you’re not even the best at racism.” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] Wait, no, don’t get me wrong, they had a lot of hits. They had some bangers, right? Slavery, Jim Crow. Just, mwah, classics. But… But… some new teams have emerged to compete for the title. [audience laughs] See, now this is important. Fact-check me here. See, when white people are racist, they’re racist against people that don’t look like them. [audience laughs] Which is wrong. But it kind of makes sense. Asian people? [audience laughs] We hate people who look exactly fucking like us.\", '[audience cheering and whooping]', 'In fact… if you touch countries with us… [laughs maniacally] …we hate you even more! It’s fucking crazy. Look at us, right? Hindustanis, Indians. Who do we shit on?', '[man] Pakistanis!', 'Pakistanis, right? Pakistanis. You shit on Bengalis. Bengalis, you shit on Sri Lankans. Sri Lankans shit on Nepalese people. That’s just the hairy Asians. [audience laughs] Let’s talk about the hairless Asians, shall we? They’re here. Let’s talk about them. Let’s air it out. Let’s say what we can’t say at the DEI meeting. Let’s just get it out, right? Right? Chinese people. Yes! You shit on Koreans, right? Koreans shit on Japanese people. Japanese people shit back on Koreans. Both of those people shit on Chinese people. Meanwhile, Taiwan and Tibet, they’re like, “Hey!” “What about us?” And China’s like, “Shut the fuck up.” “You don’t even exist.” [laughs] Oh. Oh. You think Fox News dads are the problem? You think Ian’s dad is the problem? [laughs] Really? Try talking race relations with an Indian or Chinese father. Try asking this Indian uncle what he thinks of Black people. Oh, fuck!', 'Oh, ho-ho! Oh!', '[audience exclaiming] Enter the 36 chambers of fucking insanity. Try… [laughs] He’ll be like, “The phones are locked, right?” It’ll be fucking crazy. Try explaining George Floyd to an Indian dad. Oh, I did. Oh, we all did. June, 2020. I’m upstairs in Sacramento, in my childhood bedroom. My dad runs into my bedroom panting. “Oh my God, Hasan, are you watching the news?” “Why is Target on fire?” [audience laughs] This was his line. Target is ablaze. The civil war has begun. Where will I get my towels to hang over my Peloton? [audience cheering and whooping] And I was like, “Dad, stop it.” This is an important moment in our nation’s history. For the first time in 40 years, Beige-istan has been asked to pick a team.', '[audience laughs]', 'And we have to pick a team tonight. My dad’s like, “What are the teams?” [audience laughs] I’m like, “All right, Dad, sit down.” This is important. Let me just explain this to you. [sighs] All right, Dad, there’s two teams. All right? So there’s Black Lives Matter. All right? Black people are saying, “Hey, treat us like human beings.” Then there’s All Lives Matter. And they’re like, “Hey.” “No!” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] Those are the teams. Which team do you wanna pick? And he’s like, “Hasan, both of these people are idiots.” No one matters. [audience laughing and whooping] What? “What’s your GPA? I’ll tell you if you matter.” I mean, this dude is fucking Thanos. I go, “Dad, never say this in public. Don’t go to work and say this.” “We live in America.” “This is a multiracial democracy, Dad, all right?” “We’re trying to unspool the vestiges of white supremacy.” He’s like, “Hasan, white supremacy isn’t real.” “Don’t let them colonize your mind, man.”', '[audience laughs]', '“Come to my office.” You know, every dad has an office. It’s just some room in the house with dusty filing cabinets and a Windows 95 CD-ROM drive. He goes, “Hey, come sit before my Compaq Presario that I’ve had for the past 28 years.” “Sit here. I have to teach you a lesson.” My dad, on his computer, has pulled up a PDF of the US census. It is queued up to income by ethnicity. He’s like, “Read it.” [speaks in Urdu] Okay. These are the highest earners by ethnicity. Number one. Indian Americans. [audience cheering] Average dual, median income, $120,000 per year. [man] Wow. I know, that’s nothing in the Bay. [audience laughs] [laughs] I heard a guy, “Wow.” Number two. Distant second. [audience laughs] Whites. Parentheses, non-Hispanics.', '[audience laughs]', 'Racist. Yo, the US government is so racist. They’re like, “None of you light-skinned, Bad Bunny-looking Latinos.” “None of you Ricky Martin, Pau Gasol-looking Latins.” “We want purebred, Viking, Mayflower white.” Average dual, median income, $76,000 per year. My dad goes, “Hasan, you see that?” [audience laughs] “Ha. Even on their best day, the white man is three-fifths of an Indian.” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] I know. Yo! Bars, Dad. Fucking bars. Up top, Pops. Up top. He’s like, “Now look how much Jews make.” I’m like, “No, no, no. I’m not doing that.” “Come on, man. It’s for research.” I go, “That sounds worse.” Don’t say it’s for research. But that’s my dad. He’s Mufasa, I’m Simba. He lives within me.', '[audience laughs]', 'And now I have a four-year-old son. I can’t teach him that. [laughs] I can’t be like, “Hey, son, no one matters.” Mwah! “Go live your life.” [audience laughs] “Life is nothing but an elephant graveyard.” I can’t do that. I remember I was back home in Sacramento. I was visiting my parents because they have diabetes. [audience laughs] This is a powerful moment in my life. Because I have two children now. I have my kids and I have my parents. [audience laughs] I’m sitting in between. We’re sitting on the couch. Seventy-four-year-old dad. Four-year-old son. I’m in the middle. And they’re both just screaming into their iPads. [audience laughs] They’re like, “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” Right? I’m like, “I’m here, don’t you cry.” “Don’t you cry.” [speaks in Urdu] “Don’t you cry. I’m here.” I’m the halftime show. I have to figure out, what am I taking from this old man and passing on to my son? What is some shit I got to delete?', '[audience laughs]', 'That’s our biggest challenge, right? How do we break generational trauma? We have to figure out, what’s an heirloom that we take from our past and pass on? And what is some baggage we gotta leave at Goodwill? [audience laughs] Because our parents, they fucked us up. They gave us a lot of baggage. But at the same time, there’s a lot of beautiful heirlooms that our parents gave us in Beige-istan that we took for granted. Uncle, we took this for granted. Here’s something you gave your children that they took for granted. No matter how bad you fuck up in Beige-istan, tax evasion, fraud, stand-up comedy… [audience laughs] …you can always go home. In fact…', '[audience cheering and whooping]', '…our parents’ greatest dream would be if we never left home. I’m almost 40 years old. I have a wife, I have two kids. My mom’s greatest dream would be if I moved back upstairs to my childhood bedroom. Just quietly having an orgasm underneath the Scottie Pippen poster, just… Just, “Oh, babe, keep it down.” “Sweetheart, my mom’s downstairs. Just be quiet.” My mom would be thrilled. “Wow, my son is climaxing under Toy Story sheets.” “This is what I always wanted.” “Our khandan is together.” She would come in with sliced fruit, just… “Kids, do you want apples?” I’d be like, “Mom!” [audience laughs] “I told you, I like peanut butter!” [audience laughs] “Bring me peanut butter!” But Ritz-cracker Americans? Purebred capital-A Americans? No, no, no, no, no. Zero to eighteen, you get to live at home. The day you turn 18… I’ve been to the graduation party. Dad gets on the mic. “Travis!” “Ha, ha. Happy graduation, bud.” “Get the fuck out of my house!”', '[audience whooping]', '“The next time you walk through that door, you better PayPal me, bitch.” I mean, this… [audience laughs] This is why there’s so many homeless people in America. None of these people can go home. [audience laughs] Oh, are you getting uptight? You getting uptight? Really? Really? Let me ask you a question, San Jose. Have you ever seen an Indian homeless person in America? [audience cheering and whooping] Huh? No. Hey, I’ll bet you a Kia Carnival. [audience laughs] Let’s go to the worst part of the Bay… Let’s go to the Tenderloin tonight, all right? Just imagine seeing a 5’7″ bespeckled Indian man. Cardboard cutout, “Hungry, homeless.” “I need help.” You’d be like, “Rajif?” [audience laughs] “Go home.” [audience laughs] “Come home. Live… What are you doing? Get in the car.” [audience laughs] [laughs] Okay, to be fair. To be fair… There are a lot of Indian homeless people in India. [audience laughs] There’s like a lot. They’ve won the Oscar, they made documentaries, it’s crazy. [laughs]', 'Where’s your family from originally?', 'Bangalore.', 'Bangalore? Ever been back?', 'Yeah. You remember when you go back to the motherland, back to Beige-istan, and you’re sitting in the rickshaw with your mom the first time.', 'Right? 17, you’re young.', 'They walk up… Yeah, then the kid with one arm walks up to the… Starts banging on the window with the stub, just… “Madam! Madam!” “Please, madam, please!” [speaks in Urdu] “Give me one rupee, please.” Then your mom, she’s a piece of shit. She goes, “Don’t look at them!” “Don’t you look at them. They’ll steal your soul!” “Don’t look at them!” And she goes, “I’m sorry!” “I’m sorry, I don’t have any money. I have to buy jewelry.” [audience laughs] “I have to buy bangles. Do you understand?” “See, bangles, they go on your arms.” “But you don’t have any arms, so you wouldn’t understand.” [audience laughs] “And me getting bangles is more important than you eating.” Am I lying? Am I lying? Go into any Desi woman’s closet. That shit is like the cave scene from Aladdin, just… “Touch nothing but the lamp.” I mean, auntie, look at you. Just fucking bedazzled. You just robbed pirates. Look, just… Ah! Just fucking rapper bling. [audience laughs] You know all those kids, right?', '[boy] Huh?', 'You know, when you sit in the rickshaw. And all those kids surround your car like The Walking Dead? [hisses] Right? [audience laughs] They’re all related. They’re all family. That’s what I want for my kids. [audience laughs] I’m not giving them shit. I want them to beg as a family. [audience laughs] But they can live with me. That I will allow. Mi casa, su casa. Come and go as you please. No boundaries. We don’t believe in boundaries. [audience laughs] [laughs] Okay, let me ask you a question. Watch me hit this… This is a Tim Duncan bank shot. Watch me land this joke perfect. Okay? I’m 38. He’s 17, right?', 'What’s your name?', 'Sunaad.', 'What’s that?', 'Sunaad. Sunaad? Watch this. Sunaad, growing up, could you close your bedroom door and then lock the bedroom? Of course not! This is what I’m talking about! No! If I… [audience cheering and whooping] If I locked my bedroom door, that shit would turn into The Shining within sec… “Hey! Hey! Hey!” “Are you watching pornography?” And it’s like… [audience laughs] [audience whooping] I am. [audience laughs] But it’s none of your business. “Never lock the door!” Why? Why? Uncle, why? What’s the logic? Why? Why can’t we… It doesn’t make sense! “Never lock the door.” I tried to explain this to my… “Dad, what if I have to go to the bathroom and take a dump?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “Then close the door.” “But don’t lock it.” [audience laughs] “I might have to take a shower.”', '[audience laughing and whooping]', 'You laugh. No, no, no, you laugh. That’s how much my dad loves me. He’s willing to take a hot shower in my shit fumes. [audience laughs] Just… [singing in Urdu] [imitates farting] That is love. [audience laughs] You wish your dad knew your scent, Ian. But no. No, no, no. In Caucasia, you love your boundaries. “Boundaries!” “Hey, Mom? Boundaries!” “Mom? Hey, bitch, these are my boundaries, you bitch.” “I know I ripped through your vagina to your taint, but these are my boundaries, you bitch.” Not only are you obsessed with emotional boundaries, you’re obsessed with physical boundaries. You literally pick the boundaries for the entire world. [audience laughs] You’re like, “Oh…” [audience whooping] “Africa, here are your boundaries.” “Asia, here are your boundaries.” “Middle East, here are your boundaries.” “Peace.” No, there’s no peace. [audience laughs] We’re around the corner from the election. What’s the biggest issue that the Republicans are using in regards to your safety?', '[man] The border.', 'The border. [audience laughs] A bunch of Republican senators are out here acting like hormonal teenagers. They’re like, “Hey, Mexico.” [audience laughs] “Respect our boundaries.” [audience laughs] Then there’s a bunch of Mexican uncles at the border. They’re like, “Señor, why is the door locked?” [audience laughs] [speaks in Spanish] “Why is the door locked? Esta es mi casa.” “Don’t ever lock the door!” World War III is about to pop off because disputes over what? Boundaries! Boundaries. That’s gonna be the downfall of Western civilization. Sunaad, do you know what our downfall will be? [man] What? Hoarding! [audience laughs] Our parents love to hoard. [man whoops] Everything, just fucking Subway napkins. Ha, ha! Taco Bell fire sauce. Red crushed pepper from Dominos.', 'Just poverty mentality.', '[audience cheering and whooping] Go into any immigrant household. Go to the drawer next to the spoons. [audience cheering and whooping] “Why do you have six kilos of Parmesan cheese… [audience laughs] …from Round Table Pizza?” “You can take my green card, but you can’t take my Parmesan cheese!” [man whoops] Not only do our parents physically hoard, they emotionally hoard. [audience laughs] Oh, every grievance, every trauma. Right here. Right here. Every time you fuck up, “I’ll remember.” They never clear cookies and cache. [audience laughs] My parents, they’ve been together 40 years. Okay, they’ve been adjacent for 40 years. [audience laughs] I’ve never seen them hug. I’ve never seen them kiss. They’re just planking in their stubbornness. Just, “Fuck you!” “No, fuck you!” “Fuck you!” “You die!” “No, you die, that way I get the house and I can talk shit about you to the grandkids!” I had to have an intervention. I go, “Mom, Dad!” “You clearly don’t like each other.”', '[audience laughs]', '“You obviously don’t love each other.” “So either get a divorce, or go to therapy.” And my dad’s like, “Hasan, I’m not paying someone $200… [audience laughs] …when we can argue in this kitchen for free.” [audience laughing and whooping] And now I’m in therapy. Because I don’t wanna end up like them. But here’s the thing, I don’t think it works. Do you have friends that are in therapy, but they’re still shitty people? All my friends that are therapied up are the most mentally ill people that I know. They’ve just learned fancy words to avoid accountability. I have a friend that still owes me money for a concert. I tried to call him on it. I was like, “Scott, you owe me $350.” He’s like, “I hear you.” [audience laughs] “I receive you.” “But I don’t have the bandwidth.” I’m like, “Dammit, Scott!” Get more bandwidth. [audience laughs] Look, therapy’s important, but it is not a flex. Stop bragging about it. “I’m doing the work.” “I’m unpacking my tru…” I don’t need you to unpack. I need you to change.', '[audience laughing and whooping]', 'You know what it is? Therapy has to be like a haircut. You can’t tell us about it. We have to notice the difference. [audience laughing and whooping] Listen, man, I’m telling you from experience, I’ve done it all. Don’t waste your money. I’ve done it all. I’ve done all the therapies. CBT. Couples therapy, immersive therapy. Let me just say this, okay? If you go to therapy, you deserve a therapist that understands you culturally. [audience cheering] Because I’ve had all the therapists, okay? I had Janet, okay? Janet didn’t cut it. [audience laughs] Janet, big-scarf energy. Buddha statue. She’s never been to Asia. I was her little anthropology experiment. She’s like, “Interesting, fascinating. This is like a trip to the Orient.” “You know, Hasan, every time we’re in a session and your phone goes off and it says ‘Mom cell, ‘ ‘Dad… ‘ You have this need to pick up.” You go, “boop.” “Why?” “Why?” “Can we talk about boundaries?” [audience laughs] And I’m like, “Janet, shut the fuck up.”', '[audience laughs]', \"You guys are individualists. We’re collectivists. How do I get you to understand where I’m coming…? “Okay, Janet, pretend this doesn’t say ‘Mom cell.'” “Pretend it says ‘dog cell.'” “Can I pick up?” [audience laughs] She’s like, “Of course!” I’m like, “What’s up, dog? You good?” “Oh my God, Janet, My dog needs insulin.” “Should I give her insulin or establish boundaries?” She goes, “What kind of dog?” “A goldendoodle.” “Not your goldendoodle!” I go, “I know.” [laughing] Oh! I see the dog people are in their feelings right now. [laughs] Oh, shit. My buddy Prashanth told me, he’s like, “Hasan, do not do the dog material on Netflix.” “Dogs are sacred in America.” “Talk about something less controversial, like the Middle East.”\", '[audience laughing and whooping]', '[laughs] But it’s not… No! It’s insane. It’s fucking insane. There are… “I love my dog.” “My dog is a member of my family.” You people are out of your fucking minds. “But you don’t… you don’t get it.” “You don’t get it.” “Once you lock eyes…” No, no, no, I get it. The only reason why you love your dog is because you’re never in trouble with your dog. You’re a piece of shit, and your dog is too dumb to know that you’re a piece of shit. [audience laughing and whooping] You love your dog. And you love your mom. But only one of them gets to live in your home. [audience laughs] Oh, ho-ho, but best believe the day your dog is able to talk, and it’ll happen in our lifetime… [audience laughs] …and he’s like, “Hey!” “Why are your pillowcases so dirty?” [audience laughs] You’ll be like, “Chauncey… boundaries.” [audience laughs] [Hasan laughs] What was I expecting? Why the fuck was I listening to Janet give me opinions on how to deal with immigrant parents? We fired Janet. “Janet, you’re out.” “Jithra, you’re in.”', '[audience laughs]', \"Now we have a South Asian therapist. She gets it. Jithra’s downloaded all the seasons of our culture’s trauma, okay? She knows all the baggage we wanna get rid of. She knows all the heirlooms we wanna pass on. She knows that we’re building a new future for our kids. I remember in one of our sessions, like ten minutes in, she cut me off, she goes, “Hasan, I know what’s wrong. I’m not supposed to, but I’ll tell you.” I go, “Jithra, this is what the fuck I’m talking about!” “You know we love shortcuts.” “Be direct. Talk to me.” She goes, “I don’t know if anyone’s told you this, Hasan, but you’re pretty manic.” “Now, you have something that the eldest child in every family from Beige-istan has.” [woman] Whoo! “The eldest child always has something called, ‘Good kid syndrome.'”\", '[audience whooping and applauding]', '“The eldest child of the family feels like they have to take care of everybody in the family.” “Oh, Mom needs this.” “Oh, but your dad needs this.” “Your sister said this, but your brother did that.” “Your aunt’s doing this, but your uncle did this.” “And you feel like you have to plug every hole.” “But you’re always one hole behind.” [audience laughs] And I go, “That’s how I feel.” [audience laughs] “You probably feel really anxious around your loved ones.” “I feel so anxious.” [audience laughs] “You probably have a lot of secrets.” I go, “I have so many secrets.” “Dark secrets.” I go, “They’re fucking dark, Jithra.” “Now, if you wanna cast a light on that darkness, we really need to talk about your kinks.” [audience laughs] What? “What are your kinks, Hasan?” We don’t talk about this in Beige-istan. Individual pleasure. BDSM, sadism, voyeurism, torture, humiliation. [imitates whip cracking] Whipping. “What’s your kink?” And I… Acceptance. [audience laughs] That’s all I’ve ever wanted. I don’t want a ball gag.', '[audience cheering and applauding]', 'I don’t want latex. Just put me in a padded room with my wife and my dad, and have them gently whisper in my ear. “Hey, big boy.” “Guess what?” “No one is mad at you.” [audience laughs] And I will cream my pants. This is my wife’s kink, all right? We’re in a padded room. My dad’s not there. [audience laughs] And I whisper in her ear. And I go, “Hey, babe.” “Guess what?” “When my mom is old and decrepit, I won’t let her live with us.” [audience laughs] [Hasan] Ho, ho! I see a lot of women clapping! Really? Really? I thought we were the good progressives. I thought we support all women. Except my mother-in-law. Fuck that bitch! Really? That’s where our beautiful collective spirit dies. It dies at mother-in-law? Dude, I’m in the session. My wife’s kink is boundaries. I go, “Babe, we cannot have this.” “I know my parents are insane, but we cannot do this.” “Let’s not even be progressive. Let’s be practical.” “If we kick our parents out and our kids see it… [audience laughing] …we might be the first Indian homeless people in America.”', '[audience whooping]', 'Because best believe 40 years from now, we’re both gonna be built like gulab jamuns.

I would run to the car. I’d get a gun. I would blow that fucking door down. I’d go, “Get on the fucking ground, you ungrateful piece of shit!” He’d be like, “Oh my God, Dad, where did you get that gun?” “I got a gun for this joke, you idiot. Don’t fact-check comedy.” “Listen to me, we gave you everything.” “We got rid of all of our baggage. “We gave you every heirloom.” “We still go to therapy. We still fuck.” “You have any idea what you did to your mother’s hips?

Uh, to me, it’s not the same country anymore. You have to have a high-speed Internet, you have to pay extra gigabytes on your phone if you go over. Yes. So you’re going over on the phone. Even the American people have to pay extra. So your problem really is a data plan. [crowd laughing] So if we just bring you to Verizon, you might stay? But you sound like you want to self-deport.

This guy. Stand up for a minute, because you agree with him. Will you stand up? Let’s stand up for a minute. The Unabomber wants to say a few words here. Now, you agreed, when Luis was talking about how much money you can make, and the women… What do you say to him? Well, honestly, I’m about women, but I’m not necessarily about America. And I mean, the ladies down South… [crowd booing] [man] I mean, I’m not anti-America.', 'I’m, like, I’m neutral.', 'Come on. Come on, let him… Hold on, let him… let him finish.

When… Stand up for a minute. When… When he says he likes these muy caliente ladies from down South, how does that make you feel? I mean, like, power to him, he’s with me right now, you know. I enjoy him and everything, but, you know, if he was ever to meet one of these ladies and he wanted to do that, I’d be, you know…', 'More power to him.', '[scattered cheers] Look what a great country this is. Look how understanding these two homeless people are about each other’s sexual proclivities. There’s… [chuckling] There’s no other country in the world where you’ll have an unhoused couple like this crawl out of their tent, go to a Tim Dillon taping and say, “Honey, you can fuck whoever you want as long as you steal some canned food and bring it back to this tent at night.” I mean, look at these two. This is what America is about.', '[crowd chanting] USA! USA! USA! This is what America is about. This Orange County couple is so fucking scared right now. Knife them after the show. Run up on them and knife ’em. Take their fucking BMW and their fucking sailboat or whatever. Well, is anyone an immigrant in this audience? Okay, we want to hear from immigrants, especially this white woman who’s lying about it. [crowd laughing] She better have a real fucking Ukrainian accent when I get up to this fucking woman. Hold on, where did you come from? Canada.', '[crowd jeering]', '[chanting] USA! USA! USA! [chanting fades]', 'Kill that Canadian bitch after the fucking show, okay? You fucking… These tweakers are going to light you on fire after this fucking show. These extras from Breaking Bad, these monsters. We paid for their STD check before they came here.

That’s not what I mean. I mean in the racist way.', 'Like the Orange County people would say.', 'Oh. Where does your family come from? Mexico. Both from Mexico. And look how… And you are thriving here. I actually love it here, yeah.', 'What do you do for a living?', 'Customer support for education tech. Kill yourself. Here’s the thing… I cannot find one reason to keep this man in this shithole of a country. I cannot.

What you two should do, I’m not kidding, is get with him later and do some fun home invasions. You know what I mean? Bandit, do you feel freer in America than you would be other places? [Bandit] Of course, Tim. Of course I do. I mean, there’s… sure… Okay, you have a few options, right? Mainly, at least for me, Britain and Canada. I don’t wanna go to Canada because they’re not real. That’s mooses pretending to be people. Well, you’re a person pretending to be a dog. This is true. I would get along great with them. Now, Sergio, just look at Bandit and tell him what could be possibly wrong with this country? [Bandit] What’s wrong with America? Look at this person, who I will not gender. Look at this person, Sergio. What could possibly be wrong with this country? Look, if you want to look for an apartment, you have to pay the first, the last, plus deposit. Six hundred eighty score to get the apartment.', 'You have that?', 'That is true. He’s bringing up a good point about the apartment rental process, Bandit. Which I don’t think you have been in. Uh, just a hunch. [Bandit] That’s America, baby. Money flows, dude. If you ain’t ready to pay to have an apartment, why… Don’t go to one! Luis, you seem very uncomfortable.', '[crowd laughing]', '[Tim] You seem incredibly uncomfortable right now. Take a look at this. This is… There it is. Sergio, yes. I think he makes more money standing at a corner with a sign. Moving it. [laughing] That’s not a bad point. Bandit, make your last plea to Sergio. You’re the one we brought on this stage because you exemplify what America is in its current moment. [Bandit] Sergio, I beg you. Stay here. We can go to Target together. We can go get a Java Chip Frappé, we can walk through the park, have a wonderful time. Maybe fall in love. I don’t know. It’s the land of opportunity. I would love for you to stay here with us and be a part of this great, beautiful nation. Give it up for Bandit, everyone, that’s a great…', '[crowd applauding]', 'Sergio, are you gonna stay, or are you gonna go? What is it? Uh… There is, uh, nothing that make me stay. I’m leaving. And I’m leaving America. The American Dream, it’s over. [crowd booing] I’m telling you, I’m out of here. I’m out of here, you know?', '[crowd chanting] Adios! Adios!', 'That’s… That’s the way he feels. Give it up for Sergio,', '[crowd cheering]', '[Tim] Luis, Bandit, everybody. Thank them so much. Give it up for them. Give it up. Thank you, guys.

It’s good.', 'Go, Mom.', '[Tim yelling] Come on! [crowd cheering]', 'Eat the cherry! Get it. Eat the cherry!', 'Dena! Dena! Dena! [chanting] Dena! Dena!', '[Livi] Eat the cherry!', 'Guys, give it up for Livi and Dena! Give it up for them, everybody! [crowd cheering] Thank you so much. That’s $10,000 of Netflix’s money. That’s… This was the last season of House of Cards they didn’t make. [laughing] I appreciate that. A round of applause again for Dena and Livi, everybody.', '[crowd cheering]', 'That goes right to the homeless. Take that outside to the homeless encampment right now. I’m still trying to process this row. This row is a wild row, I like this row. This is a wild row. This white guy is so scared in the middle of this row right now, he has no idea what happened. You just landed in the middle of a Kamala Harris rally. You have no idea what’s going on. This white guy is terrified, but he’s also aroused, and that’s what it’s about. That’s America right now. Are we ready to meet some new, fun people? [crowd whooping, cheering] He said she’s turned her back on God and sold her soul to OnlyFans. But what he really wants is her to collaborate on YouTube with him again. Welcome to Gen Z hell. Everybody, welcome Christian.', '[upbeat synth music playing]', '[crowd cheering]', '[Tim] Christian, come out. Thank you. Sit down.', 'Christian, take a seat.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you. Hello.', 'Take a seat, Christian. Now, you used to collaborate a lot with your cousin Bela. -Yes, I did.', 'On YouTube. Yes. She was like my best friend, we grew up together. I’ve known her since, you know, I was a baby.', '[Tim] You’ve known her since you were a baby?', 'She’s on YouTube.', 'Yes. Disrespecting men. What is that? Can you define that? So, she’ll post a video and be like, you know, “Hey,” you know, “cuss word,” um, “give me some money,” you know. Like, disrespects them and asks for money, and then they’ll actually send it, kind of like a gold digger, but, you know, online. So you don’t think that’s a good use of her time? Um… [sighs] Honestly, I think she should do what we used to do.', 'Like, different types of content.', 'What did you used to do? We used to do just normal challenge videos, you know, a basic…', '[crowd booing]', '[Tim] Christian. Nobody wants you and your cousin doing fucking challenge videos. Okay, my bad, my bad. They would rather her doing findom or whatever she’s doing on YouTube.', 'That’s right.', '[Christian] My bad.', 'My bad.', '[crowd cheering] Should we bring her out? Should we meet her, everybody?', '[cheering loudly]', '[Tim] Should we meet her?', '[crowd chanting] Bring her out! Bring her out! Bring her out! Let’s bring out Bela, everybody.', '[crowd cheering, whooping]', 'Hi. He says only God, she says OnlyFans. Now, Bela, what is the beef? What is his problem? He has a different perspective on how I make my money because, you know, his parents still pay his bills.', '[Tim] Whoa!', 'What? Wait.', '[crowd jeering]', 'Whoa, Christian.', '[Christian] Wait. [chuckles] Mommy and Daddy don’t pay my bills, so… That’s right. Men on the Internet do. Now… [scattered laughter] What do you do to, uh, get these men to pay? Bully them. My mom’s literally subscribed to my OnlyFans to keep me accountable. I don’t post anything inappropriate. Your mom is subscribed to your OnlyFans to keep you accountable? [Bela] Yeah. That should have been the title of the segment. Now… [laughing] Now, Christian, why is it your business if your cousin wants to pop her P for cash? Um… Uh, you know, I care about her and I look out for her, I love her, she’s, like, my best friend, like, I want to be involved. -I want the best for her.', 'If you love her, pay her. [crowd cheering] -Thank you.', 'All right, fine. Fine! I don’t do anything inappropriate, I don’t talk dirty, I don’t sell my body. I literally bully them.', 'They just like to be degraded.', 'Mm… How long do you plan on making money like this? I make 20K a month off these guys, so until that goes away… Whoa.', '[Christian] What?', '[Tim] Wow. Now, get up for a minute. Get up. Let’s be honest, both of you. Now, you’re a subscriber.', 'Is it…', '[Christian] Wait, what? Is it weird to see her in real life? [chuckles]', 'No.', 'Yeah, now, what do you think about this? Who do you think is right here? The… You know, I don’t even know which, but, you know, what’s going on?', '20K a month is good. I’d… I’d say her.', '[Bela] Thank you. Okay, what do you think about this? Her too.', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Right. Thank you. It’s the Charlottesville Riot. Thank you, guys, for coming here. This is such a weird Gen Z fucking problem.', 'Know what I mean? I get it.', 'This is normal! You don’t want her to do fucking OnlyFans, but you want her to waste time with you, do YouTube, that’s the worst argument.', 'Thank you.', '[Tim] You know what I mean? You’re not offering her a better alternative. Okay. Um, we could play Minecraft, Fortnite…', '[Tim] Oh my God.', '[crowd booing]', 'Oh my God, dude, no.', '[Christian] What? Boo!', '[Tim] No Minecraft.', 'Where’s the money? Can you stand up, sir? Can you stand up? You got an erection when you heard the word “Minecraft.” [crowd laughing] Now, Fortnite is… Now, let me… Will you play Fortnite with this guy so he doesn’t bother this woman? He seems a bit boring.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah. It’s crazy to ask… Are you a gamer?', 'Not particularly.', 'Really? Yeah. OnlyFans is more fun than gaming, it seems. Okay, all right. Would you subscribe?', 'How much is it a month?', '[Bela] I’ll bully you! I don’t want to be bullied, no. You don’t wanna be bullied? He had enough of it in high school. All right. [crowd applauding] Come here, what do you think? Are you… Who do you… Are you… Will you stand up for Christian? No one will. What do you think? I will stand for my family. And them both are my family.', 'That’s my cousin!', 'Oh, this is your cousin? Really?

As family goes, we like to stick together, so I don’t want to choose both. But make your money. Respectfully.', 'All right. That’s fair.', '[Bela] Thank you! That’s fair.', 'All right, that’s fair.', 'He gets it. Bela, is there anything, is there any way that you would stop doing OnlyFans? No. All right. Give it up for Bela and Christian, everybody. Clap it up for them. They should both go to jail.', '[crowd booing]', '[Tim] I’ve never met a more… I’ve never met a more hateable person. All right. I’ve never met a more hateable person. All right.

I mean… And now, he’s here to tell his wife he lost $200,000 on NFTs, but don’t worry, he’s still a true believer. Let’s meet Francesco, everybody.', '[upbeat synth music playing]', '[crowd cheering]', '[Tim] Yeah!', 'What’s up?', '[Tim] Francesco. Francesco, you look like every friend I had who lost money on NFTs. [Tim laughs] Tell us what happened. Well, the first NFT that I invested in was a… was a picture of a 3D monkey.', 'Was it the Bored Ape?', 'It was a derivative of that.', 'It was a derivative?', 'Yes. So, it wasn’t the Bored Ape Yacht Club, it was a knockoff…', '[crowd booing]', 'Hey! Hey! Hey! Jesus Christ. Hold on. This guy’s out here baring his soul.', '[laughing]', 'Now, how much… do you go and lose with NFTs after it’s all said and done? So, you know, after we were buying and selling and, you know, doing all that, I was in the hole about 200 grand, you know, by the end of it [crowd] Ooh. Okay. And your wife does not know this? No, she has no clue that I lost that much money, yeah.', 'Yeah. [chuckles]', '[crowd] Ooh. How do you think she’s gonna react when you tell her? Well, my wife actually does have a finance background, and she works for a big financial institution, and she’s been telling me that this is not a… wasn’t a good idea for a long time. You know, for sure. So, wait a minute. Your wife, with the financial background, was telling you that this was not a good idea? No. And you still dumped $200,000 of family money into the… To be fair, $200,000 was what I lost. I dumped a lot more than that into it.', '[Tim] Okay, all right. All right. To be… If we’re gonna be honest, air out our dirty laundry.', '[Tim] Okay, that’s fine. All right, everybody, are you guys ready?', '[crowd cheering]', '[chanting] Bring her out!

Two hundred thousand dollars?', 'Yep.', 'Are you insane?', 'Are you insane?', '[sighing] Two hundred thousand dollars? Only when what you do… You know, when people say what you do is crazy, only then are you doing enough. That’s what I live by, that’s my…', '[Lindsey] Babe.', 'That’s my, like… [crowd booing] Two hundred thousand dollars? Wait a minute, what Gary Vaynerchuk quote is that? Come here for a second. If this guy… If anyone will agree with you, it’s gonna be someone like this here. Come here, let me… You look pretty sympathetic to this. Do you support… This is a guy you’d do coke with in Miami. Now, what are you… When you hear this guy, what do you think? He lost $200,000, how do you feel? All right, admittedly, I did trade crypto. [crowd laughing, cheering] Wait a minute, we are… we are shocked. You could have opted into, like, a Roth IRA, you could have put your money into a trust, government bonds. Those pay out so well, in, like, 30 years. You would have been set up for retirement. [crowd booing] All right, sit down. Sit down. This guy’s cucking for JPMorgan on the show, that’s not what we want. I got him up because I thought he was going to be cool and on Molly and shit. And then he’s talking about fucking Roth IRAs. Your husband’s a lot cooler than this fucking guy.', 'I’m telling you right now.', 'He’s not. Will you… Can you… Can you please just weigh in here because you look like a scumbag. Is there any way… Can you please back this guy up? Is there any… I mean, you understand, right?', 'It could have gone up.', '[Lindsey] Do not do it. I wish I could, I don’t think he has it. I think you got to switch turns. Let her handle the finances. You handle the children, seems you’re more capable of that.', 'What do you… Oh-ho-ho-ho. Wait a minute.', '[crowd] Oh! Is there anyone who will support this guy?', 'Is there any guy who will? Or woman?', 'No.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, stand up. Thank you, guy. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so mu… You look like a character witness in a rape trial. [crowd laughing] I mean, Jesus Christ. [laughs] Hey, it was a tough year. You were trying to do something good for your family. You were trying to make an investment. This is America. And the dream can happen. Listen, Lindsey, American Psycho makes a good point. I mean, even on the way here, I see this fucking hamster, with, like, money popping off of it. And I’m like, “What is that?”', 'Hamster Kombat. Big crypto.', 'What is that?', 'Hamster Kombat.', 'That’s the shit I don’t want to see. Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on. Hamster Kombat? Hamster Kombat. Yes.', 'This sounds kinda badass.', '[Francesco] It’s pretty good. Wait a minute. Hold on. What… Is it hamsters that kind of fight? No! It’s one hamster.', 'And all it does is…', 'She doesn’t understand. He just hits it and little money signs pop up. No, but I like this. Go on about this. Now… No, no, no, you judgmental cunts. Now, listen to me, this… This is a hamster and what happens? Well, the hamster, it just appears out of thin air, the more you touch it, the more you… the more you click on it, and then it becomes a CEO, -and you can buy a Lambo with the ham…', '[crowd booing] Lindsey, you see this hamster on the plane, what do you think? Right. I’m like, “Okay, what the hell are you doing?” I’m like, “Turn the phone. Let me see the phone.” “Let me see the phone.” Know what it was?', 'It was…', 'A woodchuck? It was two cartoon women called, “Twerk-something,” and the more you press it, the bigger their butts grow. [crowd laughing, cheering] It’s a mini-game that’s part of Hamster Kombat. So to answer your question, to answer your question, what I would like is to not ever see any of this shit again. Francesco, will you promise to your beautiful pregnant wife right now that you will not play… Mm-hmm. …with hamsters, penguins, apes, or big-butted women? If that’s what it takes to keep you…', '[crowd jeering]', 'If that’s what it takes… if that… If… If… If it’s my wife or the crypto, I would choose my wife. All right, give them a round of applause. Let’s give them a round of applause. Lindsey, do you accept this? I’ll believe it when I see it. All right. Well, give her a big hug. Give her a big hug and a kiss.', 'Come on.', '[crowd applauding]', '[Tim] That’s your hamster right there.', 'That’s your big hamster.', '[Francesco] I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Lindsey and Francesco, everybody.', 'Give them a round of applause.', '[crowd cheering]', '[Tim] Give ’em a round of applause. Thank you guys so much for coming on. Good luck. Francesco, I have some opportunities for you later. We’ll figure it out. We’ll talk. Well, after what we’ve seen here tonight, we can only come to one conclusion. Harvey Weinstein is innocent.', '[shocked laughter]', 'I’m kidding. I’m kidding. The American people are very sick and there’s not much we can do about it. There’s not enough prisons to house them, and we can’t send them all to fight China. So, what can we do? We can keep feeding them and paying them for sex. Thank you for watching, and register to vote! Good night!', '[cheering]', '[upbeat synth music playing] Are you willing to twerk for Kamala? Twerk for Kamala right now. Twerk for Kamala. That’s not twerking. That’s not twerk. That’s horrible. -You say you’re a magician, right?', 'Yeah. So pull the rabbit out of the hat and follow the White Rabbit for the truth. Okay, that was terrible. But the point is this… It was absolutely terrible.', 'Freedom…', '[crowd] Yeah. [crowd jeering] How… How fucking stupid is the entire… I mean, this is amazing. These women are treating you like a piñata, but you’re allowing it to… That’s… And it’s not because you’re Mexican. It’s not because you’re Mexican. Oh, Mom!

Thank you, Hawaii! I’m turning 38, so I’m harvesting my wife’s eggs this year. I’m harvesting my wife’s eggs so that we can make embryos, so we can freeze the embryos, so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when you’ve given up on your own hopes and dreams.', '[crowd laughing]', 'I’m still trying here! I look at my friends who are my age who have kids, and they all look like shit. [crowd laughing] It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my Instagram too much. With their fucking haggard faces. Just drooping, wrinkly crow’s-feet-embedded heads. Receding hairlines. Just withering, graying hair coming out in clumps. Because of their children. Like, I did a show, and someone I went to high school with in Singapore came to the show, and after the show, I met up with them, and they brought another person with them, and I was like, “Oh, is this other person your mom?” “Thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show.” And that other person was also someone I went to high school with. [crowd laughing] That’s how fucking ugly…', '[crowd laughing]', '…these people have become because of their children. Just unrecognizable. So I’m trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit. And, um, first step of harvesting my wife’s eggs is, I have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks. So, I have to inject my wife. I am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks. Zero medical training. I was given no medical training whatsoever. The government lets you do this. The… The doctor asked me to do it. The doctor was like, “Hey, have you ever held a needle before?” “No? Perfect, here, take this, and inject your wife in the middle of her body, like Nicolas Cage in The Rock.”', '[crowd laughing]', '“Twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you.” “Mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes.” “Just trust us that it’s the right thing that you’re injecting into the person you love the most.” Internet chemicals that show up… It comes in a powder! I have to make it into a liquid, you understand? It’s a meth lab in my kitchen as I’m mixing… the comp… I’m sweating the whole time ’cause I’m scared I’ll fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely, then you have to, like… The air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements. And then you have to put it in the syringe. Then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude like you know what you’re doing.', '[crowd laughing]', '[scattered applause]', 'I don’t know what I’m doing! I saw someone do this on Doogie Howser.', '[crowd laughing]', '[crowd whooping]', 'I don’t even know the angle to put it into her. [chuckling] Like, it looks so painful going in, like… I love my wife so much I can’t even bear to watch her in pain. I couldn’t even bear to watch the needle go into her. I had to inject my wife like this. I had to, like, cover my eyes, and, like, backhand it…', '[crowd laughing]', '…into her like Kurosawa. [imitates sword slash] “Did I get the middle of your body?” “No?” “Okay, just walk into the needle!” [crowd laughing] “I’m supposed to do all the work here? Meet me halfway.” And, uh, the doctor said, “If you do everything right, if you… measure correctly, you inject at the right times, they scan, like, this part of her body, you know, that Chicago Bulls logo.', 'Right? And they were like…', '[crowd laughing] …”If you do everything right, based on what we can tell, you should expect 15 eggs.” [inhales] And my wife ended up getting 26.', '[scattered whooping and applause]', 'Yeah. Always a… [applause] Yeah, always like a late, half-hearted response to… [crowd laughing] Usually, the women in the crowd are like, “Whoo, yeah.” All the men in the crowd are always like… [crowd laughing] “Is that a good number?” “Is 26 a good number of eggs?” “How many eggs equal one bebe?” “Is it four eggs is one bebe?” “So 26 eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together…” Let me put this in a language that men can understand, okay? Twenty-six eggs from one vagina, in one cycle, is MVP numbers.', '[crowd laughing]', 'Twenty-six eggs is like, if Magic Johnson averaged the triple-double and killed his own AIDS.', '[crowd laughing]', 'Okay? That’s the level of medical miracle that’s happening in whatever this part of my wife’s body, that horn of the bull that, like, curls into itself. The doctor, like, scraped out 26 eggs out of my wife’s vagina, like salmon roe. Just scooping out. Just dripping out, and then you put it in some nigiri, right? And then you eat it. That’s how babies are made. You gotta Salt Bae the eggs onto the ikura, and then you eat it. So, uh, we’re trying to make embryos. So, eggs, that’s just half the equation. I don’t know if you know how embryos are made, but eggs, that’s just half of it. She did her part admirably. So now I have to contribute my half of the embryo equation. So I’m sitting in the doctor’s office. [exhales] Like a wet pigeon, all right? And the doctor comes over. And the doctor’s a woman because of course she is. She’s like, “Good morning, Mr. Chieng.” “So, um, when’s the last time you ejaculated?” My wife is right here, and she’s like, “Yeah, when is the last time you ejaculated?”', '[crowd laughing]', '“We would all like to know.” It’s the one time in life where you’re not allowed to lie about jerking off. It’s when a medical professional is asking you a direct question. And it’s for reproduction. It’s for the intended purpose, so you gotta tell the truth. So I’m like, “Whatever, I’ll tell the truth.” “Uh, let me check my calendar, uh…”', '[crowd laughing]', '“I guess the last time I ejaculated was, um…” “Let me see… Uh, yesterday, around 3:00 p.m.”', '[crowd laughing]', 'And my wife is like, “Yesterday… I was with you all day.”', '[crowd laughing]', 'And I was like, “Yeah, but remember when you took out the trash?”', '[crowd laughing]', '[crowd cheering]', 'Because I also put up MVP numbers. Against a shot clock. And heavy defensive pressure. But I was thinking of you the whole time. It’s really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever Vietnamese people eat. My wife is Vietnamese. I’ve no idea what the fuck she eats. Nước mắm. [chuckles] And I went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off. It’s the medical jerking-off room. Every hospital has a medical jerking-off room. Okay? It’s nondescript, not a lot of signage. Smaller than I think it should be. Lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt. And I’m sitting in a medical jerking-off room. By myself. And there’s grown men outside the door, waiting for me to finish…', '[crowd laughing]', '…so they, too, can use the medical jerking-off room that we are sharing like a WeWork.', '[crowd laughing]', 'And I’m in a medical jerking-off room by myself. And… I couldn’t go! Okay? Sorry! Sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand. I’m sorry! Sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me! Sorry! Sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters, as they code to death painfully, and the families crying in the waiting room wasn’t turning me on.', '[crowd laughing]', 'So I couldn’t go. I couldn’t go. So I just call 911, right? I’m like… [chuckles]', '[crowd laughing]', 'I’m like, “These people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room.” Uh, I call the doctor back in, and I’m like, “Doc, I can’t go.” “Okay? I can’t medically ejaculate under these circumstances.” “The vibes are off.” “Let me go home. Let me go home to medically ejaculate. Can I do that?” And the doctor’s like, “Yeah, you can go home, but, you know, as soon as it comes out of your body, it expires quicker than avocados in Hawaii, alright?”', '“You’ve got…”', '[crowd laughing]', '“You have, like, a 45-minute window before there’s like an exponential decreasing probability of…” [gibberish] I’m like, “Okay, fine.” “I’ll go home, I’ll medically ejaculate, I’ll come back in 45 minutes, no problem.” So I go home, open the front door, ejaculate immediately. Alright? This is…', '[crowd laughing]', 'Alright? This is home court advantage. I know where everything is, I know what’s behind me. I look at the dripping garbage bag. [crowd laughing] It’s like a Pavlovian response at this point. Um… I ejaculate into a cup. Okay? It’s a cup that they gave me. It’s not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen.', '[crowd laughing]', 'That says, “World’s Best Dad” on it. [chuckles] It’s the cup that they use… doctors give you to test your pee for drugs. It’s got a really tight cap, right? So, I ejaculate into the cup. It keeps overflowing, so I gotta keep, like, pouring it out.', '[crowd laughing]', 'Just overwhelming amounts.', '[crowd laughing]', 'It’s like Ghostbusters 2 up in here.', '[crowd laughing]', '[chuckling] I fill it to the brim, and then I scrape off the top, and then I… And then I seal the cap as tight as I can, right? Get it really nice and tight. And then I… I put it inside my T-shirt, next to my skin, under my armpit. Nice and snug. Because the doctor told me to do that. Because apparently, like the Titanic, your body heat will keep your people alive. And then I run downstairs, and I jump into a New York City taxi, and I’m like, “Take me to Langone Hospital, please. Hurry up.” The taxi driver is like, “What the fuck are you doing with your hand?” “Are you okay?” I’m like, “Oh, yeah, no, I’m fine.” “No, it’s not me. It’s my… my wife. She’s wait… A person… It’s my jizz.”', '[crowd laughing]', 'And New York City taxis have seen much worse. So, the taxi driver was like, “Oh, okay, cool.” “Thank you for using a cup.” [crowd laughing] “Unlike the last two dudes who were back there.” Just raw dogging at the JFK, you know what I’m saying? And, uh, we get to the… we get to the hospital, right? I open the taxi door. I run into the hospital. And because it’s New York City, someone on the sidewalk is like, “Hey, yo! Hey, yo!” “Were you that guy in Shang-Chi?”', '[crowd laughing]', '“Am I… Yes, I was a minor character in the Marvel movie Shang-Chi, not the main guy.” And the guy’s like, “Yo! Yo! Can I get a photo with you?” And I’m like, “Okay, sure.”', '[crowd laughing]', 'So, we take a photo like this. So, someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger. And I’m doing this. Like Napoleon. If you ever come across this photo, just know I am holding my own jizz.', '[crowd laughing]', 'So feel free to tag it.', '[crowd laughing]', 'He was very grateful. He was like, “Aw, thanks so much, man.” And I was like, “No problem, man.” I shake his hand, right?', '[crowd laughing]', 'Because I love meeting my fans. And I run into the hospital, right? Already hitting the 45-minute mark. End of the fourth quarter. There’s no time left on the clock. So I just take my jizz and I just throw a buzzer-beater. Right?

She just, like, one hand, grabs it, and, like, in the same motion, without even putting it down, she, like, alley-oops my jizz into my wife’s eggs, right? Just takes it, and she goes, “Boom, shaka-laka!” And, uh, my sperm goes into my wife’s eggs, and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg. Nobody knows. It’s a mystery. It’s a mystery of the universe. Nobody knows. When sperm goes into the egg, it’s unknowable. Ooh, it’s… It’s like the event horizon on a black hole. No one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg. Sometimes, nothing happens. When sperm goes into the egg, sometimes, it becomes a bubble tea.', '[crowd laughing]', 'Nobody knows where bubble tea comes from. It’s “tapioca.” The sperm goes into the egg, and then you shake it, and you go to Vegas, you throw it on the crap table… And if you’re lucky, if you get a good dice roll, right? It becomes a blastocyst. That’s what we call future humans, blastocysts. It becomes embryos. The doctor, she’ll take all the embryos and she’ll look at them under the microscope, and she’ll grade the embryos. Like cocaine.', '[crowd laughing]', 'She’ll be like, “Ooh, yeah, these ones?

These are C-grade embryos…” [grumbles] “Oh, and these ones?” “Yeah, these… these are… These are D-grade embryos.” “Yeah, these… These will storm the Capitol someday.” Alright? So…', '[crowd laughing]', 'You don’t want that. And then… [crowd cheering] And then you have to, like, draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics. And you don’t know. You’re just projecting data. You just hope you’re not throwing away a Tom Brady in the 12th round that’s going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you can’t measure the human spirit. And, uh, we all like to think we’re good people in this room, but we’re all picking the A-grade embryos, okay? No one here is not picking your A-grade embryos if given a choice. Even if you were a B-grade embryo.', '[crowd laughing]', 'You would still pick your A-grade embryos. Because you’ll be like, “I know what it’s like.” “I’m not putting my kids through this B-grade human existence, with sweaty palms and sciatica.” [crowd laughing] “Give me the A-grade shit. Give me the best we could do.” “Give my kid a fighting chance.” And it got me thinking about the future a little bit because I never wanted kids. I never thought I would have kids. The only thing I ever wanted to do my whole life was this. Stand-up comedy in America.', '[crowd cheering]', 'It’s the best. Look at this. It’s the best. You are cheering because you know this is way better than having kids.', '[crowd laughing]', '[crowd whooping]', 'So much more fun and lucrative. Well, the blastocysts are real now. There’s eight of them waiting for me in the cloud. Um… 33% chance of successful implantation with grade-A embryos. So, I guess that makes me a mass murderer in Alabama.

Be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck you’re supposed to be now, and… Thinking about it, turns out I’m gonna be just as bad as my parents were. I can… I can feel it.

And then, like 30 seconds into the video, he just, suddenly, just stops. And he looks really sad. And he puts the kettlebell down. And he looks straight into the camera. And he’s like, “Yo, guys, just real talk for a second, all right?” [sniffles] “Kettlebells are great, but I just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind.”', '[crowd laughing]', 'And all the men watching this are like, “Yeah.” [sniffles] “Yeah, that makes sense.” “That feels right, in here.” “Tell me more, kettlebell-swinging guy.”', '[crowd laughing]', '“What other advice do you have for all areas of my life?” “Including my relationships and financial investments.” “Please give me guidance, kettlebell-swinging guy.” So what do you do?

Completely clueless when they go on now.

Let me…” [grunts] Click on this… These fucking internet idiot savants who can’t remember a single goddamn password, but for some reason, can make any piece of misinformation go viral. Like a Russian cyber army, just spreading misinformation around the world in family group WhatsApp chats. Everywhere. “Everybody, just look at this article. Is this real?” “Look at it. Is this real?” It’s how they fact-check! They spread it. “Look at this, this is a real…? Everybody, weigh in.” “I’m not saying a hair dryer in your mouth will kill COVID.” “Okay? But what? You can’t ask questions anymore?” “Look at this article from cnn-n-n-n.ru.” “Quick, send it to your uncle, send it to your…” “Send it to our whole family tree. Everybody needs to see this.” Has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet? I get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last, due to the exponential technology growth curve, okay? But this has got to be the biggest gap in human history! The information asymmetry right now is just out of control. You literally have people in Honolulu right now auto-driving their Tesla Cybertrucks as they vape out the window, and their phone AI is trading cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, you have baby boomers, they can’t even right-click.\", '[crowd laughing]', 'They can’t even right-click. “There’s one button! How do you right-click on one button?!” It’s scary. They don’t know what’s real anymore. “Hey, Ronny. Look at this photo of Bigfoot shopping at Whole Foods.” [crowd laughing] “Bigfoot is real now!” “Look, there’s an image of him buying kombucha at Whole Foods.” “What technology exists that can fake images?” I’m like, “Mom, that’s not real. Stop sending it around. It’s not real.” “How do you know?” They always get so indignant about it. Like, “How do you know that it’s not real?” “How did you know that?” Because the font, the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry, and that lighting state doesn’t make sense for that image! And that’s not standard dimensions for a news article. I can’t give you this knowledge. It’s like Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink! I’ve seen so much shit on the internet, my brain instantly filters it. You’ll never have this skill set, so just stay off the internet! This world is not for you anymore! Stop making decisions! [crowd cheering and clapping] But anyway, respect your elders.', '[crowd laughing]', 'It’s a Confucian value. Maybe if you give your mom some money, she wouldn’t get scammed so much. Yeah, well… Think about the correlation between those two phenomena. Uh… People always ask me, like, “Why do you shit on your mom for money?” “Why don’t you shit on your dad for money?” Alright, uh… [chuckles] No, I don’t talk about my dad because, uh, my dad has no context for show business. Like, we grew up in Malaysia. Like, his families are rubber tappers in Malaysia. My aunts and uncles are still in Sitiawan in Malaysia right now tapping rubber. They have no context for show business. Very smart people, but they don’t know this world. My dad, he was the first guy in his family to get a college education. He went to Manchester College, which has merged with the University of Southern New Hampshire. He got his master’s of economics there. Put himself through it. Very smart guy. And he was a good immigrant. He came to America, to New Hampshire, to get his education, and when he graduated, he went back to Malaysia. He didn’t take anyone’s job, he left.', '[crowd laughing]', 'And my dad had the vision to see what I didn’t see. He knew he had a ceiling on him, because of the way he thinks and talks, and he went back to Malaysia. And he was right! For him. He went back. It was the right choice for him. He became a very successful corporate executive. Uh, he retired to a farm in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Love farming. He retired to a farm. That’s how much this guy loved it, but he had no context for show business, so he wouldn’t understand anything I’m doing. Like, he wouldn’t understand what I’m doing in Godzilla vs. Kong. He’d be like, “Why don’t you just run that way?”', '[crowd laughing]', '“Dad, I don’t control the edit. Okay?” “I’m just Honolulu Chinatown shopkeeper No. 3 in this…” “In this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla, okay?” “I’m just connecting Act 1 to Act 2, I don’t have a say in how this plays out.” Because of that, I stopped telling him about what I was doing. I felt he wouldn’t get it, and he stopped asking me. So I didn’t tell him I got hired on The Daily Show. He found out the way all parents find out about their kids’ accolades, through a local newspaper. So, one day, the local paper reported that I got hired on The Daily Show, and he called me immediately. He was like, Ronny, what’s this I hear about you joining “The Everyday Show”? And I was like, “Oh no, it’s The Daily Show.” “I joined like two years ago, Dad.” He was like, “Oh, okay. Well, what’s The Daily Show?” I’m like, “It’s just like another late-night American talk show.” “They kind of invented modern American satire.” And… [clicks tongue] And, uh, my dad was like, “Oh, that’s cool. Are you the host?” I’m like, “No, I’m a correspondent.” He was like, “What is that? What’s a correspondent?” I’m like, “Yeah, correspondent is, I help the host with comedy segments.” And he was like, “Oh, okay.” “Hey, Mei! He’s just a sidekick.”', '[crowd laughing]', 'And so he had, like, no context for what was a win, what was a milestone in this industry. And so, I stopped telling him, and he stopped asking me. And I didn’t need that from him. We… We were totally fine. We’d talk about other stuff. Not about work. We weren’t fighting. It was all good. Uh, and he passed away very suddenly, uh, in 2018. He died on Christmas Eve. Died on his farm, like, no warning, no explanation. He just left one day. He left so suddenly, we had to go back to handle his estate. If anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position, when you have to handle someone else’s estate, it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life. And so it’s me, my wife, my sister, brother-in-law, went back to Johor Bahru, and part of me trying to figure out his estate was I had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using. So, his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it, and I opened it up, and it’s password-protected, and I know this guy so well, I’m like, “His password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child.” So…', '[crowd laughing]', '…I type in my sister’s birthday, and spot on. Spot on. It was my sister’s birthday.', '[crowd laughing]', 'As it should be. She’s, like, an anesthesiologist in Australia. She’s like way more respectable person than me, actually saving lives like a good person. Contributing back to society, not like this fucking asshole. I get in… [chuckles] I get in trouble on the internet for shit I said two years ago, every six weeks. So it should be her. She should be the favorite. So, I log into his computer, I open his web browser, I look at his browsing history, and the whole time, I’m like, “Please don’t let me find my dad’s porn.” “Please don’t let me find what positions my dad was into.” “Even if it was just missionary, I wouldn’t be able to handle it.” “I’m gonna have to burn this laptop.” For real Chinese people, when we burn things, it goes to our ancestors, and then my granddad is gonna see it, and it’s like, I don’t… I don’t want that for them. I’ll be fine, but they’re gonna have an awkward time. I’m considerate like that, uh… So I open the web browser, look at his history, and way to go, Dad, no porn. What a clean-cut guy. No porn. He only went on the internet twice a day. Like clockwork. 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Like the farmer that he was. And every time he went on the internet, he’d only go to two websites each time. So, the first website he’d go to was a local news website, and the second website he’d go to twice a day, every single day, was my Twitter page. [crowd] Aw… So, he’d be reloading my Twitter page twice a day just to see what I was doing. And I post stuff like, “Hey, Honolulu, Hawaii, I sold out five shows, uh, this week, why’s there so many homeless people here?” I’d post stuff like that.', '[crowd laughing]', 'And, uh… he would read that, and then he’d be like… I assume, he’d be like, “Oh, Ronny’s doing okay.” “He’s in Hawaii, he sold out some shows, and oh, I guess there’s a lot of homeless people in Hawaii.” Uh, and, um, that was his quiet way of keeping up with me. He never told me that, and I never knew that, and we never discussed it, um, which is a very nice sentiment. Unfortunately, uh, as best as I can tell, this is the last tweet my dad read of mine. [crowd laughing] So, as best as I can tell, forensically, based on internet browsing timestamps, the last tweet my dad read of mine, and quite possibly, the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm, was me posting on Twitter, “If you’re a baby boomer on Twitter, I already know you’re a fucking loser.”', '[crowd laughing]', 'Now, obviously, this was not directed towards him. I didn’t even know he had Twitter. I didn’t even know he knew what Twitter was. But I stand by the statement.', '[crowd laughing]', '[applause]', 'And I know that’s kind of a weird way to end the show, but, um…', '[crowd laughing]', '[chuckles] …if it’s any solace, uh, this was his phone when he died. [crowd] Aw! That was his, uh, wallpaper and his screensaver. And… [chuckles] And I didn’t even know. And it’s a photo of me and my wife, and we’re in Hawaii. And I’m wearing two leis ’cause my mom threw one off and I put it on.', '[crowd laughing]', 'And, uh, I didn’t know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper. Uh, and… [applause] Uh… I… I like to… I like to think that, uh, that is the last image he saw of me. That’s what he remembered me by when he left.

He jokes about the quirks of parenting, the decline of physical abilities, and communication mishaps with his wife, all while highlighting the universal truth that life, like rice pudding, always comes with a few unwanted raisins.

I don’t get it. Because, first of all, you’re not fooling anybody, okay? But even if you do, you’re not really helping yourself because people can see you.

[AUDIENCE TITTERS] Okay. Your next thought would have to be, “You don’t look good.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “That’s a tired-ass-looking 35-year-old. That’s…” Right.

He likes to pretend the last three decades never happened. He just lives in a fairy… And it’s embarrassing. We go out to dinner, and he’s… He’s flirting with every cute waitress. “How are you doing, darling?” I go, “What are you doing? Jackass, what are you doing?” [AUDIENCE TITTERS] He said, “No, I’m not gonna do anything. “I just… I just want to see if I still got it.” And I tell him, “You don’t.

As you get older, do you find you get hurt in ways you didn’t used to get hurt. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] I injured myself doing something stupid. Which, by the way, that is the number one cause of injury in this country, is doing something stupid. You ask anybody how they got hurt, I guarantee you the first thing they’ll tell you, “Yeah, it was so stupid.” It’s like, “Yeah, of course.” Right? Because nobody gets hurt doing anything smart. You’ve never heard of that. “I was working on algorithms for the space program, “and my brain just caved in, “and that’s why I look like this. I was so smart.” No, it’s always stupid.

At a certain age, don’t help anybody move a couch. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You just leave it or get a young person. There’s no reason for you to get involved. I didn’t even think about it. My friend said, “You wanna grab that? “We want to scooch it back.” So I lift, and just as I lift it, I heard a pop in my arm. I said, “Whoa, that’s not good.”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'There shouldn’t be noise in my shirt. Anybody hear that?', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]', 'It really hurt. But then 10 seconds later, it didn’t hurt.

[AUDIENCE TITTERS] The whole… The muscle… It’s not like a big muscle. I’m not trying to show off. I’m just saying, whatever sad, pathetic muscle I had, fell. It just fell. So instead of being like a gradual little mound, it was a puny hill gathered at the bottom. It was just… It didn’t hurt, but it looked wrong. So I said, “I’ve got to get this fixed.” So I had to find a surgeon. Orthopedic surgeon. My friend says, “I got the guy for you. “I got the guy. I got the guy. Don’t even look around.” He said, “I got the guy, my guy, I got the best guy. “My guy is the best.” Do you ever notice, all your friends always have the best guy. Nobody has the seventh best dentist. You’ve never heard that.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I have the 35th best proctologist.” No, they’re all the best. They can’t all be the best. Like my regular doctor, my checkup guy, he’s not the best. I know that. He’s… And I’m fine with it. He’s okay. He’s like… He’s in the top 20 in his building, I would imagine. You know, he’s fine. He’s fine.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'He’s is not a particularly great doctor, but he’s got terrific parking, and I love that. The in and out of there.

He’s very thorough. Great guy, great guy.” And then he says, “And he’s really handsome.” I’m like, “Okay.” It’s not something I generally look for when choosing a medical practitioner, but whatever. Okay. So I go. They put me in a little examination room, and I’m there 10 minutes by myself. Door opens, doctor walks in, Guy was really handsome. I’m not gonna lie to you.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'Even with my friend’s warning, I was still a little thrown. Like, “Whoa, look at you.” “Hang on, look at you. That’s a good-looking guy. “Look at this guy with a square jaw and a full head of hair. “That’s a good-looking guy.” It struck me, “That shouldn’t be.” If you’re already the top surgeon in the country, you don’t get to be good-looking, too. That’s not right.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'Pick one or the other. That’s not how this works. Pick one or the other.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]', 'It’s like sometimes, you meet somebody and they’re really attractive, and then they turn out to be stupid. You go, “Fair enough. Okay.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Pick one. But this guy, he was great. He was very thorough. He did an MRI, did an X-ray. He said, “You know, well, you did some damage.” He said, he goes, “You have a little tear in your rotator cuff.” He said, “But that’s not your big problem.” He said, “Your big problem…” I said, “I know, I’m emotionally unavailable.” He said… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Perhaps it’s not my area. He said, “Your your big problem,” get ready, he said, “Your bicep is partially detached.” I said, “Hang on, Doc, I gotta throw up a little bit.”', '[GAGS]', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I said, “Why would you say that?” He goes, “I see it all the time.” I said, “All right, so what do we do now? A little surgery?” He says, “Well, you can, “but you don’t have to.” I said, “What does that mean?” He said, “Well, the best I can do is I’m gonna bring you back “to where you were before you hurt yourself.” He said, “But you’re telling me you can do everything.” I said, “Yeah, I’ve got full range of motion.” He says, “All right, and you’re not in any pain?” I said, “No, there’s no pain.” And he says, “Yeah, so, “I would just leave it.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I said is, “Is that where I’m at? “Are we already there? Is that what’s happening?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “We’re just gonna run down the clock now? “Is that what we’re doing?” [LAUGHING] “Just leave it.” Oh, my God. If I was real estate, I’m not even a fixer-upper, I’m a tear-down. Just stick it out as long as you can, but I wouldn’t put more money into it at this point.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'He said, “I can hear you when you say that.” [AUDIENCE TITTERS] I said, “No, we’re gonna do the surgery, Dr. Handsome, “and I’ll tell you why.” I said, “We’re gonna do it, because if we don’t, “I think that sends the wrong message “to all the other parts that are still working.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I mean, they see a tendon float by, they go, “Look at this. He doesn’t even give a shit anymore. “The whole place is falling apart. “Why should we pump blood to his heart? “He’s not gonna be around,” you know. So I did the surgery, and I’m happy to report that after months of rehab and thousands of dollars, he was able to make me exactly as weak as I was right before.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'So there you go. That’s right.', '[AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING]', 'Thank you for applauding my slow demise. But I have much to be grateful for. I have my health, such as it is, and I have my family, I have… A little bit about myself, my wife and I, we have two boys, one of whom I don’t care for. And I’m just… To be honest.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I’m just being honest with you. You know, I love him. Don’t get me wrong. I love him, but you know… You know how some kids, they just know how to push your buttons, and they just know how to say the wrong thing. So my younger son, he’s 23. Twenty-four, if we pick up the option, and I don’t know that we will.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'But he’ll just come over and he’ll go, “Dad, can I say something to you, no offense?” And I go, “I doubt it.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “That has not been my experience with you thus far.” Right, because nobody ever says, “No offense” unless they’re about to offend you. They just let you know it’s coming, and they don’t care. They don’t care. It’s like when people say, “You know, I don’t want to sound racist…” “Well, then stop talking. Why don’t you stop right there?', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“Just don’t say it. “Don’t say it, because even you have a hunch “it’s not good, don’t you? Yeah. “So maybe don’t say it. “Because if you say it, “I’ll have to think you’re a racist. No offense.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] No offence. I mean, you know… No, listen, we all want to be terrific parents. We want… We aspire to be great parents. But if we’re being honest, we’re all winging it. We don’t know what the hell we’re doing. None of us know what… But if there’s one skill… If there’s one skill that you need to be an efficient parent, you have to worry. That’s the main thing.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'You have to worry. I don’t judge anybody, but if you have kids and you’re not worried, I don’t think you’re doing it right. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You have to worry. I’m not saying do anything, but just worry. Start there. It’s an important skill to have. And not to brag, I’m very good at it. I’m very good at worrying. Even if there’s nothing to worry about, I’ll make something up. I don’t care. I do. I’ll lie in bed, make up lists, come up with lists like “Ways to get hurt “I had not thought of previously.” [AUDIENCE TITTERS] And by way, all the things I worry about, They never happen. They never happen. Nobody’s ever gotten their head stuck in a lawnmower. Okay, but I thought of it.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'It could have happened. Nobody ever reached into a dryer to pull out socks, fell in and ended up drying to death. That’s not the thing. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You know, and I’ve been around long enough to know that worrying, it doesn’t help. It doesn’t prevent anything, right? It doesn’t even… It doesn’t even prepare us for anything. But still, we prepare. I know I prepare. If I’m on a plane and we hit a little turbulence, you know, the five seconds where you think you’re going down, I prepare by doing this.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'Because this is really all the insulation you need upon impact. This is… That way, if the plane does go down and I’m the sole survivor, I can tell everybody, “You know what kept me alive. “I had my fists balled up very, very tight. “And to be honest, my asshole was clenched shut… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “…like a bank vault on a Sunday.” That puppy was closed for business. Nobody getting in or out of there. That was closed. “So when we hit, I just bounced right up. “That’s what happened. There I was. “I’m the only one. We hit a… Pow. Bounced right up.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I was saved by the grace of God and just the the sheer rigidity of my own sphincter.', 'That’s what did it. Pow.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I told you this would not be important, didn’t I? [LAUGHING] It has been a crazy year. Well, for everybody. But let’s, let’s focus on me. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] A lot of upheaval in my family. We moved. We moved this year, and the kids found us. That was surprising. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I did not anticipate that kind of follow-through. No, we moved. It was a big deal for the kids because we had been in this house for 20 years. So their whole childhood was in this house. And here’s what I learned. You know, you cannot sell your house until you fix it up.', 'Did you know that?', '[AUDIENCE TITTERS]', 'Because nobody in their right minds is gonna buy your house after what you and the kids have done to the place, living like animals all these years.', 'No, new people deserve better, don’t they?', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'All the things that never bothered you enough to fix while you lived there, you’re gonna snap to it for these next imaginary people so they shouldn’t have to live like monkeys in a pile of their own filth.', '[AUDIENCE TITTERS]', 'So we got to work. We steamed the furniture, cleaned the carpets, painted the walls outside, new shrubs, new hedges, new grass, new flowers. Suddenly, I looked around and went, “This place looks great.', '[AUDIENCE TITTERS] “Boy, I wish we lived here. This is…” [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] I’ll tell you, it’s not until you move and you start opening cabinets and closets, it’s not until then that you realize just how much crap…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '…you have accumulated. You shouldn’t have to move just to get rid of crap. You know, we could, theoretically, get rid of a little crap every once in a while, and whittle it down. But that’s not the way crap works.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]', 'No, crap likes to stay out of sight where it grows in the dark. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] Just as your family has grown over the years, so has your crap. That’s kind of… If you think about it, it’s kind of the arc of life. First half of life, we’re just getting stuff, get stuff. You can’t get enough stuff. Get stuff. Get to a certain age, get rid of that stuff, get rid of that stuff, get rid… That’s the roller coaster of life. Accumulate, shed. Accumulate, and then shed. We accumulate things and people. We accumulate people. When you’re young, you can’t meet enough people. Right? You mean a nice couple, “We should get their number. I like them. “We should be friends with them. “And their other friends, I like them, too. Get their number. “We’ll all get together. The six of us, we’ll have dinner. “And if that goes well, we’ll get an RV, “I think we’ll all go cross country.', '“I think… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I have a good feeling about these people.” You can’t get enough. And then you get to a certain age, you go the other way. All these people that you were so eager to meet, Now, “You know what? I don’t want to see these people anymore.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“I’m tired of these people. I can’t do it. “I’m tired of these people. Should we get new people? “No, I’m saying, no more people. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “No more people. That’s what I’m saying. “No more people. Just you and me. “That’s how it’s gonna be. Just you and me. “And frankly, some days, I would whittle that list down further. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Let’s let’s try you and me.” We all have too many friends. How many friends do you need, really? Three? I’m gonna say three. If you have three good friends, consider yourself blessed. And the others, cut ’em. Just let ’em go.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'It’s just too much work. You know, everything, you have to reciprocate. “Oh, they invited us, now we gotta invite them. “They sent us a thing, “all right, we gotta send them a thing. Just cut ’em. And, by the way, they’ll thank you. They were gonna cut you, just so you understand. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So it’s a win-win. But don’t cut them all. You need three. You definitely need three, and I’ll tell you why. Friends do serve a certain function, so you need one friend… You need one friend just to agree with you how horrible the other friends are. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That’s one. Then you need one friend… This is really important. You need one friend whose children are more troubled than yours. That’s so important.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'You’ve got to find that family. It’s not nice… I’m not saying… But it’s so important, ’cause you just feel better about yourself, don’t you? “You know what, honey? Our kids are lazy and stupid.” “Yeah, okay. But that kid’s out of his fucking mind.', '“That kid’s a nut.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“That kid’s nuts. “Oh, those poor people. “Yes, we should count our blessings “with these two idiots because that’s…', '“That’s no way to live.”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'So that’s two. And then the third, in case once in a while, you need a ride to the airport.', 'But that’s like…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'And the rest, cut ’em. Cut ’em. You don’t need ’em. But that’s what this point in life is about. Just shed, shed. We accumulate, and then we shed. There’s a third stage. Very tiny, short, brief stage at the top of that curve, when you have just the right number of people, just the right number of things, but you don’t know it. You don’t know it till you go past it. Amazon drops off some crap you didn’t even know you ordered, and you’re going, “What is this, sweetie? An avocado pit remover. “Why? Why?” “We’ll be having difficulty removing the pits from the avocado.” You don’t want it, but you have it, so you throw it in the drawer, and that’s what breaks you. A week later, you put your house on the market.', 'That’s why one piece of crap too many.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And then it’s time to downsize. So now how do you get rid of your crap? I’m gonna tell you. Three piles. That’s the answer. Everything you have goes into one of three piles. Garbage pile, save pile, and then the biggest one, not sure pile.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And that’s the Holy Trinity of downsizing. Garbage, save, not sure. Now start with the garbage pile, and you’ll notice you’ve got a problem, because not everything in the garbage pile is actually garbage. Some of it still works.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Those are the two words that have kept this crap in your life year after year.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'You thought about throwing it out. [EXCLAIMS] “Still works. “Maybe I’ll put it back and let it die a natural death. “I don’t want to rush it. It’s still… “You know, this Sony Walkman cassette player. This… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I know we don’t use cassettes, and we never will, “but if we did, this is REO Speedwagon. “Listen to that. It’s still going. “It’s still going.” “You know, this electric blanket, “I know the kids are grown, and this is a ratty, “disgusting, fiery death trap, “but you know what? That still… Wow. “That’s still working. Look at that.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So what do you do? What do you do? You have something that still works, but you don’t want to… Have a garage sale, right? Have a yard sale. People enjoy it. Personally, I can’t do it. I can’t do it. It takes a certain type of balls. It takes a certain magnitude of moxie to look a stranger in the eye, and just tell him, “I don’t want this crap anymore, “but you might.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“Take a look. All my crap could be your crap like that.” So I can’t do that. But you can always find somebody who can use it. You go, “Hey, you know what, the neighbor’s kid “just got his first apartment. “Give him that lamp. The lamp. “I know it’s ugly, and the base is wobbly, “and the neck is hanging by a thread, “but it still works. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Kid’s not gonna want to sit in the dark. Give him a lamp.” Here’s the problem there. Kid could get insulted. Kid go, “You giving me this? It’s a piece of crap.”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'And you have to go, “I know. “That’s why I’m giving it to you. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I’m not gonna give you the good stuff. “I’m giving you the crap.” On the other hand, it could go the other way. Kid might go, “You’re getting rid of this?” “Oh, I love this. Thanks.” And that’s where you’ll go, “You know what? Let me have that back. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I was on the fence, to be honest, “but when I saw your enthusiasm, “I realized I was a bit hasty.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But one way or another, whether you throw it out, give it away, donate it, the garbage pile goes away. Save pile, that’s very simple. Just put everything in a box, kick it down the road, you’ll deal with it next time you move, or just wait till you’re dead, and the kids can fight over who wants it less.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'Then you get to the mother lode, the not sure pile. This is where a lot of marriages and mental health go to die. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Because there are a lot of decisions. And what is in there? What is it that we’re so not sure about? It’s always sentimental stuff, right? You open the closet, “Oh, look, “the kids’ finger paintings from kindergarten. [EXCLAIMING] “the diorama of the Navajo Village “from second grade that we did all the work on, “if I remember correctly.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“We can’t throw that out.” “No, throw it out. This is not what you want to take “into the next chapter of your life. “Throw it. It has no value.” The only value is in that second when you find it, you go, [WAILS] and then throw it the fuck out. You don’t want it. You don’t want it.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'Don’t put it back. It won’t increase in value. It’s not a Picasso, okay?', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'The hardest part, when I got to my crap, I could not believe what I had been dragging with me for decades.', '[AUDIENCE TITTERS]', 'I had boxes of crap… Started in my parents’ house. When I got my first apartment, I put a bunch of crap in a box, whole bunch of boxes, took ’em with me to my apartment. Never opened it. Didn’t need to. Moved from New York, moved out to California, Crap came with me. Now I have California crap. Okay. Got married, got a house. Now I got a… Crap is in the house. We got kids, needed more room, crap went into storage, now it’s back. I don’t know how that happened, but here it is. So now we’re downsizing, and we have to finally open these hermetically sealed time capsules. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And what have I been dragging around with me for 50 years? I go, “Ah, look, my Little League trophy. “‘Fifth place. Nice effort.’ Look at that, sweetie.”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING]', 'Yes. “Your husband made a nice effort in 1968. “I don’t think you were aware of that. “You’re married to quite the athlete. You don’t know…” Then went, “Ah, look, my book report from 4th grade. “Huckleberry Finn. I got an A++. “Maybe the kids would enjoy reading…” No, they don’t. Let me help you. They don’t. They don’t. They never will. You don’t want your crap. Imagine how much your kids don’t want your crap. Because kids are not nostalgic, you know. Kids have not been around long enough to nostalge. They don’t have that. Kids are looking forward. Kids are all about the future, whereas you have very limited future. Let’s be honest.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'No, I don’t care how old you are, what kind of shape you’re in, I’m just saying, every day, less future. You understand this, right?', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I can’t be the first person explaining this to you. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Every day, less future. If you think I’m lying, tomorrow morning, look at your calendar. “He was right. One day less.” There’s less. And they’re not making more. This is it, folks. This is it. So, you know, use it wisely. For God’s sake, don’t do what I did. Don’t waste your precious remaining days going through boxes of letters from girls who broke up with you in 10th grade, that you’ve been saving in the off chance that maybe they’ll rethink it…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '…and come crawling back. Like they’re gonna show up at my door now, “Why did I ever break up with you in 1973?” You can pull out the letter. “Does that ring a bell, sweetheart?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, that ship has sailed. You’re all… You’re married, she’s married. Plus, you’re both old. You know what? It’s not that… What you remember is not how it is. The cute girl that you remember from the high school yearbook with the tight jeans and the perky sweater, she’s now a 68-year-old grandmother of five, okay?', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'She has an arthritic hip, she doesn’t hear in one ear, and you, I think we know what’s happened with you, so… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Move on. This is what I’m telling you people. Move on. Let it go. You ever bump into somebody that you haven’t seen, like since high school? That can be a jolt. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] That’s a jolt, because, you know, we only remember people the way we last saw them. We don’t extrapolate over time. So I had a… I did a show back east. I was in New York, I did a show. After the show, a woman came… Lovely woman, maybe 70, came over, she said to me, “You went to college in Binghamton, New York.” I said, “Yes, I did.” She said, “Do you remember a girl, Debbie Miller?” I said, “Oh, yeah, absolutely. Is that your daughter?”', 'She went, “No, it’s me.” I went…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“I don’t think so. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “That’s not how I remember it at all. “I happen to have the yearbook right here. “Let me show you. Here. You look like that. “What has happened to you? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “No, me, I have mirrors in my house. “I’m not shocked anymore. But you…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“I turn my back for, what, 50 years, “and you let this happen. Why?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I don’t make fun of anybody. It’s not… Listen, I am not perfect. I-I am not perf… You know, when you pay with a credit card while it’s reading the chip, it says, “Do not remove”? Sometimes I remove. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Just being honest. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] I don’t know why they care so much. What if I remove it? Who am I hurting? I’ll put it back. It’s not a big… What? There’s no lying. I’m the only one here. I’m gonna put it in. I’ll take it out. I’ll put it back. Who cares? I don’t know why they… I’ve gotten very skeptical of any kind of… Any kind of, you know, notice, or… I got a thing on my phone the other day, those updates, “Your data storage cloud “is completely filled.” And my brain went straight to, “Is it, though? Is it, really? Is it?”', '[AUDIENCE TITTERS]', '“Oh, yes, it is filled. “That’s why we’re reaching out. It is totally filled.” “That’s weird, because I never put anything in the cloud.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Well, be that as it may, “it’s stuffed. It is totally stuffed. “Shit’s falling out of your cloud. “I hate to tell you, the other clouds “have been mentioning it because it’s not pretty, what’s happening.', '“It’s just disgusting up there.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“It’s coming out of your cloud.” “Can I see the cloud?” “No. Nobody sees the cloud. “Nobody not no-how. “But it is stuffed. “That’s why we’re… I’ll tell you what, though, “for $999, I can get you a bigger cloud. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “You’re gonna like this cloud. “You can’t see this one either, but trust me, it’s the el grande. I don’t trust these people. I don’t trust them. And by the way, they don’t trust us. They don’t trust us. How many times have you gone on a website and they don’t even believe that you’re a human being?', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', \"And they have to screen you. “Are you a robot? “We won’t be mad, just be… Honestly, are you a robot?” “Let me ask you, if I was a robot, “why would I tell you? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Doesn’t that kind of defeat the whole purpose of being a robot?” Because robots are not stupid, you know. We program robots to do a lot of smart things. I’ll bet you, with a little extra effort, we could teach them to lie. It’s not that hard. Just type it in. “If they ask, ‘Are you a robot?’ “You say, ‘No.'” You can even program a little attitude. “Do I look like a fucking robot?” You know, why couldn’t they do that?\", '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'Okay. Okay. But they’re expecting that. They’re ready for the lying robots. That’s why they always have that second-tier test, the little picture test with the eight pictures. “Which picture has a school bus, or a chimney, or a crosswalk, or a palm tree? You would think that’s easily within the realm of what a robot could do, right? No, they can’t. They’re stuffed, they stymied by the picture test. They get that far, and then they go… [EXCLAIMS] We don’t know what that is! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It’s yellow and big and… Ah, we gotta go back. Can’t do it. They cannot do it. Whereas I, not to brag, am very good at these tests. I, I…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I am. I get them all right every time. I’m very good at it. I can… School bus, school bus, not a school bus, not a school bus, school bus, not a school bus, not a school bus. Give me another one. Come on. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, I know I’m already in, but I’m enjoying myself. Keep them coming.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'What have you got? All right, chimney, chimney, not a chimney, not a chimney, chimney, chimney, not a chimney. Crosswalk, crosswalk, little piece of a crosswalk. That counts. Crosswalk, little crosswalk, no crosswalk. But they’re not always easy. Sometimes, they try to trip you up. Palm tree, palm tree. Well, it could be a ficus. You know what? Hang on.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I don’t know how specific they want to be with the trees. You know, I figured out why I love these tests so much. I’m just so happy to be asked something I know. Because there’s so much I don’t know. Because the brain can only handle so much. There’s a certain point in life, there’s not much that can get in there. You know, all these things that I’m talking about as we age, they don’t all happen at one time, which… That would be nice. If they gave you a date, and they said, here’s your old person date, and then you can prepare, and that’s the day when everything just goes bad. But they don’t do it like that. They just eat, get out… it’s like a slow drip. Every week, I notice something new that worked better a few weeks ago. Like… the last couple of years, I was squinting a lot. My eyes were… I was squinting. Recently, I noticed I’m going the other way. Just whoa… Whoa… Opening my eyes wide. This isn’t working. That’s got to do it. I’ll throw more vision at the problem.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I’ll will it into focus. First time I noticed, I was on my computer, and I realized I was making the font a little bigger every week. First time you go from a 12 to 14, it’s like night and day. You go, “that’s fantastic.” Why didn’t I do this years ago? This is fantastic. But then it’s like crack. You can’t get enough.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'You go, 18 is even better than 14. Look at that! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You know what? 24. Nothing to be embarrassed about 36. That, then, oh, that’s… 48. Pretty damn good. I mean like… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] I’m at 157, and honestly, just… You can read it from out of town. That’s how big the… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I had to get reading glasses. Never had reading glasses. Took them home, Still couldn’t really make out the computer. I called the eye doctor. I said, “These glasses are not really working. “The computer is still blurry.” He said, “Oh, did you want computer glasses?”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'You told me you wanted reading glasses. I said, “What?” He said, yeah, those are two different focal lengths. Reading your book is six to eight inches from the eye. A computer is generally 12 to 14 inches from the eye. I said, “Yeah, but, you could move the computer.” He said, “But you won’t.” I said, “That’s so true.” He said, “I’ll give you another pair. “Use that for six to eight, “use the other pair for 12 to 14.” I said, “Let me ask you this. “What if there’s something in the middle?” And he said, “Don’t look at it. “What do you want me to tell you?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] He said, “Nine, ten, eleven inches. “That’s going to be a dead zone. I’ll tell you right now.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I can help you up to eight or after 12. “In the middle, you’re on your own. “Nothing I can do. “If anybody approaches in that area, tell them, “move up or move back. But don’t hover.” So I got reading glasses. I have computer glasses. I have driving glasses. I have driving at night glasses. If I’m in my house, and I wanna look out the window, separate for glasses for that.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I got like 14 pairs of glasses now. I’m solid. I got all the glasses I need. Problem is, my brain is fading. I don’t know where the glasses are. So… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] So they’re not helping. They’re not helping. And I had heard about that… short-term memory. They always tell you, as you get older, your short-term memory will diminish. So, I was anticipating a little hit to the short-term memory. What I didn’t understand was just how short… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …the term is. It’s a short term.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I was talking to my friend. I said, “Hey, this trip you’re going on? “Is that for business? Are you going just for fun?” He said, “Oh, the latter.” And I went… “I don’t remember what order I just said it.”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]', 'I just said it! That’s not a memory. That’s now. That’s short-term now. I’m losing my now. I don’t remember anything anymore. But I’m honest about it. I tell people right up front, as they’re talking to me, I will tell them, “Hey, just so you understand, “this is the same as if you weren’t talking to me, “okay? Just…”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]', '“No, I can hear you, and it’s nice to see you, “but it’s not going in. That’s what I’m saying. “If it’s important, write it down. “Wait, you know what? Tell my wife. “But I’m telling you, I can’t hold it. “I have maxed out. My cloud is totally filled. “I cannot… “It cannot go in there.” Sometimes I do remember what people tell me, but… then I don’t know who told it to me. That’s the thing. I spend a lot of my life going, “Who was I talking to? “Who was I talking to? “I was just talking about that. “Yes, the zebra that exploded in the zoo. “We were talking… Who was I talking to? “I heard… who was I talking to?” That’s why it’s great. If you’re married, if you have a… If you’re in a couple, if you’re married, you’re in a couple, you have a built-in backup system, 24-7. You just go, “Honey, who were we talking to about the zebra? “Huh? Who were… You weren’t there?”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“Who was I talking to? Do you have any idea?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Where have I been the last four or five days? “Any recollection?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] “Who could I have been talking to? That’s what I’m trying to get… “Throw some names at me, I’ll see if anything rings a bell.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Are you not keeping track? “Remember, I asked you to keep a list of where I go, “and who I talked to? Yes, I did. “I asked… I didn’t ask you? I asked somebody. “Who was I talking to? “I could have sworn that was you.” And again, see, we know these things are gonna happen. We’ve seen it happen with other people. So we know it’s coming, but we don’t know when. We don’t even know in what sequence these things will happen. So, right now, at this point, I’m just on constant lookout, waiting to see which bodily function goes south next. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And I had a frightening moment. I was driving, and I accidentally, with my elbow, I hit the… little dial for the seat heater. So, the pinholes are shooting up heat. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But I didn’t know that I did anything. Do you understand? So, I’m driving, I’m minding my own business, and just all of a sudden… Hmmm…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]', 'This is new. This is new.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]', 'I just noticed, from the waist down, everything was hot. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] It was like a general hotness in the bottom half of me. And my first thought… I’m not proud of this… but my first thought was… I think I just shit myself. Yep. Make a note, sweetie. Today’s the day it started. I…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]', 'Hmm? No, I don’t feel sick at all. That’s what’s surprising. No, I… No, I didn’t eat anything out of the ordinary! You were with me the whole… you saw, I was just sitting here, driving, and… dropped a load. I don’t know how to put it to you, but… We’re going to pull over, change my pants, and get a new car, because we can’t live like this. We cannot live like this. These are just some of the wonderful highlights we can look forward to on our journey. But I’ll tell you, you know, if you’re lucky enough, and you have the right partner on your journey, it makes the whole trip a lot more manageable, and a lot more entertaining. If you’re lucky enough to have the right partner, and… Right? It helps. It helps. And I have to say, I am very, very lucky. I married a wonderful woman… initially, but you know what?', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'No, let me finish. Let me… Here’s how hard marriage is. I absolutely married the perfect woman. She’s beautiful, she’s intelligent, she’s independent, she’s successful, she’s kind-hearted, she’s a great mother, and we’re perfectly matched! We had the same values, the same taste, same sense of humor, same everything. Couldn’t be more perfectly matched for each other. And still… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] With all that, three out of five days, I’m slamming my head against a wall. So that’s how hard it is. I have a friend who’s not married. He’s like in his 50s. Not married, never been married, and he’s never going to be married. And the reason I know that, is he tells me all the time, defiantly, “I’ll never get married.” He says, “I don’t care what you say, Paul. “I will never get married.” And I tell him, “I don’t care.”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I said I don’t get a commission. You understand that? I… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I don’t work for the organization. Just had the little TV show. That was the whole extent of it. I’m not involved. He said, but… He’s mystified by my… [CHUCKLING] …marriage. He said, “How do you do it? “How do you stay with one woman your whole life? “What’s the secret?” I said what do I know? I said, I don’t know a secret. I said, I’ve only been married one time to one woman. I said, and by the way, in all that time, I’ve only learned one thing, if I’m being honest, I said, and I’ll give it to you. If it helps, I’ll share it with you. This is what I told him. This is the only thing I know to be true. I said to him, I said, [HESITATES] …when you’re with a woman, sometimes, you’re going to want to say something. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …if a little voice in your head says, “I wouldn’t say it now…”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '…you want to listen to the voice. That’s all I can tell you. It’s there to help you. You may have a question, and it can be a perfectly reasonable question. But if you hear a voice say, “All right, but I wouldn’t ask it right now,” trust the voice. That’s why it’s there. You’ll never regret it. Nobody gets to the end of their life and goes, “Oh, if only I could ask more irritating shit, “I could have, I could have… “I had the opportunity, and then I didn’t do it.” No. Because by the way, even if what you want to say is sweet, and loving, and wonderful, it can come out wrong…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '…as I have learnt. So, okay, this happened. The other day, I had a really, a lovely moment. I was watching my wife in the house, and I just… was watching her, and I was overcome with a really wonderful feeling of appreciation and affection and gratitude. I was just watching her, “I’m going, God, am I lucky!” I said, “What a wonderful… I’m so lucky. “I married such a wonderful woman.” And I said, “Boy, she does a thousand things a day “that we don’t even know about “that just keep the trains running, “and make our lives great. “And she does… She does everything for us. “And boy, God forbid, something ever happened to her, “I’d be lost. I wouldn’t know how to go on. “My life would be empty and hollow without her.” This is what I’m thinking. My wife sees me staring at her oddly. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She said, ‘What?” Here’s what came out of my mouth. “Nothing. I was just picturing if you were dead…”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]', '[MOUTHING INDISTINCTLY] You see what I’m saying? That’s not reflective at all! Um, what I… You see that! It’s very hard to clean that one up, I’ll be honest. But you learn, you learn over time. There are certain things you can only learn in a long-term relationship. I have learned… Okay, here’s an example. So when we’re sleeping, my wife, who I adore, just so we’re clear, when we’re sleeping, she doesn’t snore, because women don’t snore. I understand. I understand. Having said that, there is a noise, uh… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …coming out of this area of her. There is a noise that, if you didn’t know better, you’d go, “That sounds like snoring.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And I actually kind of, I don’t mind it. I find it endearing. For the first few minutes, anyway, I just marvel. I go, “Really?”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“Really, a face that beautiful “could make a sound that atrocious. “That doesn’t seem possible.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But after a few minutes, you want to go to sleep. So here’s what I’ve learned. Again, only over time. If you put your hand on her shoulder, and gently shove… Gently… You know what? Practice on the dog. Listen to me.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'The dog is sleeping on the bed, and starts snoring. Just go…”Ay!” If you hear, [IMITATES YELPING] That’s too hard. So, that’s how you know. Just… You want to dial that down. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But not too soft because then you’ve accomplished nothing. So you want… what you’re aiming for… You want to break their breathing cycle. That’s what you’re going for. And you’ll know you do it right when you hear this sound. [makes sucking sound] That’s it. It’s not pretty.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]', 'It’s not a pretty sound. But that’s what’s… [makes sucking sound] It’s like throwing a wrench under a tractor. It’s not nice, but…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'That’s your cue to turn over and go the hell to sleep. Because if you linger, her eyes will open, and she’ll just go, “Did you just shove me?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And you have to go, “I don’t think so.” [SCOFFS] “In fact, I’m sleeping. “So I don’t even know why you’re talking to me.” See, I… I try to live by the golden rule. And we all know the golden rule. Do unto others as you would have done unto you. It’s a great idea in life. It’s great in life. In marriage, [CLICKS TONGUE] not so much. Uh…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'It doesn’t always work in marriage, because I’ll be honest, there are many things I would happily have done unto me, that she don’t like done unto her.', 'And, and…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'She’s very vocal about it. She goes, “I don’t like when you do that.” And it sounds like I’m talking about something dirty. No. No, I mean simple things. Simple… If she’s driving, and I’m in the passenger seat, and I politely point out that our exit is coming up, oh, she gets so insulted. “You don’t have to tell me. I know.” I said, “Well, all right. I… “You know, hey, sometimes, you point it out to me. “And I don’t get offended.” She goes, “Right, because you don’t mind.” I said, “Right! What?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, I’m saying I don’t mind. She goes, “Right. But I do, “because I’m not you.” And that’s when I go, “Well, then, “the golden rule is not fucking working here, is it?” Because I only know me. I don’t know who else to draw from. If the golden rule is not working, let’s try the silver or the bronze, because…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '…the silver rule, I think, “Do unto others’ best guesses of what you think they might like done unto them.” And the bronze rule is, “You know what? “Don’t do unto anybody, anything. “Just sit there, eat your chicken, “wait till the show’s over. Just don’t get involved.” And I don’t wanna give you the impression… You know, I’m talking a lot about my marriage and… It’s all good. You know, I don’t want to… It’s all good. [SOFTLY] Know what I’m saying, it’s not all good. But you know what I’m saying, it’s all good. In general, it’s all good. It’s like the world. From space, looking down, it’s all good. You zoom in close, it’s not all good. You know what I’m saying? But you have to scale back, and it’s all good. When my friend asked me, you know, what’s the secret? I said, I must have learned something. And I said “Actually, I do have something. “I have something for you.” And this, I do believe to be true. For any long-term relationship, to keep it growing and keep it moving, you have to constantly find something new to fight about. That is so important. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I cannot stress that enough. So like in my house, the current friction du jour that I’m enjoying immensely, uh, my wife who I adore, we understand… …she has come to view with displeasure, my response time. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Do you know what I mean by response time? The gap in the time continuum from when she asks me something to the microsecond that I answer, that gap is not to her liking. She…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'She would prefer a snappy or brisker retort than the one I am affording. And in fairness to her, I got to be honest. A lot of times I do respond, but in my head. I just forget to talk. I… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That’s not her fault. That’s on me. I… “Did I not speak? I thought I spoke. I…” “You know, I just ran out of steam. “At 4:30, I just ran…” So, sometimes I don’t answer because of whatever that phenomenon is. Sometimes, though, I don’t answer [CLICKS TONGUE] because, to be honest, I didn’t hear the question. I didn’t hear it. The hearing is not as crisp as it used to be. But that’s not all the time. Sometimes I don’t answer right away because I’m thinking. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She asked me a question, I’d like to give an intelligent, thoughtful response. She doesn’t buy it. She… If I don’t answer it right away, she presumes it’s just because I’m old and deaf. So what she’ll do, is she’ll repeat what she just said, louder, and with ten times the hostility.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]', 'It jumps. It goes from, [SOFTLY] “What do you want for supper,” Straight to, [LOUDLY] “what do you want for…” “I know, I heard you, sweetheart. I heard it. “I was thinking. Maybe I should’ve have gone, ah, do do do do do… “Would that help you? “Do-do-do-do… chicken.” And by the way, her hearing is going too. However, it’s not her fault. It’s not her fault. The way I understand it… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] If I don’t hear her, that’s because my ears are going bad. If she doesn’t hear me, that’s because I don’t speak clearly.', 'So…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING]', 'You see the problem. Yes. This is the problem area. Either way you come at it, here seems to be the problem. And I called her on it one day. I said, “Sweetie, it’s always me, really? “It’s always me. It’s never you?” She said, “Yeah, Now, get the car. We’re late.” I said, “What, where are we going?” She said we’re not going anywhere. I said, “Why did you say get the car, we’re late?” She said, “I said, you need to articulate.”', 'I said, “Okay.”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It’s not how I heard. I said, “Well, maybe you need to articulate!” And then she mumbled something about going to truck yourself. We don’t have a truck. So… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] You know, it doesn’t even make sense. You see what I’m saying. Yeah. She’s starting to lose it. This is my concern. Yeah. And all married couples go through it. My parents went through this. I remember, in their golden years, my mother called me one night. She said, “I’m worried about your father. “It’s like he doesn’t hear me. “It’s like he doesn’t hear me.” So, she got him to go to an audiologist. The guy was like the 12th best in town. He was fine. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But this guy was smart. First question he said to my father, “Mr. Reiser, let me ask you, “how long are you married?” My father said, “46 years. Why?” The doctor said, “There’s the problem.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, apparen… There’s a medical thing. Apparently, if you hear the same voice for that duration of time, it wears down that particular frequency… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …in the ear canal.', 'That’s what’s happening.', '[AUDIENCE CHEERING]', 'That’s a scientific thing. Both ways. Him to her, her to him, him to him, them to them… Pronouns are not an issue. Any two people, over time, will over-tax that pathway. You can hear above, you can hear below. But that pathway, dead. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] My problem is a little more subtle. Like I said, I hear everything my wife says, but apparently, [CLICKS TONGUE] I hear it wrong. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I hear, “Well, if she said what I heard, we’re doing fine.” But often, it’s not what she said. We were in the kitchen the other day. She’s standing in front of the cabinet where we keep the candy, and she’s squinting. She’s looking into the candy cabinet, And she asked me… I thought… …for the name of our ophthalmologist. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Well, I saw her squinting. It didn’t seem unreasonable. So I said… “Schneiderman.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING LOUDLY, CLAPPING] “What?” Our ophthalmologist is Dr. Schneiderman. “Okay.”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“Why are you telling me that?” I said, “Did you not just ask me the name of our ophthalmologist?” She said, “No, I said what happened to all the HOT TAMALES?” I said, “All right, well… “that’s not how I heard it.” But I can see why saying “Schneiderman” wasn’t helpful there. Unless Schneiderman ate the HOT TAMALES. but how could that… No, it couldn’t be. It’s… And what makes it extra tricky? Sometimes, you’re not supposed to respond. Sometimes you’re not even supposed to be listening. Sometimes yes, sometimes no, but it’s not always clear what rules are in effect at any given moment. So my lovely wife, who… I adore… We’ve established, right? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She will walk into the room, and she’ll very quietly go, “Meh, I can’t believe it.” I go, “What’s the matter?” She’ll go, “I was talking to myself.” I said, “Okay, sorry.” And then, at the exact same volume, she’ll go, “Where did I put my phone?” “Hello?” That was to me then? The second part? So the second part was to me. Okay, so the first one, no, but the second one was to me. You were talking to me? She said, “Do you see anybody else here?” I’m like… “Mmm, mmm.” I thought you were talking to yourself. She said, well, evidently I was. Okay.', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]', 'I said, “My beloved… “We need a system.

It’s only the little things that will come up and sort of jeopardize a perfectly good union. And I was… This was… Again, I don’t know what things… We’re sitting around, I had my phone out, and I was trying to plan my week, yeah? And I said to my wife, casually, very casually, I said, “Sweetie, are we doing anything Saturday night?” [CLICKS TONGUE] She said… “Are you kidding me?”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'I’m like… Whoa!

She went beyond anger, to a state I had never seen.', 'Uh…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'She just looked at me differently. She looked at me with such a look of compassion and affection and just… genuine… just… it was just so angelic. She looked at me, and she said, I’m worried about you.

I’m gonna say something very important, and I’m gonna… Hear this… I’m gonna share with you the secret of life. I’m going to tell you the secret of life. But it came to me in a very odd way. Years ago, I got to make a movie, and I worked with… my idol, Peter Falk. Do you remember Peter Falk, Colombo? When I was a kid, I didn’t care about acting. Comedians… my idols were all comedians. I never cared about acting. But when I was like eight years old, I saw Peter Falk in a movie. I said, “What’s this guy doing? I love this guy!” So, years went by and I said, I want to… work with him. I wrote a movie where he played my father, and we got to be friends. And so one day, we’re talking about comedy. And I said, “Well, so what do you like? “What kind of comedies do you like?” So Peter Falk says, [IN RASPY VOICE] “Well, you know, uh…”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', '“…to be honest, “a lot of the things that make me laugh. “They don’t make other people laugh.” I said, “Well, try me. I’d be curious.” So he tells me this story which I’m gonna share with you. And I thought it was funny. I thought it was a very funny story. But over the years, I thought about it. I said, it’s more than funny. This story has hidden inside it, the secret of life. Here’s the story. So, Peter goes to lunch at a deli, a New York-style deli, all right? Waiter, old school waiter, but waiting tables 100 years, seen it all, nothing fazes him. He comes to the table, and he says, “Would anybody like dessert?” Peter Falk says, “Do you have rice pudding?” The guy says yes. Peter goes, “Hang on. “Before you bring it, “Does it have raisins?” The guy says no. He says, “Are you sure?” He says yeah. He says, “You’re positive? Because, a lot of places, “they put raisins in their rice puddings. “And I can’t eat raisins. “If it has a raisin, I don’t want it. I’ll tell you right now, “if it has raisins, I don’t want it.” The waiter says, “Mr. Falk, “I don’t know how else to tell you no. “There’s no raisins in the rice pudding. Peter Falk says, “All right, I’ll have it.” Waiter goes to the kitchen, brings out the rice pudding. It’s a chockful of raisins. Just…', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'Just covered. Top to bottom. [STUTTERS] Through the glass, dark with raisins. Peter Falk says, “Hey, I thought you said there’s no raisins!” The waiter just shrugged and said, “Here and there you’ll find a raisin.”', '[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]', 'And I said, well, that’s what life is, isn’t it? Nothing is all good. Even the things you love have things in it you don’t love! But that’s just the cost of doing business. So that’s what I wish for you nice people. In the rice pudding of life, deal with the raisins, but don’t forget to enjoy the pudding.', 'Thank you so much.

Sharing tales of his kids’ chaotic antics, from “a secret that’s brown” to surreal bedtime negotiations, Meyers hilariously captures the exhausting yet rewarding reality of fatherhood. He also riffs on marriage dynamics, his ineptitude with strollers, and the absurdity of TSA rules about hummus.

And they’re like, if you touch lava, do you die? I could never hate my kids. I could never hurt my kids. I could never hurt my kids. You guys, I could never hurt my kids.', 'I will admit, every now and then, I do pull off one of their sweaters as fast as I can. If it’s the end of a long day and they won’t even do me the courtesy of helping me get them undressed, I will take every top layer they’re wearing and yank it upwards because– and it brings me great shame to say it– this moment gives me joy.', 'When it catches. When it catches like this. When I “Clockwork Orange” my children into seeing what they’ve done to me. It’s not permanent. It always goes right back down, you know? I will say, your perspective on almost everything changes once you have kids. And again, mine are eight, six, and two.', 'And I will say, something that has become very haunting to receive in the mail for us is a wedding invitation because one of two things can happen when we receive a wedding invitation. The first thing is that the wedding invitation says, “We’re encouraging people not to bring their children,” and that means we have to find child care for an evening or sometimes a whole weekend. And that’s bad.', 'But what is worse is when they say, “We’re inviting your whole family to witness our special day.” And that is only something that a dumb, unmarried couple would think is a good idea. A dumb, unmarried, childless couple would think it’s a good idea to have kids witness your special day ’cause they don’t know yet that kids will ruin any day, special or otherwise.', 'And when I have three young kids at a wedding, I’m just dreading the moment that I’m gonna have to go out on the dance floor, interrupt the father-daughter dance, and be like, hi, I’m so sorry to interrupt. Congratulations, sir. She makes a beautiful bride. Hey, our kids ate your cake. They ate the whole cake. I don’t know what to say. The cake is gone, and I can tell it’s a really expensive cake.', 'But it’s kind of your fault because we never should have been here. And anyway, if you’re thinking I’m not gonna be punished, I’m gonna be punished ’cause my kids ate a whole giant cake. So that means they’re gonna be up all night, and they’re gonna be shitting all morning. The kids ate the cake.', 'Thank you, by the way, for making them wear tiny tuxedos. You don’t know this yet about kids, but their favorite thing in the world to do is go to a formal wear place while a guy tells them to stand still with pins in his mouth. Thank you for that. Thank you for the tiny tuxedos.', 'We should have bought one ’cause I can’t imagine it would have been less expensive than how fucking expensive it was to rent. Anyways, my wife’s in the car. She wanted me to say goodbye. She’s passive aggressively looking at her phone, ’cause I guess right before she went to the bathroom, she said, don’t let the kids eat the cake. And that’s exactly what had happened.', 'So now she might never talk to me again. But I want you to know I hope you stay married forever. And if you don’t stay married forever and get divorced, I’m gonna come and take a dump on your lawn. Thank you. Good night.', 'Beautiful bride. Can we admit now that having to show a vaccine card to get into a restaurant during COVID was not, in fact, like living in Germany during World War II? Can we admit that now? Because, you guys, every single time I had to show my vaccine card to get into a restaurant, the host or the hostess was so apologetic.', 'They’re like, we’re so sorry. Can we just take a quick look at your vaccine card? Or if you have a picture of your vaccine card on your phone, or if you want to take a picture of my vaccine card and just show it back to me. Or if you can just prove to me that your phone can take pictures, that’s more than enough for us to get you to your table.', 'And I’ve seen a lot of movies about Germany during World War II, and I don’t remember a single scene where the Gestapo behaved that way. I don’t remember a single scene where the Gestapo kicked in the door and was like…', '[German accent] We demand to see your papers. And we are so sorry. That we are still doing this whole “see your papers” things. This is so irritating to us, too. This is, like, for real, our least favorite part… About being in ze Gestapo. It’s just our boss is such… a Nazi.', '[normal voice] That is a very offensive German accent. That is a cartoonishly bad German accent. And recently, I did a show, and there was a German audience member. And afterwards, they came up to me, and they said, do you often do a German accent on stage? And I said, yes, I enjoy doing a German accent on stage. And they said, how would you feel if you saw a German comedian doing an American accent on stage? And I said, I’m never gonna see a German comedian.', 'Like, what is the series of events that would have to go wrong in my life for me to, like, walk into a club as someone on stage is like, make some noise for Klaus? And then I’m like, I’ll stick around for this. And then I’m sitting in my seat, and all of a sudden, he’s like, and then Americans are like, I would like 20 Chicken McNuggets. And I’m like, we don’t sound like that.', 'Anyway, after that very rude answer, he regrouped, and he said, well, how about this? Would you do an African accent on stage? And I said, dear God, no. I would never do an African accent on stage. And he said, where is the line? And I said, where is the line for what accents a white comedian can do in 2024? The borders of Europe. That’s the line, from Finland to Italy, from Portugal to Ukraine.', 'I wouldn’t fuck with Turkey. That’s the line. And you can have a healthy comedy career. Here, I’ll show you how it works. Here’s my impression of a Swedish person ordering from a Chinese waiter.', '[Swedish accent] Yes, hello. Do you have the chicken chow mein tonight?', '[normal voice] No, we’re out of that. I chose Swedish on purpose because I’m almost certain it’s impossible to do an offensive Swedish accent. And I’m basing that entirely on the fact that “The Muppet Show” never got canceled. How was that OK? How was the Swedish Chef OK? Schmorgedy, borgedy, borgedy.', 'That was– that was–as a child, that was my introduction to Swedish people. That’s how I thought they all behaved. I thought they were imbeciles who were bad with cutlery. Schmorgedy, borgedy, borgedy. Can you imagine– what would it have sounded like if they’d taken the same approach with the Pakistani Chef?', 'I’m not gonna do it. But at least now I know what the sound of 1,500 buttholes closing at the same time is. Fwup. My kids are really lucky. They have all four grandparents in their lives, and they see them all the time in person. But they also see them all the time on FaceTime. They’re interacting with them every day.', 'It’s so unlike how I talk to my grandparents. My dad put me on the phone with my grandmother once a year the way a kidnapper would put a hostage on the phone with the police. He would say, say hello to your grandmother. I’d like, hello. And then he’d grab the phone back. He’s like, now you know the boy’s alive! Put $5 in a birthday card and leave it under the highway overpass.', 'I love having my parents around my kids. It’s one of the most special things you can experience in life. I love it so much. The only thing that’s hard is that your parents are always gonna have a different parenting style from when they did it to the parenting style that you’re currently using now.', 'Again, my dad was a dad of young kids a long time ago, but he was an old-school screamer. My dad would yell at me and my brother, and we were not a three-strike family. We were a one-strike family. If you disobeyed, he would just start laying into you.', 'And we have a much more modern, non-confrontational parenting style. We never yell. We use language like– when they’re misbehaving, we say, I can see you’re upset right now. And while I don’t want to invalidate the very real feelings you’re having, I do encourage you to work through it on a timeline that’s conducive to your schedule while remembering the most important thing, this is just as much your house as it is ours.', 'And sometimes my dad comes over, and he reverts to his old ways. And he tells the kids to stop doing something, and they don’t. And then he just starts screaming at them. And when my dad yells at my kids, I immediately intervene. I always run over. I’m like, Dad, that is not our way. That is your way. And while I would never want to invalidate your way or make you feel less than–', 'But I have to admit something to you guys. When my dad yells at my kids, I always tell him to stop. But also, there is a tiny voice in the back of my head that always wants to scream, give ’em hell, old man! Let ’em know how good they have it!', '‘Cause, guys, I got to admit something. I’m not sure our modern parenting style is working. I’m not seeing the day-to-day results. Like, the other day, my eight-year-old just bit my six-year-old, just fully bit him. They weren’t even wrestling. He just saw him across the room.', 'And I just watched him, like, think, like, I’m gonna go bite him right now. He was like a robot that was like, initiate biting protocol. And he went over, and he bit him so hard. And then he said, I didn’t bite him. And I was like, look at the teeth marks. I could take your brother’s arm to an orthodontist right now, and they could fit you for Invisalign.', 'And I was so mad. I never do this. I grabbed my son, and I said, you’re gonna have a timeout in the other room. And I put him in a room, and I slammed the door. And my plan was just to make him spend five minutes thinking about how badly he behaved, just five minutes reflecting on the consequences of his actions.', 'But I’m such a modern wuss, I could only make it, like, two and a half minutes before I started thinking, oh, my God, he’s gonna be in therapy the rest of his life. This is a trauma he’ll never recover from. I have to go in and let him know he’s my little slugger and I’m always gonna love him no matter what.', 'And I opened the door, expecting to see him in a puddle in the middle of the room on the floor. And not only was he not there, he was leaning against the window, looking out across the city, not a care in the world. He looked like he was in a French new wave film. All that was missing was a beret and a cigarette.', '[French accent] Did I bite him? Perhaps. But in life, you’re either the biter or ze bitter.', '[normal voice] I’ll tell you this. I have a theory, guys. My theory is this. I think my kids are gonna yell at their kids. I think it skips a generation. And I think at night, my boys are in their bunk bed talking about it and saying, when I grow up, I’m not gonna do that ineffective bullshit Dad does. I’m gonna get loud like Grandpa. And the other was one’s like, oh, totally. I’m not gonna be a beta cuck like Dad. Invalidate your feelings? Bitch, grow up.', 'My wife thinks the world can help us be better parents, and she’s always sending me Instagram videos of Instagram moms who are trying to share their wisdom. My take is if they look too well put together, I just think they have different kinds of kids than ours.', 'Like, if they have a blowout and a Ring light, I’m just like, I don’t think this is meant for us. And they often have very cryptic advice. My wife sent me one where it was a woman just very calmly saying, positive feedback is really important for a child. If you tell your child in the morning that you like their handwriting, they’re less likely to punch a sibling at night.', 'Now, I don’t know if that’s true or not, because I never remember it until it’s too late. Like, they’ll just be wailing on each other in the corner. And I run over, and I’m like, I like your handwriting!', 'There is–there is an Instagram mom I really like, a style of Instagram mom. It’s the one who’s, like, barely keeping it together. And they’re shooting their video like Blair Witch Project style on their phone. And they’re, like, hiding in the closet before their kids can find them.', 'They’re like, hi, I don’t have a lot of time. We figured out a way to get Sharpie off wallpaper. What you have to do is– oh, no, they found me!', 'My wife and I are both incredibly close with our parents, and I think it’s one of the first things we connected on. We thought if we started our own family, maybe we would have kids that wanted to hang out as much with us as we want to hang out with our parents.', 'With that said, our families also have some differences. For example, when I was growing up, the rule at the dinner table was never speak unless spoken to. If you do speak, have it be relevant to the conversation at hand, and certainly never talk until the person who is currently talking has finished, whereas I feel like in my wife’s family, the rule was as soon as you think something, say it out loud.', 'Ideally, try to start saying it before you finish thinking it. Try to hear the completed thought outside your head with your ears for the very first time.', 'Another cool thing my wife’s family does is they will call a restaurant to order delivery, and it’s only when they’re on the phone with the restaurant that they ask everybody else what they want. They will low-key criticize the restaurant on the phone with the restaurant. They’ll be like, should we get the dumplings? And from across the room, someone will be like, no, their dumplings are soggy. We’re not gonna get the dumplings.', 'My wife’s family is Jewish, which I haven’t said yet, but I have told you. If there’s one thing Jewish people agree on, I would love to know what that is. I really want to stress, these jokes are all pro-Semitic.', 'I love my Jewish wife. I love my Jewish children. I have incredible in-laws. The best thing about my in-laws is they’re very easy to find. If you’re ever looking for them, they’re in the middle of my fucking business. Knock.', 'We have a tricky conversation coming up with our children because my wife’s grandparents were Holocaust survivors. And obviously, that’s something we’re going to have to explain to them one day.', 'The problem with kids is sometimes they will ask you a question before you’re prepared on how to answer it, and they sort of force your hand. And the other day, my wife said to one of our sons, you’re so lucky you know all four of your grandparents. Your grandmother didn’t know any of her grandparents.', 'And he said, what happened to them? And she said, they all died in a war. And he said, were they soldiers? And she said, not everyone who dies in a war is a soldier. And then he paused for a second and said, oh. Were they drummers?', 'Because he’d seen a Revolutionary War picture book, and quite smartly, may I say, deduced that while the soldiers are obviously in grave danger, these drummers up front are dead men.', 'What a bad time to be good at drumming, the Revolutionary War. Maybe the worst time ever to be good at drumming. And I bet when you heard word that they were looking for drummers, you got so excited. You’re like, oh, my God, that’s great. We don’t have to fight. We’ll stay back and rehearse for a concert.', 'And then whenever the survivors get here, we’ll do a gig for them. And so they raise their hand. They were like, I know how to drum. And they’re like, great, go strap it on and stand up front. And they were like, up front? And they’re like yeah, it’s gonna be you, another drummer, and a flute guy.', 'And the flute guy was like, actually, it’s a fife. And they’re like, not now, flute guy.', 'My wife argues that I should convert to Judaism. Her argument is everybody already assumes that I’m Jewish– not a bad argument. I’m a quarter Jewish. Every Jewish person I’ve ever met has said, you’re Jewish, right?', 'I’m also a quarter Swedish. Not one Swedish person has ever said, schmorgedy, borgedy, borgedy, borg?', 'That’s how they talk, guys. I’m not gonna apologize for how they talk. Why would “The Muppet Show” lie to me? That’s how Swedish people talk.', 'And this is how lab assistants talk– me, me, me, me, me, me, me.', 'I recently found out some things about my lineage because I did this incredible show on PBS called Finding Your Roots with Professor Henry Louis Gates. It’s a wonderful show, great show. He’s a brilliant man. And I found out some things about my family that I hadn’t known before.', 'I found out I had descended from Lithuanian Jews, Lithuanian Jews, famous for coining the expression, we got to get the fuck out of Lithuania.', 'But I was a bad subject for the show Finding your Roots because I am not easily shocked or amazed. And the best thing about that show is when they reveal information to you about your lineage, and you are shocked and amazed.', 'And because I’m not easily shocked and amazed, it was just a bad episode. Like, for example, at one point, Henry Louis Gates looked at me and said, we tracked down one of your ancestors to the year 1650. We found their name written in a town ledger from the year 1650. How does that make you feel, knowing we tracked back a relative of yours to the year 1650?', 'And all I could manage was, well, I mean, I knew I came from people. It’s not like he was like, your great-great-grandmother was a mermaid.', 'He did shock me once, but it was by accident. You sit across from him, and there’s a table between you, and on the table is a big book full of information, and he tees up the story. And when he tees up the story, he asks you to turn the page to reveal the information.', 'And at one point, he said to me, you’re a performer. And I said, I’m a performer. He said, do you anyone else in your family tree who’s a performer?', 'And I go, I don’t know a single other person in my family tree who is a performer. And he said, why don’t you turn the page? Because I think the next thing you’re gonna see is pretty cool.', 'So I turn the page, and it was a newspaper obituary about my great-grandfather who had died from suicide. And Henry Louis Gates goes, what does it say?', 'And I said, oh, exactly that. I go, my great-grandfather, it seems he died by suicide. And Henry Louis Gates, to his credit, just looked at me and said, that’s a mistake. I apologize. We’re gonna edit this out.', 'And then he said, why don’t you turn another page? So I turned another page, and I’m like, oh, my grandfather was in a school play.', 'And he said, pretty cool, right? And I was like, Henry! You can’t bounce back from accidentally showing someone a suicide obituary.', 'That would be like if a magician was like, is this your card? And you’re like, no, I think that’s a picture of your dick. Oh, fuck. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.', 'Is this your card? Nine of spades. Is this your card? You’re still thinking about the dick pic? Yeah! Yeah, dude.', 'This is the time of the night where a lot of comedians will start doing their anti-trans material. I’m happy to inform you I have no anti-trans material. I have nothing but love and respect for the trans community.', 'And also, I’m always so frustrated when people frame it as how it’s inconvenient to them when someone transitions, when they talk about how they have to learn a new name or a new pronoun, or they have to change a contact in their email address folder.', 'And really, if we’re being honest– let’s be honest for a second. What would actually be harder for you, if someone in your life decided they were transitioning to a new gender, or if someone in your life decided that as of tomorrow, they were going to be a vegan?', 'Like, what makes your life harder tomorrow?', 'Because, you guys, five years ago, my brother decided to be a vegan, and I’ve spent multiple Thanksgivings with him, and I 100% would prefer my next Thanksgiving start with my dad walking in and saying, I’m a lady now– Than I would spending another Thanksgiving where my brother keeps asking me, is there butter in this?', 'I’m like, there’s fucking butter in everything. That is the true meaning of Thanksgiving is butter in everything. That’s how the first Thanksgiving started.', 'The Indigenous people came over. They were like, this is maize. And the pilgrims said, what if we put butter on it and call it corn?', 'And the Indigenous people were like, oh, my God, this is so much better. How can we ever repay you? And the pilgrims were like, we have an idea, but we’re not gonna tell you yet. White man.', 'My brother, who’s hardcore– my brother will not eat honey. My brother said that vegans who eat honey are called beegans.', 'I found out he didn’t eat honey because one day, he was over at my apartment, and I just sort of threw a granola bar at him because he looked like he was starving. And… he picked it up, and he just started reading the label.', 'If there was a logo for veganism, it should be someone at your home reading a label. Found a problem!', 'By the way, I wish I could be a vegan. Every argument for being a vegan is a good one. It’s better for the environment. It’s more humane.', 'The best argument, though, is this, you guys. My brother looks so much healthier than I do. Like, if you saw a picture of my brother and I next to each other, you would stop eating meat yesterday.', 'Like, he glows like the sun. And next to him, I look like a guy holding a lantern at the bow of a ferry. I’m like– The fog is thick, but we’ll make it through.', 'I mentioned my in-laws earlier, and I want to give a special– pay a little special attention to my wonderful mother-in-law. I really do have the greatest mother-in-law in the world.', 'And my favorite thing about her is there are also times that she agrees with me that my wife is being a lot. Sometimes my wife and I will be fighting in front of my mother-in-law, and she will just make eye contact with me from across the room as if to say, sorry.', 'But it has to be non-verbal. It is only of value to me if it is a non-verbal acknowledgment of my wife’s behavior.', 'If she actually speaks up in my defense, that’s a disaster for me. Because every married person here knows that it’s always just easiest to agree with your spouse when they’re complaining about something.', 'And I cannot tell you how many times it’s been the end of the night, and we’re getting ready for bed. And my wife will say, can you believe my mom says I have to be nicer to you?', 'And my only response is yeah, what a bitch. Mind your own business, lady.', 'I do have a mean wife. You guys– But only to me. My wife is mean to me, and she is so nice to the kids, and that is so much better than the other way around.', 'If my wife was nice to me but mean to the kids, my life would be a nightmare. I would come home, and they’d always run over and be like, hey man, you got to step in and do something. We’re your kids, too.', 'And I’d be like, shh, don’t talk to me. I don’t want her to know we’re friends.', 'I–by the way, this is not an attack on my wife. This is a defense of her meanness. My wife works so hard. She has three children. She is so depleted.', 'She has a full-time job. My wife is a lawyer. My wife passed the New York Bar. She is a brilliant woman. The New York Bar, that’s the hardest one. That’s the one Giuliani passed.', 'So I get it. She is tired all the time, and she’s so patient with her children. And sometimes she has to take it out on me.', 'And also, I deserve it, you guys. I am so irritating. Here are some of the things I do. Here are some of the things I do that earn her meanness.', 'We’re on our third kid. I still don’t know how to collapse the stroller. No idea. I look at a stroller the way a dog would if you told him to do origami.', 'I have no idea how to fold up the stroller. I’ll just, like, wiggle it. I’ll shake it a little bit.', 'Hey, quick question for the women here. Have you ever, while watching your husband try to collapse the stroller, thought to yourself, I can’t believe I ever thought this man could satisfy me sexually?', 'Like, while he’s like, I think I got it. I almost got it. Are you like, there’s a button?', 'It’s like, no, I think it’s almost there. Just a few more pumps.', 'You want to hear something heartbreaking? The first time my wife heard me tell that joke, hardest she’s ever laughed.', 'She laughed a hurtful amount. She screamed from the audience, amen, brother! Preach!', 'That’s not to say my wife is perfect. There are a few things I would change about her as well.', 'If I could change something about my wife, I would try to improve her skills as a directional speaker.', 'My wife says important things to me all the time with her back to me while she’s walking out of the room without raising her voice at all. She’ll say things like, the gas company was here today. They say there’s a toxic–', 'So we have this fight all the time where she’ll be like, remember, we’re having dinner with the Harrises in an hour. And I’m like, when did you tell me that?', 'And she’s like, Monday, when I whispered it into the mailbox.', 'Another thing I would change about my wife is her caffeinated beverage of choice.', 'My wife’s caffeinated beverage of choice is a matcha latte. If you don’t know what that is, I’ll tell you what it’s not– available at the coffee place you are going to.', 'It’s such a rude thing to ask for when someone’s like, we’re getting coffee, what do you want? It would be like if you’re like, hey, we’re ordering pizza. Can we get you anything? A quiche Lorraine.', 'They’re not gonna have that. It doesn’t hurt to ask. It does hurt to ask. I don’t want to look like a lunatic.', 'I think my wife likes matcha lattes because they are hard to get. And the reason I say that is my wife’s love language is acts of service.', 'Do you guys know the concept of love languages? Here’s the concept of love languages for those of you who don’t know.', 'There are five love languages. This is how people receive love. There’s acts of service, touch, quality time, gifts, and words of encouragement.', 'And, guys, I don’t know who came up with this list. All I know is that their love language is definitely acts of service, because this is the biggest scam ever that acts of service is lumped on this list with the other four reasonable things.', 'Here’s life if your love language is touch and your wife is acts of service.', 'When I get home, I would like a hug. I need you to fix the boiler.', 'Quality time. Want to go for a walk? Yeah, after you clean out the gutters.', 'It’s like if an airline’s loyalty program was like, we have gold, platinum, silver. And when we land, you clean the plane.', 'This is all– what I’ve been doing is all a very good example of how it is hard to be married to a comedian.', 'I just get to come up here and tell you guys what I’m thinking about my marriage. And so, yes, it is hard to be married to a comedian.', 'But, guys, it’s also very hard to be a comedian who is married.', 'And what I mean by that is when you’re married, the right thing to do when you’re having an argument is always say the thing that will most quickly deescalate the situation.', 'But when you’re a comedian, those aren’t the things that pop into your head.', 'When you’re a comedian in the middle of an argument, all you ever think is this is a funny thing I could say that will make it worse.', 'Here’s an example, a recent example.', 'My boys love superheroes, and they’re always asking me questions about superheroes.', 'They’ll say, who would win a fight between Batman and Spider-Man? Who’s stronger, the Hulk or Thor?', 'And the other day, they said, who’s faster, Superman or the Flash?', 'And that’s an age-old comic book question. I was so proud of them for even coming up with it.', 'And I said, you know what, let me check on YouTube.', 'And sure enough, there was a three-minute clip from a “Justice League” cartoon of Superman racing the Flash.', 'And I said, you know what, let’s watch it.', 'Now, the important part of this story is our kids do not have a lot of screen time. I don’t say that to be like, we’re better parents than anyone here. I just mean that our kids will turn out better than yours.', 'So– I got one boy on each knee. And I got my phone out, and we’re watching Superman race the Flash.', 'And my wife walks in, and she says, what are you doing?', 'And I say, we’re watching Superman race the Flash.', 'And she says, a cartoon?', 'And I couldn’t help myself.', 'And I said, no, the real guys.', 'Isn’t that crazy?

I’d been honest without being truthful.', 'And that would be the end of that story, but we had to fly back to New York.', 'And on the way back, my wife stopped on the way to the airport at a Whole Foods and bought a tub of hummus, same size, if not even a little bit bigger.', 'And they found it again.', 'This time, they found it in the Whole Foods bag, which is what you call asking for it.', 'And they pulled it out, and they said to my wife, you can’t bring hummus on the plane.', 'And she said, I’ve brought hummus on the plane before, conveniently leaving out what had happened the most recent before.', 'And still, they took her hummus.', 'And then we walked through.', 'And we were walking, and I could tell she was upset.', 'And I knew I shouldn’t say anything.', 'I knew the right path forward was just to keep my mouth shut, but I couldn’t help myself.', 'And I turned to her with a big smile and said, well, you’ll get them next time.', 'She is here tonight, by the way.', 'She’s not here. Are you crazy?', 'She’s here, and I’m gonna tell the hummus story we haven’t talked about since?', 'I’ll tell you this. I know my wife. She’s a substantial woman. She’s got grit. She’s got determination.', 'The next time we fly, she’s getting hummus on a plane. I believe in her. I believe she’s gonna get hummus on the plane. She’s gonna go to the airport. She’s gonna unzip her carry-on, and she’s gonna take out a bag of chickpeas and a muddler. And she’s gonna look that TSA agent in the eye and be like, officer, I think everything here is legal and above board. And they’re just gonna nod ’cause they know they’ve lost. And then in deference to her victory, all of the TSA in the airport is gonna stand to make a gate for her to walk through. They’re gonna hold up their magnetic wands like swords. And she’s gonna walk through the airport underneath the magnetic wands. And passengers are gonna scream her name and throw pita chips at her feet like rose petals. And then she’s gonna get on the plane, and we’re gonna sit down. And she’s gonna finish making her concoction, and she’s gonna say to the kids, who wants hummus? And they’re all gonna say, we hate hummus. And I’m gonna whisper, don’t care for.', 'So my kids have never watched my show, but I recently brought my kids to the show because we had our tenth anniversary show, and we had President Joe Biden on the show. Thank you. Very kind. We had President Biden on the show. And I thought, you know what? When’s the next time I’m gonna have my kids be in the position to meet the president? And, you know, I might not want them to meet the next one. So I said, you know what, let’s– let’s bring the kids in to meet the president. And the best thing about watching my kids meet the president is not how the president behaved, but rather how each of my children acted differently based on their personality. First up was my oldest, and my oldest is just– he’s the sweetest boy in the world, and he’s just trying so hard. Like a lot of oldest siblings, he just wants to be the best kid he can be. So anyway, he picked out his outfit, and he wore his nicest clothes from his picture day. And he just walked into the room, and he was like, hello, Mr. President, my name is Ashe. Nice to meet you. And I was just so proud of him. Like, my heart broke at how wonderfully he had performed. Next up was my middle son. He was born in the lobby of an apartment building and behaves like it every day of his life. I don’t–can’t quite explain what that is. I just know that even if you didn’t know who he was, if you saw him across the room, you’d be like, I think that one was born in a lobby. He picked out his outfit as well. He wore a train conductor’s jacket and a pair of Ray-Bans. And he literally danced into the room. And when he danced into the room, my oldest was so embarrassed. He, like, cocked his fist back. And then he remembered that earlier that morning, I told him he had good handwriting, and he was like– So my middle dances in the room and just starts singing. ♪ Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden ♪ And he gets right next to him, and he screams in the president’s face. You’re my “fave-whit” “pwesident!” And Joe Biden was so taken aback because I don’t even think Joe Biden is Joe Biden’s favorite president. He looked at me like, have you not told him about Obama? Because he would– if he likes me, he would love Obama.', 'And then the best, though, was my daughter, Addie, two and a half. And the president was incredible with her. It was really something to see, his sweetness. He sat on the couch so that he was at eye level with her. And she walked over, and he reached into a bag. And he pulled out a stuffed Commander, the White House dog. And he didn’t know this, but in January, I had gone to the White House, and I had left with three stuffed Commanders, and I had given them to my children. But he reached into the bag, and he held it out to Addie. And he went like, [mumbles]. He said, I got this for you. And she just looked at it, and then she looked at him and said, I got that. And he said, you have one of these? And she goes, yeah, I got that at home. And he’s just holding it. And he goes, you want another one? And she goes, no. And I’ve been so worried about that interaction all day because my daughter is a huge Trump supporter, and–and not on social issues. It’s all tax stuff with her. She’s NATO. She feels like the NATO countries don’t pay enough. Don’t get into it with her if you see her.', 'I have a weird thing happening, which is I grew up in the suburbs. All I ever wanted to do was live in New York City. My kids live in New York City. All they want to do is live in the suburbs. Like, we visit my parents. My parents live in the same house I grew up in in a nondescript New Hampshire suburb. And every time we leave, my kids are basically like, when are you gonna make enough money to buy a house like this? Because we live in New York, and nothing about New York makes sense to kids. There’s none of the appeal of New York appeals to them. They’re never like, well, sure, Grandma and Grandpa have a front and back yard, but we can walk to the theater!', 'I have one of those New York City apartments, if you ever lived in New York, you’d be like, this is a great apartment. If you lived anywhere else in the world, you’d be like, I guess so. Here are some of the features about my very expensive New York City apartment. It’s never fully dark. It’s never fully quiet. We live near a university, so every other night at 1:00 in the morning, you hear someone yell something like, Krista says she’ll meet us there! And whoever the Krista news is being yelled at does not hear it the first time. So they’re like, Krista’s not with us! And so then the first person has to be like, no, Krista says she’ll meet us there! And it takes everything in my power not to open up the window and be like, you guys, Krista’s dead! Krista died. It’s, like, so sad, you guys, but she’s dead.', 'Do we have heat in our apartment? Yeah, we have exposed radiators. And the best thing about them is they’re so hot that when you touch it, you don’t burn yourself. You just die. They’re like lava that way, I think. I’ve been told our radiators are the feature of a prewar building. I’m not sure which war they were talking about. They’re not the only prewar feature in our apartment building. We also have a neighbor across the hall who could definitely find Prussia on a map. And much like Prussia after World War II, she also doesn’t have boundaries.', 'The other day, I was trying to get my son out the door to school. And I got him into the hallway, and he was just having one of those rough mornings that kids have. And I got him in the hallway, and then he sort of wrestled his way free of me, and he ran into the apartment. And then I chased him in with his shoes in my hand, and I left the door open. And I finally managed to get him in a chair. And I’m trying to get his shoes on. And I’m upset, and he’s crying. And we’re just having a really bad morning. And then, all of a sudden, we hear–', '♪ Hush, little baby ♪\\n♪ Don’t say a word ♪', 'And we turn around, and our neighbor has just wandered through the open door into our apartment, wearing a nightgown the color of which I would describe as Victorian apparition. Ghost of girl who drowned in town well. And I love that she was in her apartment, and she heard a kid crying, and she goes, I know what calms kids down, the haunted nursery rhymes they sing in horror movie trailers. But there is a very happy ending to that story, and it’s what I’m gonna leave you with, because in that moment when our neighbor walked in, my son and I locked eyes. And I realized he was thinking the exact same thing that I was thinking. Because he looked at her, and then he looked at me, and he said, fuck this.

[audience laughing] [Tom laughs] Keeps getting funnier every year. [Tom and audience laugh] I’m, uh, happy to be here. I’ve been going through some changes at my house. We, uh, dropped off my last daughter, my last child, my youngest, off at college. And they’re all gone now, and nobody tells you how hard it’s gonna be pretending to be sad. [audience laughing] [applause] [cheering and applause] Not one tear. Not one tear. [audience laughs] [laughs] I really thought I was gonna cry. I feel so bad. [audience laughs] But I think I might be happier than I’ve ever been. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] And it’s all right, you know. We did all the things. We did all the things. Look, I love her to death. I love both of them. I love ’em to death. But, you know, we had a good run. It’s over. [audience laughing] They want me to be happy. You don’t want to think your dad’s home, in your empty room, crying his eyes out. You want to think he’s all right, moving on with his life, microdosing, and watching Rick and Morty by himself. [audience laughing] That’s what I’m doing.', '[laughs] Yeah.', '[audience cheering] Yeah. Because I have freedom now. I never had freedom before. When I was little, I don’t know if you’re like me, but when I was a child, they made me live with my parents. [audience laughing] And I couldn’t drink stuff or smoke stuff ’cause they were always around. And then when I got away from them, I made my own family. Nobody tells you, when you have kids, your children become your new parents. [audience laughs] And you can’t drink stuff or smoke stuff because they’re always around. And they can’t keep a secret. [audience laughing] But now, for the first time, they’re all gone, and I’m doing all the stuff. [audience laughs] I can have martinis in the middle of the afternoon. [audience cheers] Yes. [cheering and applause] Because I know no one’s gonna call me out of the blue and ask for a ride home from karate. [audience laughs] [laughs] There were a lot of years I did very questionable driving at 4:00 in the afternoon. [deep breath] “I got her. I’ll get them.” [audience laughing] [sighs] I don’t even wear clothes there anymore. [audience laughs] What’s the point? My wife leaves for work in the morning, pants off. The dogs are so happy. They’re like, “You’re one of us now.”', '“Ah!”', '[audience laughing] [laughs] Rolling around in the backyard, my dog’s just looking at me. “Rub your ass on this tree. It’s amazing.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] And she’s right. It is. [audience laughing] It’s a special tree. [Tom and audience laugh] But I’ll be honest with you, folks. I’ll be honest. It almost killed us. It almost killed us. Raising kids is no joke. It’s no joke. If you don’t have children, people approach you all the time very flippantly. “When are you gonna do it? You should have kids.” “When are you gonna have kids?” No. You should think long and hard about whether you’re gonna have kids. You should have seen me before this experiment. [audience laughs] I was skinny. I had long curly hair. [audience laughing] And I could see. I could see.', '[audience laughing]', 'I used to have eyes like an eagle. Now I have eyes like a crab. [audience laughing] My wife and I are just husks. We’re just brittle husks of what we were. We’ll be in the kitchen some days. She’ll be like, “We could fool around right here. No one would ever know.” I’m like, “Yeah, we could.” [audience laughing] “Or we could just lie down on this cold floor for a while and shut our eyes.” “It’s really nice down here.” “We’re not dying. We’re just resting.” [audience laughing] I really can’t see anymore. Not all the time. Just when I’m driving at night with other cars around.', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] There’s a lot coming at me. It’s like a fireworks display out there. I’m like, “I guess I’ll just aim for the dark part in the middle.” [audience laughing] Mistaking a lot of garbage cans for people at night.', '“Oh!”', '[audience laughing] [laughs] “Why is everybody out tonight?” [audience laughing] “They’re not. It’s just recycle day. You’re all right.” You’ve just got to get smart with it. You have to adapt. I’m using the curbs now. [audience laughing] [laughs] That’s why they’re there. I just ricochet my way back to the house.', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom chuckles] But it is a real treat. It is. Like, I can go back to being who I was before all of this. You know? When you have kids, you have to pretend you’re Superman. You have children looking for protection. And you don’t have new skills. They just kicked you out of the hospital. “Good luck.” No instructions. You know? And… and I wasn’t Superman. And now that they’re older, I can admit, I’m just a guy. And they know now that they’re lucky to be alive. [audience laughing] A lot of times, when I was a young father, I wanted to cry. But you can’t, you know? I didn’t want my kids coming home from school, seeing me at the kitchen table, just sobbing. [sobs] “Dad, what’s wrong?” “Everything! Everything!” [audience laughing] “I can’t figure any of this out.” [audience laughing] “I don’t have any money. Do you have money?” [audience laughing] “I saw a birthday card on the counter. Don’t lie to me.” [audience laughing] [Tom chuckles] You can’t be honest with them when they’re little. “Dad, are there really monsters?” “I don’t know. Probably.”', '[audience laughing]', '“I feel it sometimes. Don’t you feel it?” [audience laughing] “Sometimes I think I hear it.” “Do you ever hear them in the attic? What is that?” [audience laughing] [laughing] You can’t say that. When they come to breakfast, “Thank God you’re alive! I didn’t think you were gonna make it.” [audience laughing] “I thought I heard chewing last night. I thought it was you.” [audience laughing] Now I can be honest. You know? I don’t like the dark. I tell them. No, I don’t like the dark. I don’t think anyone likes the dark. You don’t like the dark. No, it’s scary. In our utility room, we have this door that’s on a spring. As soon as you get in off the garage, where we store all the stuff. And the door closes automatically as soon as you get in there. But the switch is on the opposite wall in these shelves. And it’s too long. It’s too far. You can’t… I can’t keep it open with my foot, so you got to nail it. And you go for it. Sometimes there’s an Easter basket, or… ah!', '[audience laughing]', 'And it closes, and it’s dark. Oh! Whatever has been chasing me my whole life is like, “Gotcha!” [audience laughing] I couldn’t admit that when they were little. I’d tuck in these two little girls, these two beautiful angels. “Good night, girls. I’ll see you in the morning.” “Good night, Dad.” “Can you keep the light on? It’s scary in the dark.” “No, no, no.” [audience laughing] “Come on. There’s nothing to be afraid of.” “I’ll see you in the morning.” [audience laughing] Then I run to my room and turn everything on.', '[audience laughing]', '[breathing heavily] ‘Cause it’s scary in the dark, and I knew it was scary, because I could hear their whimpering down the hallway. [audience laughing] For hours. [cheering and applause] We did one of those DNA tests before they left.', '[audience laughing]', 'I highly recommend it. I really do. I really do. I know it’s a little sketchy, ’cause you gotta give your DNA away to a corporation. And they’re not gonna do anything great with it, for sure. No, they’re definitely gonna clone us in the future. But who cares? We’ll be dead. I think it’s kind of exciting. Right? A bunch of us fighting robots in the future. That’s exciting, right? Six of you running through a wheat field, with no private parts. [groaning] “Ah!” [audience laughing] Long hair like you never had. [moans] “Ah!” Learning karate and eating squirrel meat. It’s exciting! [laughter] But in the short-term, not only do you find out your family heritage, I expected that, but you also find out all your family secrets. I wasn’t expecting that. That’s very exciting. All the secrets come out when DNA shows up. There’s no hiding it. DNA is like the drunk uncle who comes to Christmas for the first time. He’s like, “Wait a minute. You think that’s your real dad?”', '[audience laughing]', '“Have I got a story for you!” [audience laughs] We knew, in my family, we were gonna be mostly Italian, and a little German that we don’t talk about. [audience laughing] When it came back, we were mostly Italian, a little German, and a little French. A little French thrown in. I called my mother. I said, “What’s with the French?” She said, “Oh, secret’s out!” “Your grandmother was a whore.” [audience roaring with laughter]', '[audience member] Whoo!', '“I’m sorry. What did you call Nana?” [audience laughing] “Yep, she was a whore, all right. Slept her way through Europe.” “That’s why you have weird eyebrows and your uncle’s gay.” [audience laughing] I don’t think that’s how it works. [audience laughs] No more secrets. No more secrets. DNA and social media. You know, I tour all over the country. People do their research, and they show up once in a while. “I think we’re related.” And I’ll call my mother. “Who’s Holly?” “What do you know?”', '[audience laughing]', '“I know there’s a middle-aged woman in Tampa who wants to come to Thanksgiving.” “And she looks a lot like Dad!” [audience laughing] “Oh, shit. She found us.” [audience laughing] Families had secrets, for generations. Long, deep secrets. Families kept secrets. Anything that embarrassed them in front of the neighbors, anything they didn’t understand, that made them uncomfortable, they would just lie about it or stick it in the attic. Just stick it in the attic. Unwanted baby? Put it in the attic. [audience laughing] Undiagnosed ADHD? Get her in the attic. “Is that your boy with a stutter?” “What boy?” Put him in the attic. [audience laughing] All over America, kids looking out of attic windows. “Where’s everybody g-g-g-g-going?” [audience laughing] “I want a b-b-backpack too!” [audience laughing] [Tom chuckles] It’s so sad. And as a child, if you had an inkling about a family secret, and you asked the elders about it, they’d lie right to your face. “Who’s that man living in the garage?” “What man?” [audience laughing] “There’s a man out there. He’s been there for quite some time.” “There’s no man out there.” “Yes, there is.” “Shut up!”', '[audience laughing]', 'What a great time to be a parent, by the way. Could you imagine? There was a time you could tell your kids to shut up, right to their face. [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] No long conversations. No explanations. Just “shut up!” [audience laughs] How much easier would that have been? [audience laughs] “Why is the sun hot?” “I don’t know. Why don’t you shut up?” [audience laughing] “Well, that was uncalled-for.” [audience laughs] Even easier to be a father back then. You weren’t even considered one of the parents. [audience laughing] You just had to show up and hit everyone once in a while. [audience laughing] My father would act like we were strangers who just broke into the TV room. “Where the hell did these kids come from? Get them out of here!” My mother would come. “Leave your father alone. He works hard.” “We were just playing.” “Well, now you’re just shutting up.” [audience laughs] [Tom chuckles] It was a different time. We had an uncle who couldn’t take it anymore. He just stood up in the middle of dinner and just walked out the front door. And didn’t come back. Just left my aunt and my cousins behind. And just left. We were like, “Where’s Uncle Bob?” And they lied right to our face. They said he went to Siberia.', '[audience laughing]', 'He wasn’t in Siberia. He went to his girlfriend’s apartment in the same town and lived there for two years. In the same town. We’d see him around. [audience laughing] We’d be in the supermarket. “Is that Uncle Bob?” [audience laughs] “No, that son of a bitch is in Siberia.” [audience laughing] “Looks a lot like Uncle Bob.” “Looks like you’re gonna shut the hell up.” [laughter and applause] [Tom chuckles] And then one day, he just walked back in, sat down, and kept eating. [audience laughs] Like nothing ever happened. We were like, “How was Siberia?” He was like, “That wasn’t her name.” [audience roars with laughter] [applause] [cheering and applause] [Tom chuckles] Things are better now. I think with the truth coming out, things are better. We’re actually helping people, not sticking things in the attic anymore. We’re dealing with mental health, helping each other out. It’s a much nicer time. Everyone’s going to therapy. Good for you. If you need someone to talk to and you go to therapy, good for you. I’m not going, but good for you!', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] I’m not right. There’s a lot needs to be fixed. But I’m having a good time. And I know if I go to therapy, they’re gonna stop it. [audience laughing] [applause]', '[cheering and applause]', '[Tom laughs] I know what’s wrong with me. I eat too much, and I drink too much. “Don’t you want to find out why?” [chuckles] I know why. Life is hard, and that stuff’s fun to do. [audience laughing] [chuckles] We all got stuff. Everyone’s dealing with stuff. Everybody in here’s got something. I still shoplift. [surprised laughter] [laughing] I do. You should do it too. It’s fun. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] You know when you’re a kid and you steal? I never got caught, and I’m still going. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’m undefeated. [audience laughing] Not big stuff. I’m not an ass. Little stuff, like dental floss and candy. Stuff like that. Stuff we shouldn’t have to pay for in the first place. [laughs] You know what I mean? Pens? I’m not paying for pens. I’m not giving you money for pens. I steal pens. CVS, Walgreens… You. If we’re hanging out, I would get your pen. [audience laughing] Try it. It’s really fun. Especially as an adult, they don’t really mess with you. Some 16-year-old manager of a CVS sees you sticking a Blow Pop in your pocket. “I don’t have time for this shit!”', '[audience laughing]', '[sighs] “Call the cops on my principal? This is ridiculous.” [audience laughing] The older I get, the more I’m gonna steal, for sure. [audience laughs] Oh yeah, when I’m 80, that’s all I’m gonna do. [audience laughs] Wake up in the morning, have coffee, go to Best Buy and roll that place. [audience laughing] “He’s back! What’s he got this time? Looks like a PlayStation.” [audience laughing] [applause] “Should we take it back?” “No, follow him to his car.” “He falls asleep before he turns it on. He’ll be all right.”', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom chuckles] Oh. Helping kids now, that’s better, you know? Helping kids out, that’s a good thing. When people have little problems, great teachers are helping them out. We didn’t have that. When I was a kid, we didn’t have great teachers. They were a hot mess. They had no answers for us. They just called me hyper. That’s what they would tell my parents. Every back-to-school night. “This kid’s hyper.” “He talks all day and makes friends in the middle of class.” Oh! We got to stop that shit immediately. [audience laughs] [laughs] They would show up, adjust their wigs, do a shot of Jack Daniel’s, and throw shit at us. [audience laughs] They were always throwing stuff at us. Erasers, chalk… My best friend got hit in the head with a dictionary. Yeah, right in his head. We didn’t need Adderall. We were focused. [audience laughing] [applause] [laughs] Our lives depended on it. We had a Spanish teacher. She used to come in so hungover, there was a 50% chance her boobs would pop out.', '[audience laughing]', '[laughs] We were focused. [audience laughing] Muy bien! Muy bien! [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] If you do go to therapy, just know, you’re gonna go forever. You gotta go forever. Because we don’t get fixed. There’s no fixing this. I’ve never had a friend come up, “Last day of therapy. I’m all better now.” [audience laughing] [laughs] It doesn’t work like that. We’re not… We’re physical beings. We’re constantly changing, constantly changing, evolving, and decaying. That affects you physically, and that affects your emotions, minute to minute, second to second. You can’t pay that much attention to yourself. We’re an ongoing project. Sometimes I really think my whole emotional makeup is completely dependent on what I ate that day. Ever had one of those days? “Cool Ranch Doritos? I haven’t had those in a while.” [munching] And a half hour later, I’m like, “I think I’m gonna kill myself.”', '[audience laughing]', '“Why are my eyes hot? I feel weird.”', '[audience laughing]', 'Always changing. I don’t know any of you, but I know for a fact, you’re slightly different now than when we started the show. Right? The weed’s wearing off. [audience laughs] The alcohol’s kicking in. Some of you didn’t get a chance to eat and you’re all cranky. Some ate too much. Now you’re all gassy and offending your neighbors. [audience laughs] Some of you are jammed in the middle. You thought about peeing? You really should have peed. You really should have peed. [audience laughs] [Tom laughs] We’re not supposed to be happy all the time. Don’t put pressure on yourself. Don’t feel like you’re less than because you’re not happy all the time. That’s a lie. That’s a social media construct. We’re not supposed to be happy all the time. Happy’s like a coke spike. It’s like way up there. You know? No one’s happy all the time. Clowns are happy all the time, and they freak everybody out.', '[audience laughing]', 'Walking around with permanent smiles. ‘Cause they’re killing things at night and thinking about it during the day. [audience laughing] We’re not supposed to be happy all the time. Happy’s way up here. Joyful, you should be joyful. But that’s down here. That’s down here. Joy is right down there. And depressed, right under it.', '[audience laughing]', 'Right there. Right there. So close to joy, and all day long, just “Zim, zam, zim, zam, zim.” [exclaims] “Zim, zam, zim.”', '[audience laughing] There’d be no comedy if we were happy all the time. We wouldn’t be here right now. This is how it works. You come in, we laugh for a couple of hours. As soon as it’s done, right back to Shitsville! [audience laughing] [laughs] Yeah. That’s what I called your life. Shitsville.', '[applause]', '[Tom laughs] It’s all right. I live there too. [audience laughs] [Tom laughs] Not supposed to be happy all the time. Think about all the paintings in all the great museums of all the great people who came before us, right? Queen Elizabeth, Joan of Arc, Washington, Jesus. Not one smile. You ever notice that? No one is smiling. There’s no paintings of Lincoln and his bros, like… [audience laughing] One famous smile, the Mona Lisa, and it’s a shit smile. [audience laughing] That’s the kind of smile you give to someone when they get on your elevator at the last minute. [audience laughing] [applause] “Couldn’t wait? Couldn’t wait? Okay.” “Now you’re pressing all the buttons. Great. Nice to have you.”', '[audience laughing]', 'Sometimes you just need perspective, to know that you’re doing all right. You know? I go to shitty bars. You ever do that? Every town’s got one. Do it. Do it. You know the bar I’m talking about. It’s weird, no windows. There’s just one porthole on the door. You never see anyone go in or out. The door has padding on it, for some reason. Go in there. Go in there in the middle of the afternoon and buy drinks for the 80-year-old guy sitting at that little crummy bar, under the saddest Christmas lights of all time. They’ve been hanging there since 1937. [audience laughs] Buy that guy some drinks. No one knows his name. They call him Popeye, but nobody really knows his name. Listen to his stories. How he fought in every war, lost money in every recession, has every STD known to man. After an hour of that, you come back out into the light. You’re like, “I think I can do this.” [audience laughing] [exhales] “I’m gonna be all right.” [cheering and applause] It’s hard to feel good. It’s hard to feel good. I don’t feel that great right now. Do you? I’m having a great time, but I don’t feel good. Do you feel good? No. Yeah. You feel fat. We all feel fat.', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] Yeah. Not fat, puffy, puffy.', 'Definitely puffy.', '[audience laughs] We could totally pee this out. Don’t you think? We could totally pee it. It’s just water weight. Water mixed with adult chicken fingers, and mac and cheese bites, and ice cream we eat standing up in the kitchen when our family’s asleep.', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] No, you don’t need me calling you fat. You know what’s wrong with you. [audience laughing] Might not be fat, might not be fat, but there’s something. There’s something you don’t like about you. We all carry it. I don’t know what it is, but you’re thinking about it right now. Maybe you got weird love handles. Maybe a misshapen nipple. I’ve seen a lot of those. The one that keeps wandering off to the right for no reason. Everybody’s looking this way, and she keeps going over there.', '[audience laughing]', 'A lot of feet. A lot of feet out there. A lot of feet. It’s feet season out there. I see ’em at the airport. A lot of bad feet out there. A lot of middle-aged women seem to be evolving right before our eyes, growing extra toes in real time. You ever see that? Next to the big toe, there’s a jut that comes out at the side. [imitates a monkey whooping] [audience laughing] Looks like it comes in handy at home, you know, raking the leaves, and… [audience laughing] …returning emails, and talking on the phone at the same time.', '[audience laughing]', 'You’re in public now. How about some socks? [audience laughing] We torture ourselves. It’s our brains. I think our brain’s main objective is to collect insults hurled at us throughout our life, store them, and play them over and over in a loop until we’re dead. [audience laughs] And even then, I bet it doesn’t stop. I bet it doesn’t stop. I bet I’ll be looking at myself in the coffin at the end, “Oh, I am disgusting. Look at me.” [audience laughs] “Why’d they put me in that tracksuit? I never wore that.” “How could I be dead and still look sweaty? I’m the worst.”', '[audience laughing]', 'Most of these insults, by the way, this weird, little, low self-esteem you have every once in a while, that’s from insults long ago. This isn’t fresh stuff. This is how long your brain has held on to it. No one insults you as an adult. When’s the last time in the supermarket, someone rolls up, “Nice waddle, fat ass”? [audience laughing] Standing behind you at the register. “You look poor.” [audience laughing] “I’m shopping for my family.”', '[audience laughing]', '[laughs] It was when you were little, when you first went to school all excited. “So long, everyone. I’m going to kindergarten.” And you walked into school all excited, and the other kids came running up, “You smell like ham.” [audience laughing] “Why would you say that? I’m here to color and make friends.” Thirty years later, walking through your house, “I’m not getting that promotion. Everyone knows I smell like ham.” [audience laughing] “They’re gonna give it to Donna. Everyone loves Donna.” “She smells like cookies.” [audience laughing] Only our brains, by the way. Only our brains. Other animals don’t have this problem. Your dog doesn’t have low self-esteem. Your dog doesn’t call himself a piece of garbage, even while he’s eating out of the garbage.', '[audience laughing]', 'He doesn’t sit on the couch afterwards and beat himself up. “What is wrong with me?” [audience laughing] “I have got to get my act together.” “I told everyone on New Year’s Eve, ‘no more garbage’.” [audience laughing] “I said it in front of a room full of people.” “They left that door open a crack. I lost my shit back there.” [audience laughing] “I can’t go for a walk looking like this.” [audience laughing] No, your dog eats the garbage, sits on the couch, “Thank you. I see what you did for me.”', '[audience laughing]', '“Thank you. I love you too.” “I ate it all. I ate it all.” “I even ate the bag. Yes, I did.” [audience laughing] “Yes, I did. You know why? Because I’m a good boy.” [audience laughing] “Yes, I am. I’m a good…” [mimics retching] “Oh, I’m sorry.” [audience laughing] “Oh God, I threw it up. I’m so sorry.” “Are you gonna clean that up? No, no, no.” “I’m gonna eat that too.” [audience roars with laughter] [applause] “You do for me, I do for you.” [audience laughing] “I think there’s an avocado pit stuck in my ass.”', '[audience laughing]', '“Don’t worry. We’ll deal with it on Wednesday when you’re late for work.” “Don’t worry about it now.” [audience laughing] Got to be more like your dog. Treat yourself like your dog treats themselves. Really. Cut yourself some slack. You know? Don’t be so hard on yourself. What’s the objective here, friends? What is it? To look amazing? No, it’s to stay alive. That’s it. Just stay alive. That’s all you gotta do. And you’re here tonight, so you did it. Congratulations. [cheering and applause] [Tom chuckles] Well… [Tom laughs] I don’t know if it really necessitates applause, really. [audience laughs] [laughs] It’s a lot of momentum at this point, isn’t it? [laughing] Yeah. It turns out it’s not that hard to stay alive. All these close calls you’ve had in your life, and you’re still going. You’re still going. Constantly. Just constant close calls. And every time there is a close call, everyone else thinks it’s hilarious, don’t they? “Dude, that bus was this close!”', '[Tom laughs]', '[audience laughing] “Dude, how long were you under the raft at the pool party? Oh my God!” [audience laughs] Constantly choking on stuff. I once got a Pachinko ball stuck in my brain. Know what Pachinko is? It’s like pinball, but with these little ball bearings. And when I was a kid, I realized the ball bearing fit perfectly in my nose. I thought, “This will be hilarious. I’ll put one in this nostril.” “Then I’ll close this nostril and shoot it at my friend’s face.” [audience laughing] Good joke. I got it all set up, and then I realized how funny it was gonna be, and I inhaled. [audience laughing] I don’t know where it went. [audience laughing] It was a weird trip to the emergency room. “Get it out!” It was so embarrassing. “He thinks he’s funny. Tell him what you did.” “Tell him what you did.” [whimpers]', '[audience laughing]', '“Just get it out.” A lot of close calls. We’re always electrocuting ourselves. Constantly. How many times have you, like, “bzz, bzz.” Everywhere you go. Why is it we all know what batteries taste like? [audience laughing] [laughs] Because we’re stupid, and we’re lucky to be here. [audience laughing] I had a college roommate. This guy used to drink grain alcohol straight, and then he’d light his farts in front of everybody. Nightly. Nightly. Even that guy is still alive. [audience laughing] [laughs] He is. He’s a lawyer in Phoenix.', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] People come to him with their problems. They have no idea he’s just a twitchy brain stem in a suit. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] I’m surprised we’re alive from all the food we eat in this country. Oh my God! We have a good time, but we don’t eat well. We’re the only country that has a nationwide hot-dog-eating contest. Hot-dog-eating contest. A hot dog is the worst thing you can put in the human body. They’ve done studies that every hot dog you eat takes 30 minutes off of your life. That should be a national emergency. [audience laughs] Does it stop us? Hell no! Instead, we have a contest and put it on ESPN on the 4th July, to shine a light on the best and brightest of us all. [audience laughing]', '[cheering and applause]', '[Tom laughs] We feed them to our children at the barbecue. We yell, “You get off that trampoline, put out your cigarette, and eat this hot dog.” [audience laughing] “Show some respect.” But who cares, right? Thirty minutes off your life. It’s not like it comes off tonight. [audience laughs] It’s not like you eat the hot dog today and lose it this evening. No, it’s at the end, when it’s weird and scary. So you’re telling me, with every hot dog I eat, I have 30 minutes less of staring at a wall in a nursing home. [audience laughing] Waiting for a stranger to change me. [audience laughing] Sounds to me like hot dogs are a superfood. [audience laughing and cheering] [cheering and applause] [Tom laughs] Seems like we should be eating hot dogs with every meal. [laughs] They should redo that food pyramid and put a hot dog on top.', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] I know there’s pressure. I know there’s pressure. There’s always a lot of pressure. I don’t want to make you feel bad about yourself, or add to your feelings of low self-esteem. You’re beautiful. You’re all beautiful. You really are. You’re miracles. This is insane that we’re here in this moment at all. That somehow, all this stardust in this vast, crazy universe somehow came together and cobbled together you! You’re a miracle, and you’re sitting next to another miracle. We’re all miracles. I know it’s hard to think that sometimes. When you stop at 7-Eleven around midnight on your way home. [audience laughing] Not exactly crawling with miracles. [audience laughing] It looks like a lot of mistakes. [audience laughing] [laughs] That’s okay. They’re miracles too. They’re just making weird choices, that’s all. No, you’re all beautiful. I’m attracted to all of you right now. Mostly ’cause you’re covered up. Let’s be honest, right? Everyone’s got their own style. Everyone looks great. A couple hours from now, we peel these layers off…', '[groans] Oy-he-he-he.', '[audience laughs] Different story. A lot of weird dangly bits. Strange Jack and the Beanstalk hairs coming out of your ass. Things growing on your body you didn’t think grew on a human. “Is that a barnacle? What am I?” [audience laughing] “What am I, a boat?” I don’t like seeing myself naked, honestly. I come out the shower. I’m the only one in the bathroom. I catch myself in the mirror. “Oh!” [audience laughs] I towel up immediately, like a fancy lady, from tits to thighs. [audience laughing] Like a pig in a blanket, with one soft serve towel on top. [audience laughing] My nipples used to be up here. [audience laughing] They were here. I saw a picture of me in high school. They were here. They’re here now. They’re here. Really, they were here. They’re now down… I’m touching them right now. They’re here. [audience laughing] It’s like they quit and walked off the job. [audience laughing] No two weeks’ notice. Just flipped over the desk, gave me the finger, and made a run for it. And they’re still on the move. They’re still on the move. I never catch ’em, but they’re moving. They’re like two ex-cons in a wheat field. [audience laughing] When I’m 80, they’re gonna be in my pockets.', '[audience laughing]', 'It’s hard to feel good about yourself, especially with social media. Every time you open up your phone, there’s some people that look great. They’re always calling you a loser, because you don’t live like them, right? You get all these cold plunge people on your feeds. You get these jackasses. Act like you’re a loser if you don’t start off at 6:00 a.m. in a bucket of ice water. Shut the hell up. Get off of my phone. I’m gonna do a video about the benefits of a long hot shower. That’s a winner, where you just keep making it hotter and hotter and hotter, and then you stay an extra 15 minutes, and you come out like a wet noodle, and cancel all your appointments for the day. That’s a winner.', '[cheering and applause]', '[Tom laughs] All these guys always showing me their abs. They’ve always got their shirt off where it should be on. Like at a school or a bus stop. “You want abs like these?” [chuckles] “No, honestly.” What am I gonna do with those abs? Nothing. They’re not gonna help my life at all. I’m not impressed by those guys. I feel bad for those guys. I know they’re alone. They have to be alone. You can’t live with another person and have abs like that, doing crunches under the coffee table 24 hours a day. When they’re trying to watch their shows. No one’s gonna stand for that. No, they live alone in a one-bedroom apartment with a pull-up bar, eating protein shakes, and shitting like a goat.', '[audience laughing]', 'They don’t impress me. You impress me. People who live with other people in a family. That’s impressive. You think abs can do what you do? Get a whole family ready for school on a Tuesday morning in the dark? Making individual breakfasts for every needy bastard in your house? ‘Cause God forbid they eat the same thing on the same damn day. They never do that. And then feed all the animals at the same time? And clean what pops out the other side of them almost immediately? [audience laughs] Then drop them all off at school. Then pick them up at the end of the day, 20 minutes later. [audience laughing] Then drive them around like you’re their Uber driver the rest of the afternoon, taking them to all their dumb activities they can’t even do. [audience laughing] No way. You think abs is gonna sit in a little chair at a dentist’s office? Flipping through a sticky magazine, just waiting for the dentist to come out and give you a $5,000 bill?', '[audience laughs]', 'A $5,000 bill, because the little bastard stopped brushing his teeth. [audience laughing] And you knew it. You knew it. You knew he wasn’t brushing his teeth. But you stopped asking, because you didn’t want to ruin bedtime every night. You got tired of being the bad guy. You checked the brush, you checked the brush, and it was wet, but that was a lie. [audience laughing] [applause and cheering] That was a lie. [laughs] That was a con job. He was wetting his brush, sitting on the toilet, probably looking at porn on his phone. [audience laughing] And now you have a $5,000 bill.', '[audience laughing]', 'But as crazy as that house is, you know, and costly, I would much rather live with all those heartbeats, all those needy heartbeats, than live alone with my abs. You know? ‘Cause on some level, your family has to be grateful. They’ll never say thank you. They’ll never say, “Thanks for keeping us alive.” But that’s literally what you’re doing. You’re literally keeping them alive. Without you, they’re dead. They’re dead. [audience laughing] I could leave my daughters with a can and a can opener, come back 24 hours later, dead! [audience laughing] Dead. They’ll never say thank you, so don’t wait for it. Gotta draw it out of ’em. When you see them tomorrow, “My friend last night told me to remind you, without me, you’re dead!” “Or worse, no teeth. You’d have no teeth.” “Like a jack-o’-lantern in December.” [audience laughing] “Going to school with a smushed-in face…” [audience laughing] “…wishing you were dead.” [audience laughing] “So you’re welcome.” [audience laughs] No, so I block all those people on Instagram. I don’t have those guys on my Instagram feed. The only thing on my feed are bakers. That’s it. Just bakers. I love baking bread. I can’t stop baking.', '[cheering and applause]', 'I love it. My whole algorithm is nothing but bread. Bread and babies. That’s all I got. My favorite guy… Oh, you’d love him. He’s two feet tall. He’s five feet wide. He’s just a French baker. He’s just one ab. He’s just… [audience laughs] He’s just one buttery ab. And he bakes croissants. That’s all he does. He bakes croissants. He puts them in the oven, bakes them, breaks them out, cracks them open. Steam comes out. Then he eats them on camera, and I get aroused. [audience laughing] Food is my love language, or my family’s love language. That’s how we all communicate, through food. My mom would make salami sandwiches for me every day for school. That’s how I could tell how much she loved me at the moment. If I got one salami sandwich, not that great. If I got three, I was a good boy.', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] They used to call me Tommy Salami. That’s how many salami sandwiches I’d eat. They just visited me, my parents. Oh my God. I love ’em to death. But two weeks, they came to my house. No hotel, two weeks. Didn’t ask, just showed up. [audience laughs] Two weeks! That’s not a visit. That’s an insurrection. [audience laughing] Man. My father is so cheap. He picked the date they had to be there, and the one before and after it, until it was cheap enough, and then he bought the tickets. I would have paid. I would have paid.', '[audience laughing]', 'I would have paid for the flight, or a hotel, or a sniper. [audience laughing] [Tom chuckles] I love ’em to death. Don’t get me wrong. I love ’em to death. It’s a blessing to have your parents. It really is. But, oh my God, it’s a lot. [audience laughs] My mother was, like… She was so cute. She’s like, “Don’t worry.” “We’re not gonna be a bother. We’re just gonna hang around.” “It’s not even gonna be like we’re there. You don’t have to entertain us.” “We just want to be around.” “All right.” Yeah, right. I’d try to sneak into the kitchen, early in the morning, get one cup of coffee before it all starts. They’re just sitting there at the counter, like two lonely sea lions. [audience laughing] [wails] [audience laughing] [wails] They’ve been waiting since 4:00 in the morning. [audience laughing] [wails] “We didn’t know when you were gonna get up.” [wails]', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] When people stay with you, there’s no activity that eats up enough hours of the day. You take them to the beach. “There’s the ocean.” “All right, back to the house.” “Twelve more hours till bedtime.”', '[groans]', '[audience laughing] [chuckles] The problem is, they have no activities, they have no hobbies. They don’t crossword-puzzle, they don’t pickleball, Sudoku, nothing. They’re just two Italian parents who eat. They just eat and then talk about what they ate last night. And they talk about what they’re gonna eat tonight, and is there time to eat in between? They’re like two retired raccoons just going through my kitchen. [audience laughing] My mother was dumpster diving under the kitchen sink, looking for scraps. “There’s still meat on this chicken bone.” “I don’t know why you threw that out, Mr. Big Shot.” [audience laughing] My father was talking to me, eating a cookie. He dropped it by mistake, stepped on it, peeled it off the bottom of his shoe, and ate it! [audience laughing] Right in front of me! [audience laughs] I was like, “What are you doing?” He looked at me like a toddler who knows he’s in trouble but doesn’t know why. [audience laughing] I’m like, “No shoe cookies! No shoe cookies!”', '[audience laughing]', '“Why are you eating a shoe cookie right now?” He’s like, “That? No, come on. I beat it. Five-second rule. I beat it.” It’s not how it works. If you drop a cookie in the toilet, you don’t get to eat it if you’re quick. [audience laughing] [laughs] I love ’em to death. Look, I know it’s a complicated relationship. If you’re lucky enough to still have your parents around, it’s a blessing. But I know you feel guilty a lot of the times. Because sometimes they call, you don’t pick up. Then when you do pick up, you get impatient, because they can’t use the phone. You say something mean before you hang up. I know you feel guilty a lot of the times. But don’t, don’t, because I got news for you. They’re not saying great things about you either. [audience roaring with laughing] [applause and cheering] I guarantee you my father was in the guest room at night, “We’ve gotta get the hell out of here.” “Mr. Big Shot won’t let me eat shoe cookies.” [audience laughing] “Who the hell does he think he is?” “I got you one, by the way, if you want.” [audience laughing] “A little nightcap.”', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] And now it’s putting family in perspective for me. Now that my kids are leaving, I’m gonna be them. I’m gonna be them. You know? I’m gonna wanna just hang around. I’m gonna want my kids to like me, and all that kind of stuff. [sighs] I love family. It’s a great thing. I come from a big family. I love family. But it’s a heartbreaker at the same time. You’re gonna get your feelings hurt. You can’t have that much love without getting your heart broken. It’s the same as when people buy those big dogs. I never understand these people. They get these giant dogs. They’re all filled with fur and love. And they take over the whole house. And everyone falls in love with them. And they’re dead in three months. [audience laughs] I couldn’t take that heartbreak. I need something small and shitty that’s just gonna twitch and pee on itself for 25 years. [audience laughing] Losing limbs, one at a time. Eyes popping out. “I’m still with you, Tommy. I’m still with you.”', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] I have a friend that just got a Great Dane. Are you high? [audience laughing] A Great Dane? That dog should come with a shovel. [audience laughing] Couldn’t handle it. It’s the same with the kids. They take up the whole house. And then, before you know it, they’re on their way out. They don’t remember the first five years you did that stuff for them. They have no memory of it. Then the last four years, they’re trying to get away. So you get, what, eight years in the middle? I’m not sure it’s worth it. [audience laughing] I told my daughter before she left, “Just so you know, I did all of this for you.” “I did all of this for you.” “I didn’t want this house. I didn’t want to live in this town.” “I didn’t want any of these animals.” “I don’t even have friends anymore. All my friends are your friends’ parents.” [audience laughing] “I did this all for you, and now you’re gonna go?” “I should go.” [audience laughing] “You can have it all.”', '[cheering and applause]', '“Just give me a backpack with a Van Halen CD and some weed.” “And I’ll go back to living the life I was living before I met you.” [cheering and applause] Oh, but I love ’em so much. So funny. You don’t really plan your life, do you? It just kind of unfolds. It just kind of happens. You have a couple of ideas, but it just kind of happens. I didn’t know I’d be at this point in my life, talking about this family. It just happened. I just got tired of eating pizza by myself. I was eating pizza by myself all the time. “This is getting depressing.” I was eating pizza by myself when I saw a pretty girl. I was like, “You want to eat pizza with me?” [audience laughs] She was like, “Yeah. I’m always eating pizza by myself.” “Me too. Let’s eat pizza together.” “Okay.” [munching]', '[audience laughing]', 'Then five years later, we’re going through the airport, through security, with a naked toddler and a cat carrier, breaking down a stroller with our feet at 6:00 a.m., sweating our asses off. And our life was over. It was over. [audience laughing] All because I couldn’t eat pizza by myself. [audience laughing] And I can’t tell you what you should do with your life. I don’t know. Have kids, not have kids. Who knows? Get married, not get married. You know? But for me, it was worth it. For me, this whole thing was worth it, because now I know, at the end, there’ll be someone to pick up the phone. You know? At the end, there’ll be someone there to pick up the phone when the police call… [audience laughing] …and say they found me swimming in the fountain at the mall again. [audience laughing] “Come on down. No, he’s having a good time. No rush.”', '[audience laughing]', '“No, his pants are on this time. He’s actually having a good time.” [audience laughing] “Kids are throwing pennies at him. He doesn’t even feel it.” [audience laughing] “He might have stolen a PlayStation. We’ll talk about it when you get here.”', '[laughter and applause]', '[Tom laughs] [cheering and applause] [Tom laughs] [Tom laughs] We’re all going the same way, though. Whatever you choose, we’re all going off the same brochure. We’re all headed the same way. You know? If you’re young here tonight, and you see an old person, I know you don’t think that that’s you in the future. You look at an old person, that’s not you in the future. That’s like looking at a sequoia tree or a unicorn. [audience laughing] But it is going to be you one day, before you know it. If you’re older and look at a young person and think, “I still look like that,” you don’t. You don’t. [audience laughing] [applause] You don’t. I know it’s a cliché, but I’m turning into my father. It’s happening. I’m not planning it. I just bought a three-pack of silicone spray the other day.', '[audience laughing]', 'I don’t even know what it is. [audience laughing] I don’t know what people use it for, but I knew it was a deal, so I bought it. [audience laughing] Just like my father would. And now I’m gonna give one away to the mailman for no reason. [audience laughing] Just like my father. We all think we’re young, and strong, and healthy, and you all look beautiful tonight. But before you know it, you’re gonna be in line at the airport, at the gate, you’re gonna be wearing a neck pillow, thinking it’s cool. And you’re gonna break into old people exercises, out of nowhere. Just gonna start doing some of these.', '[audience laughing]', 'We’re gonna be those old people who start coughing, out of nowhere. Not eating anything, not drinking anything, and they just explode! [loud cough] [audience laughing] Turning purple. The eyes popping out. [groans loudly] And then they just stop and continue with the conversation. [audience laughing] “Are we gonna talk about what just happened?” “You literally almost died a second ago.” “No? All right. Continue with the story I’ve heard a thousand times.” “This is great.”', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] It’s hard to be an old person nowadays, though. It’s hard. Can’t even retire anymore. They keep raising the retirement age. That’s not cool. That’s not nice to the old people. That’s not nice to the young people who have to work with old people that long. Do you… [laughs] Do you really want an 80-year-old pilot? Really? [audience laughs] “Buckle up. We’re going to Dayton! I mean Denver. You know what I mean.” [audience laughing] [sighs] “I’m so tired.” [audience laughing] “I should have retired a while ago, but they won’t let me.” “I’m close to death, and so are you!” [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] If we’re gonna make old people work, let’s have fun with them. Rent ’em out. Rent them out to people who want to take the carpool lane. [audience laughing] Tell them they’re going to work. You get to the office, drop ’em off, someone takes them the other way. [audience laughing] “Are we almost there?” [laughs] “You were already there.” “I was?” [audience laughing] “Didn’t even eat my lunch.”', '[audience laughing]', '[Tom laughs] Rent them out to people who do those haunted hayrides. Just drop six old people in the woods along the path. [audience laughing] [Tom laughing] I don’t mean to mock old people. I really don’t. I want to be old people. I want you all to be old people. That would be a blessing, you know? It’ll be great. I’ll still be on tour. I’ll come to your nursing home. I’ll tell jokes. You won’t be able to laugh. You’ll just blink and fart at me. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] I want to live till I’m one of those guys that starts dressing like a sea captain for no reason. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] You ever see these guys? They don’t have a boat, they don’t live near the ocean. They just show up like Captain Crunch one day.', '[audience laughing]', '“Toot, toot!” Got the hat, the buttons, the whole thing. And we just have to go along with it. [audience laughing] I hope you have a good rest of your year. I do. You know, enjoy yourself. I don’t think it’s gonna be a great year.', 'Uh…', '[audience laughing] Seems like it’s gonna be pretty annoying. I’d say turn off the news once in a while, but it’s getting tougher to do. Everyone’s got dumb phones in your pocket. Every time you open them, “Ah!” Another jackass yelling at you, right? “I just want to find a coffee place.”', '“Oh! Ah!”', '[audience laughs] Terrifying, these phones. I had to describe to my nephew the other day what “nuclear Armageddon” was. Yeah. Thanks for that, TikTok. [audience laughing] The kid had no idea what it was. He’s 17 years old, by the way. Yeah. I was like, “Maybe there’s an advantage to being a C-student. Good for you.” [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] Everyone’s yelling at him to read more. He was happy until a week ago. [audience laughing] I was like, “Yeah, look. Yeah, look, we’re all gonna die one day, and there’s a way we could all die on the same day.” [audience laughing] So don’t worry about it. You can know too much in this world. You can know too much. You don’t need all this information. Just because it’s feeding us all the time, doesn’t mean you need it. You don’t need it all. You know? Sure, you can die in a nuclear attack. You could also die in a squirrel attack. I saw that on YouTube. It’s a horrible death. They gouge out your eyes and fill you with nuts.', '[audience laughing]', 'You can know too much in this world, my friends. If someone gives you a chocolate chip cookie, you don’t think about what’s in that cookie. You don’t think about all the butter, and the fat, and the sugar, and salt. Made with someone’s hands. Someone’s hands!', '[audience laughing]', 'They say it like it’s a good thing. “Here’s a handmade cookie.” [audience laughing] [laughter continues] [Tom chuckles] Don’t think about that. Someone gives you a cookie, “Thank you!” [munching] [audience laughing] Do you want to know all your friends’ political views? [chuckles] Not if you want friends, you don’t! [audience laughing] Don’t ask those questions. You can know too much. I’ll be honest with you. I don’t want to know what my wife is thinking about most things most of the time. [audience laughing] We’ve been happily married for 24 years. You know why? We don’t ask dumb questions. [audience laughs] [cheering and applause] “Are you happy right now?” “Is there anything I should change about myself?” We don’t ask those questions. You want to be happily married? Shut up and keep going.', '[audience roaring with laughter]', '[cheering and applause]', '[Tom laughs] Couples therapy? Are you high? [audience laughs] Pay a stranger to pick at your old fights? Hell no! I tell my wife every night, “Look, you’re a mess. I’m a mess.” “Let’s watch a show.” [audience laughing] I’ll be honest with you. She doesn’t like me right now. She hasn’t for, like, two months. I have no idea why. And I’m not gonna find out. [audience laughing] [applause] She’ll come back. She’ll come back. Twenty-four years. She’ll forget. She’ll come back. No, I love her to death. We’re so solid. If we didn’t get divorced from all the animals we live with, we’re gonna be fine. I said when we were getting married, “I’d love to start a family with you.” “That sounds wonderful. I don’t need pets.” She said, “I don’t need pets either.” And she lied right to my face.', '[audience laughing]', 'My wife and daughters went out and got different animals every single week. I live in this weird Noah’s ark. You should see it. Birds and fish and lizards. We have a lizard. It has a life expectancy of 50 years.', '[audience laughing]', 'And it knows it. It knows it. [audience laughing] Just hangs out on his branch and looks at me, like… [laughs mockingly] “We both know who’s winning this race.” [audience laughing] Two crazy dogs. We have this pug named Frank. The thing is hilarious. [cheering and applause] It’s like living with an alien. It snores while it eats. [audience laughs] Who does that? He’s standing at his bowl, he’s chewing and he’s swallowing. He’s awake. His eyes are closed. He’s snoring. He’s asleep. [audience laughing] On Thanksgiving, I went to move the cutting board, after I carved the turkey, and all the juice came running down the bridges of it, off the edge, right onto his face. I never saw a dog laugh before.', '[audience laughing]', 'He was so happy for half of the day. Then the other half, he was miserable. He smelled turkey but didn’t know where it was coming from. [audience laughing] [snoring] [audience laughing] And we’ve got this giant black lab, who shits like a man. [audience laughing] Never seen anything like it. And I have to scoop it up and bring it back to the house, like I’m bringing in wood for the storm. [audience laughing] And a cat, a psychotic serial killer cat, who just kills for fun. Doesn’t eat any of it. Just rips it to pieces and drops it off. Here’s a bird with no head. “Oh!” [audience laughs] “Why would you do that?” He looks at me like, “Why would you ask me this question?” [audience laughing] “I give you a gift, and this is how you treat me?”', '[audience laughing]', 'It brings in live rats and drops them in the laundry room. Live rats! He goes to the yard, gets rats, drags them in by their neck, like the rat owes us money. [audience laughing] Of course my wife and I aren’t gonna like each other all the time. We’re now a rat-catching team. This is how we spend our time. I’m good with the magazine. I can get it into the corner, you know? I can pin it. But then the three of us are looking at each other. My wife, the rat, and I. Someone’s got to make a move. Someone’s got to grab this rat by its ass and get it outside. And I’ll be honest with you. I’m not doing it. [audience laughing] I didn’t want these animals. I’m not grabbing a rat trying to bite me. I’m good at faking it. Like I’m really trying, you know?', '[audience laughing]', '“They’re so fast.”', '[audience laughing]', '[laughs] My wife does it. She gets impatient. She grabs it and looks at me. “You sissy.” And takes it outside. I’ll be honest with you. That’s why I don’t like her sometimes. [audience laughs] Who does that? Now I’ve got to compartmentalize that I’m not married to old “Rat Fingers” Johnson.', '[audience laughing]', 'The love of my life is now covered in rat fingers. “Oh, you don’t want to fool around? Maybe I’ll make you a cookie.”', '[audience laughing]', 'Thank you so much for coming. You guys were great.', '[cheering and applause]', 'Thank you so much. Take care of yourselves. I’ll see you next time around.', '[cheering and applause]', '[“Soul Man” by The Blues Brothers plays]', '♪ Comin’ to ya ♪', '♪ On a dusty road ♪', '♪ Good lovin’ ♪', '♪ I got a truckload ♪', '♪ And when you get it ♪', '♪ You got something ♪', '[upbeat music playing]'], ['[crowd cheering]', 'Thank you all for coming to the show tonight. I do appreciate it. In case you guys don’t know why I’m on tour right now, as of a couple of months ago, I’ve been doing stand-up comedy for 20 years.', '[audience cheers]', 'Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My agent said to me, “Anthony, 20 years is a major accomplishment for any comedian.” “You gotta celebrate.” “Pick some of your favorite cities, go perform for them.” And I said, “No, thank you.”', '[audience chuckles]', '“I’d rather go to Milwaukee.”', '[audience laughs and applauds]', 'But look… [audience chuckles] …I am excited to be here tonight. I’ve got great news. After 20 years of stand-up comedy, just last weekend, I finally perfected my act. [audience chuckles] Don’t get me wrong. I thought it was perfect before. [audience chuckles] Ran into an audience member after my show last Saturday who told me different. [audience chuckles] Last Saturday night, I’m doing a show in New York. After my set, I’m trying to get out to the car. A woman from the audience chases me down, practically tackles me. She says, “Anthony, that last joke you told tonight, your closer.” “I’ve gotta tell you, that joke is problematic.” “You need to think about it, and you need to change it.” So I changed it. And now it’s my opener.', '[audience laughs]', '[cheering and applauding]', 'So, what I’m gonna do is I’m gonna tell you that joke. Explain what happened with that woman. And then nail home the point that I’m the best.', '[audience cheers and applauds]', 'Now, as a comedian, I’ve got a responsibility. A responsibility that I take very seriously. The responsibility to get up in front of a group of strangers and give you my opinion on the trans community.', '[audience chuckles]', 'Yeah. That’s right.', '[scattered cheering and applause]', 'Look, guys. You’ve got to do it now. It’s in the handbook. Now, I feel… I feel like the trans community are the new pregnant women. [audience chuckles] Just in that… [clicks tongue] …it is never polite to guess.', '[audience laughs]', 'Guys, you’ve got to trust me on this. You never… you never want to be like, “Hey.” “How far along are you?”', '[audience laughs]', '“Are you going to keep it or…?”', 'No.', '[audience laughs]', 'No, don’t do that. Even if you’re right, it’s rude. [audience chuckles] Do what I do. I’m smooth with it. I don’t ask the question. If I want to find something out, I just offer you a drink. “Here, have this glass of bourbon.” And if they say, “Actually, Anthony, I’m seven months pregnant,” then I get to be like, “Oh my God, you look amazing.” [audience laughs] But if they take the drink, they’re trans.', '[audience laughs]', '[scattered cheers]', 'Now, obviously… obviously, that’s a closer. [audience chuckles] I could leave right now. It’d be fine.', '[audience chuckles]', 'But this woman grabs me. Starts arguing with me. She says, “Anthony, I’ve gotta ask you, what is your intention with that trans joke?” I said, “Well, my intention is to make trans people laugh.” I mean, could you imagine? That would be historic.', '[audience laughs]', 'And she says, “Well, Anthony…” “Anthony, you’re probably not even aware of this, but the problem with your joke is some trans people are insecure about the fact that they can’t have kids of their own.” “And your joke makes it sound like you’re saying the opposite of a pregnant woman is a trans woman, and that could be hurtful.” And I agree. [audience chuckles] That could be hurtful. But not coming from me. [clicks tongue] You see, I love trans people. I empathize with the trans community. I’m not trans myself. But I, too, am always getting yelled at for walking into the wrong bathroom. [audience laughs] I love trans people. You know what I hate? Pregnant women.', '[audience laughs and applauds]', 'I mean, fuck those chubby bitches, am I right? They shouldn’t be allowed to play sports. [audience laughs] Now, look. Look, I will admit… I will admit that was a learning moment for me. Before that woman grabbed me, I didn’t know that trans people hated pregnant women as much as I do. [audience laughs] Makes me respect them all the more. So, just in case anyone here tonight is trans and you were offended by my first joke, here’s a joke I tailor wrote just for you to enjoy. Last week I saw a pregnant woman get hit by a bus. [audience chuckles] Or as I like to call it, a gender reveal party.', '[audience groans and laughs]', '[cheering and applause]', 'What are you guys laughin’ at? That’s not for you. That’s just for my trans friends. Don’t like pregnant women. Don’t like kids. One of my friends just asked me if I would be the sperm donor for her baby. I said, “I don’t know. That’s a pretty big decision.” “How old is your baby?”', '[audience laughs]', '[cheers and applause]', 'If you’re walkin’ in late, I hate kids. [audience chuckles] I hate them so much. It’s my whole thing. And what surprises me is now that I’m getting older, I’ve got friends, family members having kids of their own. And I don’t judge. Throw your life away. [audience chuckles] What surprises me is these people will text me pictures of their kids. “Anthony will want to see this. Send.” I never want to see that. [audience chuckles] The only time a kid shows up on my phone and I’m happy about it, Amber alert.', 'Otherwise…', '[audience laughs]', 'Otherwise, do not get my hopes up. [audience chuckles] I used to ignore those texts from my friends. Pretend I didn’t see ’em. Never respond. Then my sister had a kid. Started getting mad at me. She’d be like, “Really, Anthony? No response?” “You got nothing to say about this picture of your beautiful niece fucking up finger painting?” [audience chuckles] So I came up with a plan. Now, anytime, anytime anyone texts me a picture of their kids, I write back the exact same response. “Thanks.” [audience chuckles] “Gonna save this one for later.”', '[audience groans and laughs]', 'Yup. No, that works. You guys can use that. It works. I haven’t heard from my sister in a year. It’s the best. Mm-hmm. Like a lot of people, I spent most of the pandemic stuck inside, starin’ at the walls, goin’ crazy. I started buyin’ weird shit online. Decided I was gonna redecorate my place. I don’t know anything about interior design. But I know what I like. So I went on eBay, and I paid $500 for a child’s coffin. [audience chuckles] I thought, “This’ll be great. It’s vintage.” [audience chuckles] You put that in your living room, it’s a conversation starter.', 'You know?', '[audience laughs] But like so many of the things we bought online during the pandemic, I regret it now. Thing finally showed up in the mail. Empty.', '[audience chuckles]', 'I know. I know. Look. Guys, guys, guys. I hate kids so goddamn much. [audience chuckles] I can’t talk to kids these days. The other day, my little nephew came up to me. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I’ve been getting bullied by another kid in school.” I said, “Don’t put up with that.” “Break his nose.” “He’ll leave you alone.” He said, “Uncle Anthony, that’s toxic masculinity.” [audience chuckles] Well, I wasn’t gonna put up with that. [audience laughs] Listen, you guys came out here to have a good time on a Saturday night. I know what you want. You want to talk politics. Let’s go. [audience chuckles] Let me tell you what’s wrong with this country. Let me tell you what the problem is with the United States of America. In this country, you’ve gotta be 16 years old to drive a car, right? That makes sense. But you’ve gotta be 18 years old to be considered an adult. To vote. I think that’s fucked up. I think if you’re old enough and mature enough to safely drive a car on the street, then I should be allowed to have sex with you. Right? [audience groans and laughs] Anyway… [audience chuckles] That’s the only problem with this country.', '[audience cheers]', 'Now, as of this weekend, I’ve been on tour with this material for 18 months. And my favorite thing about touring around the country with these jokes the past 18 months has been telling that last joke in the South. [audience laughs] Guys, I have learned so much about this great country of ours. Right at the beginning of this tour, 18 months ago, I was doing a show in Alabama. Told them that joke. Guy in the audience stands up and says, “Anthony, I hate to break it to you, but the age of consent in Alabama is 16, so you gotta change that.” [audience chuckles] I said, “Oh, yeah?” You got to change that. And then a couple of weeks later, I did a show in Mississippi. Told them that joke then told them about Alabama. [audience chuckles] Guy in the audience stands up and says, “In Mississippi, the age of consent is 14.” And I said, “Ho-ly shit.” [audience laughs] That’s perfect.', '[audience laughs]', 'I mean… That is what the Founding Fathers were all about. You know? I have a friend who works for the FBI. He pretends to be a 12-year-old girl. Goes on the Internet and chats with child molesters all day. I don’t know what he does for the FBI, but it’s gotta be…', '[audience laughs and applauds]', 'I feel like the big new thing I keep hearing more and more about these days is porn addiction. I feel like every time I turn around, someone is complaining about their porn addiction. Not me. [audience chuckles] I can handle my shit. [audience laughs] But a couple of months ago, I’m at a family reunion. Big Jeselnik family reunion. Everyone is there. And the very first night, we’re all in this giant ballroom, eating dinner together as a family when my cousin stands up. He’s 15 years old. He says, “I have an announcement to make.” “I just want to tell you all that I’ve been suffering from a porn addiction.” “And it’s terrible.” “But I’m doing my best to get over it.” No one in my family knows what to say. Generations of Jeselniks are just staring straight ahead. Trying to eat their dinner. So I stood up. [audience chuckles] I said, “Hey, man.” “We can watch something else.”', '[audience laughs]', '“Look, I can put the game on if you want.” But when’s the next time we’re all gonna be together, you know? [clicks tongue] I don’t have a porn addiction. I watch a healthy amount of porn. [audience chuckles] I’ve got my favorites. Hell, I was in a bar the other night, saw my favorite porn star of all time sitting at the end of the bar by herself. I couldn’t believe it. I called the bartender over, “Man, I’ll have another beer.” “And see that girl down there?” “She shouldn’t be here. She’s 13.” [audience groans and laughs] Now, this is where audiences traditionally start to complain. [audience chuckles] They’ll say, “Anthony, why do you have so many jokes about abusing children?” “And why do you do them all in the beginning?” And this is where I kind of have to stop the show for a minute. And I explain to the audience the concept of gallows humor. Gallows humor is what I’m all about. Gallows humor is when you see something in the world that is so horrible that you have to laugh at it. Otherwise, it would destroy you. A couple of months ago, I’m reading the newspaper, and I come across an article about a priest in my hometown who just got arrested for molesting an altar boy at the exact same church where I was an altar boy growing up. That was horrifying to read. That could’ve been me. If I had become a priest.', '[audience laughs]', '[scattered applause]', 'We like to have fun. [audience chuckles] I’m proud to say that I’ve never once in my entire life paid money to have sex with a prostitute. And I’ll tell you this. They get so mad. [audience laughs] You know, there’s one thing I like about Milwaukee. [clicks tongue] And there is one thing I like about Milwaukee. [audience chuckles] Seems like a safe place to live. Yeah. Maybe not to you, but compared to where I live in Los Angeles, oh my God, this is paradise. My neighborhood’s really gone to shit in the past couple years. Gotten dangerous. The other day, a woman in my neighborhood was walking her dog, had the dog stolen from her at gunpoint. Now it’s my dog. [audience laughs] I actually do love it here in Milwaukee. I enjoy any time I get to come and perform. One of the all-time great stand-up comedy towns, Milwaukee. Yeah. It cheers me up to be back in Milwaukee. I’ll tell you that. I’ve needed cheering up lately too. I’ve been a little down lately. I’ll admit it. Lost a friend recently. Stupid. Friend of mine went to the hospital for an elective surgery. A simple breast reduction surgery. Did not survive the surgery. Died right there on the operating table. As far as I’m concerned.', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheers and applauds]', 'Yeah. Somehow that’s become one of the most polarizing jokes I’m gonna tell all night. And if you didn’t laugh at it, that’s okay. But what the fuck do you know? [audience chuckles] I’ve been doing this for 20 years. [woman cheers] And I’ll be honest, I had no idea it had been 20 years before my agent told me. I never thought of 20 years as a goal I should be trying to achieve. I’ve never defined success by longevity. I’ve always defined success by how long has it been since I had to have a roommate.', '[audience chuckles]', 'Yeah. It’s true. I haven’t had a roommate in 15 years. [woman cheers] I’m 45. That’s not a flex. [audience laughs] Last roommate I ever had… Last roommate I ever had, he had a video of every single person he’d ever had sex with in our apartment. Yeah. It’s a betrayal of trust. But it was hilarious. He had no idea. [audience laughs] Another way I define success as an artist. How long has it been since I had to have a day job? Again, 15 years. I hated the day jobs I had to have coming up. Imagine what I was like at a day job 15 years ago. [audience chuckles] I had this one day job. Someone kept stealing my lunch. Someone stole my lunch every single day, even though I clearly had my name written on it. And I was pretty sure I knew who did it. I just couldn’t prove it. So, one day before work, I crushed up an entire bottle of laxatives. Enough laxatives to cripple a man. And I put them in my food, and then I waited until this guy got up to go to the bathroom. And as soon as he did, I shit all over his desk.', '[audience laughs]', '[clicks tongue] Yeah, I got fired from most of my day jobs. All of them, really. All of them except the last one. Last day job I ever had, I worked in a giant, soulless corporate office building, and I quit in the middle of the day after I watched a 60-year-old woman accidentally step into an empty elevator shaft and plummet 30 stories to her death. I just walked right the fuck out. And that was my last day in elevator repair.', '[audience laughs]', 'If there’s one thing I’m getting sick of after 20 years of stand-up comedy, it’s the travel. I always say I do the shows for free. You pay me to travel. And that is certainly true tonight.', '[audience chuckles]', 'Two nights ago, I fly from New York City to Milwaukee. Two-and-a-half-hour flight. It’s direct. It should be easy. I get on the plane. The woman sitting next to me has a 100-pound dog curled up in her lap. And I say, “Excuse me, but what the fuck is this?” [audience laughs] This woman, I swear to God, she rolls her eyes at me, and she goes, “Uh, this is my emotional support animal.” “I have a note from my doctor.” I was like, “Note from your doctor?” “Do you really need an emotional support animal on this flight?” And she goes, “No.” And I thought my head was going to explode. I don’t like when people take advantage of the system like that. It’s a two-and-a-half-hour flight. I talked to her about it. I’m happy to report by the time we landed, she needed that fucking dog.', '[audience laughs]', 'Air travel has gotten so uncomfortable in the past few years. But everyone I know who flies a lot like I do, they always have a little trick. Everyone’s got their own unique trick to make flying easier for them. Like, I’m friends with a very wealthy married couple. They’re millionaires. And they got six kids in between the two of ’em. They’re always flying off on some exotic family vacation. And whenever they fly, their trick is the family flies on two separate airplanes. That way, worst-case scenario, one of those planes crashes, they don’t have to deal with their kids anymore.', '[audience laughs]', 'Uh-huh. But look, if I’m being honest with you guys… If I’m being honest, I don’t actually have any married friends. [audience chuckles] I used to. Used to have a lot of married friends. But all my married friends have gotten divorced in the past two years. All of them. But I’ve noticed something. All my friends’ divorces, they all had two things in common. Infidelity and me. [audience laughs] Hey, listen. [clicks tongue] All right, listen. You guys have been great so far. I hate to do this to you, but this next joke is gonna be too smart for the crowd. Don’t worry. I will explain it to you. And after all, aren’t those the best jokes? Sigmund Freud’s mom must’ve been so fucking hot.', '[audience laughs]', 'Okay? Get that? A lot of you were faking it for the cameras. Let me explain. Dr. Sigmund Freud. The most famous psychoanalyst of all time. His main theory, his main claim to fame, was the theory that every young man wanted to murder his own father and have sex with his own mother. Imagine. Imagine how hot his mom must have been for his colleagues to go, “Publish that.” [audience laughs] [clicks tongue] I was 14 years old when I walked in on my parents having sex. That’s a big moment for any young man. That moment when you realize your parents are more than just Mom and Dad. They’re also swingers. [audience laughs] Yeah, that was a core memory, for sure. Never forget that. I’ll never forget the night of my senior prom. Night of my senior prom. I’m 18 years old. I’m at home, putting on my tuxedo when my dad walked in the room, and he handed me a condom. Snuck it to me in a handshake. So fuckin’ gross.', '[audience chuckles]', 'Then he looks me right in the eyes, and he says, “Anthony, do you have any questions?” I said, “Yeah, Dad.” Do you have one that’s still in the wrapper? [audience laughs] Yeah, my dad was fuckin’ weird, okay? All your dads are weird. When you’re a kid, you can’t recognize how weird your parents are. It’s not until you get older that you figure it out. Like, when I was a little kid, every year on my birthday, my dad would take me into the kitchen, put me up against the kitchen wall and make a little mark to measure my girth.', '[audience laughs]', '[Anthony] Mm. And maybe that messed me up a little bit. I don’t know. I feel like I’m a pretty normal guy. Although I do get angry when people try to talk to me about sex. I was having lunch with a friend the other day. And he says, “Anthony, I’ve been havin’ trouble with premature ejaculation.” I said, “Oh, yeah?” “Why don’t you try talkin’ about baseball?” [audience chuckles] He said, “Anthony, don’t you mean thinking about baseball?” And I said, “I don’t give a fuck what you think about.” “Just don’t talk to me about your premature ejaculation.” [audience cheers] When I was growin’ up, I had a sibling rivalry with my little brother. Got out of hand, to be quite honest. One day, my little brother went into the backyard, took my dog’s collar off, and let it run away from home. So I poisoned his fish. [audience chuckles] I think I won that one. ‘Cause the next day, I went out, and I found my dog, put his collar back on, brought him back home. But my brother, he died from the salmon. [audience laughs] Yeah, it’s a banger. [audience chuckles] Last year, my parents lost all of their money in a Ponzi scheme. So, of course, they came to me. Their wealthy, successful son. And asked me why I did that.', '[audience laughs]', '[Anthony] Mm. Mm. Yeah. My family didn’t have a lot of money when I was growin’ up. My dad was a volunteer firefighter. Do you know what a volunteer firefighter is? It is exactly like a regular firefighter. Except your son does not respect you. [audience chuckles] My mom’s been having a hard time. She’s gettin’ paranoid in her old age. Can’t sleep at night ’cause she gets too scared. So every night, around bedtime, she calls me to complain on the phone for hours that she’s too afraid to fall asleep in her own home. So finally, after months of this, just to get her off my back, I bought her a gun. And now she’s scared about that. She said, “Anthony, what’s the matter with you?” “Don’t you know that people who live with a gun are more than twice as likely to be shot in their own home?” I said, “Mom, I am counting on it.” [audience laughs and groans] And look, maybe, maybe I’m being too harsh. I have trouble sleeping sometimes too. Like the other night. The other night, I’m lying in bed, and I cannot fall asleep. I’m just staring out my bedroom window for hours. And I swear, I saw my next-door neighbor murder his wife in their kitchen then dispose of the body in garbage bags. Now I’m worried I’m next. Like, I don’t think he saw me, but he sure as shit heard me clappin’.', '[audience laughs]', 'Now, here’s a joke I like a lot. My cousin Randy is maybe the dumbest person I’ve ever met in my entire life. Dumbest guy I’ve ever met. The other day, he comes up, and he goes, “Anthony, check out my new tattoo.” “It’s the Japanese symbol for awesome.” [clicks tongue] “No, Randy.” “That’s a swastika.” [audience laughs] “I mean, fuck, man. Everybody knows.” “Everybody knows that’s the German symbol for awesome.” [audience laughs and cheers] Now, I said I liked that joke a lot. Here’s how much I like that joke. I used to open with it. Right at the beginning of this tour, 18 months ago, Kanye West came to one of my shows. I had no idea he was even there. I didn’t find out until the next day when Kanye went on a podcast. And he said, “I went to go see Anthony Jeselnik last night, and his opening joke is so high level that it made me realize I’m not funny.” [audience chuckles] Guys, that blew my mind That’s the best compliment I’ve ever gotten in my life. I humbled Kanye West.', '[audience chuckles]', 'You know. Yeah. I’m not gonna lie. I was so excited. I watched that clip 100 times. I sent it to my manager. I said, “Put this on my website.” “Put it on social media.” “Let’s sell some fucking tickets… [audience chuckles] …with a little help from Kanye.” And my manager says to me, “Anthony, are you out of your goddamn mind?” “Don’t you know what’s been going on with Kanye lately?” And I said no. Honestly. I used to be a huge Kanye fan, but I stopped paying attention to him when he went Christian. [audience chuckles] And my manager says, “Well, in the past two weeks alone, Kanye’s been wearing White Lives Matter T-shirts and saying wild, anti-Semitic shit.” And I was like, “Oh.” [clicks tongue] “He went super Christian.”', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheers and applauds]', 'That crazy son of a bitch finally finished the whole book. [audience laughs] My manager said, “Look, Anthony, you can use this clip of Kanye to promote yourself if you want to, but if you do, you gotta drop that swastika joke.” “You gotta stop doing it for sure.” “Otherwise, you’re gonna start to attract the wrong kinds of fans, and your current fans will take the wrong lesson from what you’re doing.” And that’s how much I like that joke. [audience laughs] I’m against cancel culture. [audience cheers] Thank you. That’s my impression of a shit comic trying to get on Rogan. [audience cheers] In 20 years of stand-up comedy, I’ve been asked the same questions over and over and over again. The question I get asked the most by far is, “Anthony, what do you think about cancel culture?” “Does it make you mad?” “Aren’t you scared? What do you think about cancel culture?” So, let me be clear. I don’t give a fuck about cancel culture. What I am sick of are comedians complaining about cancel culture. It’s not that hard. Do your job. [audience laughs and cheers] Comedians are supposed to be unparalleled badasses. I know this because I have a fucking mirror.', '[audience laughs]', 'Cancel culture is not scary. It’s also not interesting. And it’s definitely not new. Back when I was in college, I had this crazy professor. Made all of his students fill out their own suicide note. Then he would read them out loud to the rest of the class. [audience chuckles] As soon as the parents found out, he got fired immediately. And I was the only one who stood up for him. Because, hey, he made math fun. [audience laughs] And yes, I did mention Joe Rogan, guys. Do not get me wrong. I like Joe. Joe’s my friend. Joe’s a good guy. But if you listen to his podcast, you’re a fucking loser. [audience laughs] My brother-in-law is Joe Rogan’s biggest fan. Never misses an episode. Doesn’t think four hours is long enough. But my brother-in-law is Joe Rogan’s target demographic. My brother-in-law is a conspiracy theorist. A crazy conspiracy theorist. Like, my brother-in-law refuses to become an organ donor because he swears that if you get into an accident and the paramedics see that you’re an organ donor, they won’t try to save your life ’cause they want to use your organs to help someone else. It’s insane, but I can’t argue with him. He’s a paramedic.', '[audience laughs]', \"Another question I’ve been asked a million times in the last 20 years, “Anthony, what’s your favorite joke you’ve ever written?” It’s easy. The first one. Twenty years ago, when I started this, I started from nothing. I was nothing. I was just going around to open mics in Los Angeles, performing for bitter open-mic comedians who never reacted to anything. I was just trying to find my voice. Could I be good at this? Could I make it a living? And it took a while. Until one night, I went to a coffee shop, tried this joke out for the first time. Changed my whole life. I said, “Guys, my girlfriend loves to eat chocolate.” “She’s always eating chocolate, and she likes to joke she’s got a chocolate addiction.” Hmm? “‘Keep me away from those chocolate bars. I’m addicted to ’em.'” “And it’s really annoying.” “So one day I put her in the car, and I drove her downtown, and I pointed out a crack addict, and I said, ‘Do you see that, honey?'” “‘Why can’t you be that skinny?'”\", '[audience laughs]', 'And I will never forget telling that joke for the very first time to a room full of bitter open-mic comedians who never reacted to anything. And the whole room just went, “Ooh.” [audience chuckles] I was like, “Oh, I’m gonna be a fucking star.” [audience laughs] And then, of course, a couple years later, I got my big break, and I got to do some roasting. Got to roast Donald Trump, Charlie Sheen, Roseanne Barr, all the greats. [audience cheers] People still ask me, “Anthony, which one was your favorite?” Charlie Sheen. But not because of Charlie Sheen. I didn’t give a fuck about Charlie Sheen. I remember a couple days before that roast, I’m at home writing jokes. And I get a phone call from the network. And they say, “Anthony, I know you only have a couple days left to write, but we just added Mike Tyson to the dais.” “Will you be able to write yourself any jokes about Mike Tyson?” [audience chuckles] Two days later, I am walking into that roast with 100 jokes about Mike Tyson. [audience laughs] I am so excited. And right as I go to sit down, guy from the network comes back. He goes, “I’m just double-checking with you.” “You don’t have any Mike Tyson rape jokes, do you?” [audience chuckles] And I said, “Why?” [audience laughs] And he said, “Well, it was almost impossible to get Mike Tyson to agree to appear on a televised roast.” “We had to promise him there would be no rape jokes.” I was like, “Are we talking about the same Mike Tyson?” [audience laughs] So now the roast has begun. I’m up at the podium. Cameras are rolling. I have zero jokes about Mike Tyson.', '[audience laughs]', 'And I am mad about it. But out of the corner of my eye, I can see Mike Tyson sitting on the stage. Mike’s been drinkin’. Mike’s been smokin’. Mike’s laughing at everything. Mike’s responding to jokes that aren’t even about him. Mike Tyson was having the time of his life. So I think, “You know what?” “I can do one.” [audience laughs] So I said, “I think Mike Tyson’s biggest problem is Mike never had a strong male role model growing up.” “Mike’s dad walked out on the family very early on after Mike raped him.”', '[audience laughs]', '[scattered applause]', 'Now, as soon as I tell this joke… As soon as I tell this joke, I regret it. [audience chuckles] I am afraid. And I turned to look at Mike Tyson to see, is he coming at me? Am I about to die? And I just see Mike Tyson throw his head back, and he goes, [laughs] “He got you, Charlie.” [audience laughs] Guys, in 20 years of stand-up comedy, I’ve gotten to meet so many famous people. Haven’t given a fuck about any of ’em. Except for one, and that was Norm Macdonald.', '[audience cheers]', 'Yeah. Yeah. All right. Long before I ever even considered becoming a comedian, I worshiped Norm Macdonald. He was my hero when I was a kid. He’s still my hero today. Never got to meet him for the longest time. Then a couple years ago, I get a phone call from my agent. He says, “Anthony, how would you like to be the new host of Last Comic Standing?” And I said, “Why the fuck would I want to do that?”', '[audience laughs]', '“That show sucks.” And he said, “This year, it’s gonna be different.” “This year, they have Norm Macdonald as a judge.” “Would you like to work with Norm?” And I signed up on the spot. Norm and I made eight episodes of this TV show together. Eight straight nights of eight-hour tapings every night. And for the first four episodes, Norm Macdonald and I do not get along at all. [audience chuckles] We get into fights every night on the air. We get into fights every night backstage. We flat-out do not like each other. And it’s killing me. He’s my hero and the only reason I took this job. So for those first four episodes, I am working at it, and I’m working at it hard. Norm’s working at it too, just not nearly as hard.', '[audience chuckles]', 'But after four episodes, for whatever reason, something clicks. Finally, Norm and I are laughing together. We’re getting along. All I ever wanted. After the show was finally finished, Norm and I had to go and promote it. And the last time I ever saw Norm Macdonald, we are backstage at Larry King. I’m getting interviewed first, and then Norm. Right before I go out, Norm says to me, “Hey, Anthony, I know we haven’t always gotten along or seen eye-to-eye, but if you’re up for it and you trust me, I thought of something really funny that you and I could do together.” I said, “Oh my God, Norm. Of course. You’re my hero.” “Tell me what you want to do.” He says, “I think it’ll be funny if instead of promoting the show by talking about these other comedians, why don’t you and I just promote the show by publicly insulting each other?” He says, “Don’t even try to be funny, Anthony.” “Just be mean.” [audience chuckles] And I said, “You know what, Norm? I can do that.”', '[audience laughs]', 'I sit down with Larry King. Larry says, “Anthony, what you think about Norm Macdonald?” And I said, “Larry, Norm Macdonald is a piece of shit.” [audience chuckles] And I can hear Norm laughing backstage. I finish the interview. I go backstage. Norm is still laughin’. He says, “Anthony, that was perfect.” “Now, watch this.” [audience chuckles] Norm sits down with Larry King. Larry King says, “Norm, what do you think about Anthony Jeselnik?” Norm says, “Larry, he’s one of the greats.”', '[audience laughs]', '[audience applauds and cheers]', 'I’ve never been more pissed off in my entire life. [audience chuckles] Can’t believe I fell for that. You have been an amazing crowd today. I’m going to leave you all with this. This is my new closer. Don’t worry. It is trans-proof. [audience chuckles] About a month ago, I went to a wedding. Craziest wedding I’ve ever seen. After the ceremony, every single person there took Molly. The bride took Molly. The groom took Molly. The parents, the grandparents. Every single person there was on Molly. Craziest shit I’ve ever seen. I blacked out around midnight. Woke up the next morning in a fucking hammock somewhere. Went and found the bride and groom, and I was like, “Hey, guys.” “Did I do anything embarrassing last night?” And they said, “Yeah, Anthony.” “You spiked the punch with Molly.”', '[audience laughs]', 'Thank you very much, Milwaukee. Have a great night. Thank you.', '[audience cheering and applauding]', '[indistinct, excited chatter]', '[chatter fades]'], ['Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval is less a comedy special and more an hour-long ego massage for the embattled host. What should have been a triumphant farewell instead feels like a poorly executed PR stunt, filled with tired, drawn-out jokes and forced self-deprecation. Ellen spends much of the special rehashing controversies surrounding her toxic workplace allegations, but instead of addressing them meaningfully, she spins these moments into awkward jokes, coming across as defensive rather than introspective.', 'The comedy itself is uninspired and stale, with tired observations about things like car troubles, pigeons, and aging that feel recycled from better comics. The pacing is atrocious, dragging on for what feels like an eternity, with Ellen stretching out weak material well beyond its comedic lifespan. Her attempts to balance humor with personal reflection fall flat, making it seem more like she’s fishing for sympathy rather than offering genuine entertainment.', 'What’s most striking is the clear disconnect between Ellen and her audience. The packed crowd of adoring fans seems willing to laugh at anything she says, but the comedy is hollow, with Ellen relying on her celebrity status rather than delivering anything truly funny or meaningful. It’s painfully obvious that this special exists not because she has anything new to say, but because she needs to reclaim some positive attention after her tarnished reputation.', 'For Your Approval is a disappointing, self-serving finale that highlights how out of touch Ellen has become. For anyone hoping for a strong farewell from a comedy icon, this special is a huge letdown.

All it takes is trying to parallel park in front of a crowded outdoor café.', '[audience laughs] Spot looks big enough.', '[audience laughs] You line it up the way you always do. You pull in, cut it a little too close. You’re scraping the hubcap the entire way along the curb. Making a very loud noise. Put it in drive, pull out. Try it again. Now you’ve overcompensated. You’re sticking so far out, you’re blocking traffic in that lane. Now you have a decision to make. Do you have the confidence to pull out and do it right this time? Or do you do that back-and-forth, back-and-forth, back-and-forth… inching your way to the curb?

I couldn’t make it.”', '[audience laughs] And they’re like, “You did. I was sitting there, I was watching you.”', '[audience laughs] “I started the chant.”', '[audience laughs]', '[Ellen giggles] It’s funny how we can be embarrassed all by ourselves in a car. All by ourselves, for anything, just any stupid reason. Like, even if we just can’t figure out how to turn our windshield wipers off. Which, to me, is one of the most embarrassing things, is driving a car when it’s not raining and the windshield wipers are going. And it’s because someone decided to add a random one. We had… The windshield wiper situation was fine. We had the fast mode for when it’s raining heavily, medium, light. And then someone decided we’re just gonna wash away the rain once in a while.', '[audience laughs] We don’t need to see all the time. And it’s always a surprise ’cause you think the rain has stopped, you’ve turned it off and you’re driving along, and five minutes later, you see this thing, like… Then you’re trying to fiddle with it, trying to turn it off, and you don’t know how ’cause it’s always different. Sometimes it’s on the end of the lever on the steering wheel. Sometimes there’s a lever within the lever, the baby lever. Like the lever had a baby and it’s inside the lever right there. Tiny baby lever. You don’t trust it ’cause you’re just waiting… Even if it’s not going, you’re like, “It’s gonna go again. I know it. I feel it.” And then finally, it does, and then you feel pretty confident about it. Then you catch the rearview mirror, your back one’s been on the whole time.', '[audience laughs] Yeah.', '[audience cheering] That’s what you did. You turned that one on. You turn that off, turn everything back on again. You have to sell your car.', '[audience laughs] There’s so many extraneous things in a car we don’t need. For instance, I have never used my parking brake. I’ve never parked my car and thought, “I want it more parked than this.”', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheering] There are things you need, the seat adjustments. Scoot forward. Lean back. You need those. Then there’s that one button that inflates the back of the seat, the one that makes you feel like you’re getting spooned by a pregnant woman.', '[audience laughs]', '“Oh boy.” “Ooh!” “All right.” Apparently, it’s for lumbar support. Got to support your lumbar. You got to. It’s all any of us knows about the lumbar. It’s got to be supported.', '[audience laughs]', 'You don’t get support for your lumbar any place other than your car.', '[audience laughs]', 'You don’t even hear about the lumbar anyplace else.', '[audience laughs]', '“Bill, what’s wrong? What’s happening?” “It’s my damn lumbar.”', '[audience laughs]', '“I haven’t been driving enough lately.”', '[audience laughs]', 'Mm. [chuckling]', 'That’s how you walk when your lumbar is out. There are buttons in my car I’ve never used, never will use. There’s a button with squiggly lines next to a misshapen peanut. I don’t know.', '[audience laughs]', 'I’ve never touched it. I’m fine. There’s a button with tally marks next to a sideways yarmulke. What the hell?', '[audience laughs]', 'Don’t get me started on the dashboard lights too.

We’re all interested in different things, all good at different things. I was talking to someone and they said, “I don’t know how you get on stage. I could never do that.” I said, “Well, I don’t know how you dry-clean clothes.”', '[audience laughs]', 'Clean clothes dryly. And then you Martinize on top of that. Some of you are in your twenties.

None of us do. Let me catch you up on what’s been going on with me since you saw me last.', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheering] I got chickens.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah.', '[cheering] Thank you. I love them so very much. Chickens are the best bird to have at home, I think so. A lot of people think parrots, but they’re so gossipy.', '[audience laughs]', 'You have to be really careful what you say around them. Chickens will never talk. They have little personalities. I’ve always wanted chickens. Now I have them, they’re so cute. They see me. They recognize me when I walk towards them, and they run to me. I put a swing in there for them, and they get on a swing. Chicken on a swing. That’s ridiculous.', '[audience laughs]', 'I have a bench in there and I go sit there, and they sit on my lap, and I pet them and they fall asleep, and they give me an egg every day. They lay an egg every day. As someone who hosted a daily talk show, I can really appreciate that.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', '[audience cheering]', 'I’m sure they’re thinking, “I just laid an egg.” I don’t think I can do that again tomorrow.” And yet, they do. They’re curious little animals too. They’re very curious. Hey, you know how people always ask, “Why did the chicken cross the road?” I think I know, now that I have chickens. It’s their innate sense of adventure.', '[audience laughs] [chortles]', '[audience laughs]', 'I’m sorry to be just another comedian going on and on about her chickens.', '[audience laughs]', 'Another thing about chickens is that, um…', '[audience laughs]', '…they… they fly. People think they’re flightless birds, and that is not true. They do fly. The longest recorded chicken flight is 13 seconds. Isn’t that amazing? Someone thought to time that.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah. Also, chickens dream. Scientists have discovered that chickens dream. Now listen, I love animals more than anyone, but we could take scientists working on chicken dreams and move them on over to climate change.', '[audience laughing and cheering]', 'I’m not saying that chicken dreaming is not worth studying, it is. But we don’t need our top minds on it, I don’t think. I am curious. What do they dream about? Probably the same things we do. Probably flying. But 14 or 15 seconds for them, you know. Mm. That’s all for chickens.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah. Got to save some for the memoir.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah. Yeah.', 'Yeah.', '[cheering and applause]', 'Yeah. Let me see what else I can tell you about that has been going on. Chickens…', '[audience laughs]', '[audience laughs]', 'Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah. Yeah.', '[audience cheering]', 'Thanks. Yeah, ’cause I’m mean. Yeah. You can’t be mean and be in show business. No, they’ll kick you out. No mean people in show business. I’m out. Yeah, y’all heard I was mean. Everybody heard that I was mean. Everywhere I go, I know everyone’s heard that I’m mean. I know when I walk into a restaurant, people are watching, waiting to see if I’ll be mean.', '[audience laughs]', '[applause]', '“Do you think she’ll be mean first and then dance?”', '[audience laughs]', '“Look, she… Oh, she’s reaching for butter.”', '[audience laughs]', '“I thought she was gonna hit somebody.” “All right, I’m gonna eat. You watch now.” [inhales] That was a big story, huh? That had some legs on it. The first I heard about it, I… I came across a headline that said, “How Ellen DeGeneres became the most hated person in America.” Now, I didn’t see the other names on the ballot, but I have to…', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheering loudly]', 'Yeah. It’s… It’s an impressive title, it really is. It’s a… It’s a horrible thing to say about somebody, and to make it worse, there was no trophy, no awards banquet, nothing. Just the title, just, you know… I made a sash at home and I wore that around, just to… to feel like I had something, you know? It was quite a shock to me because for 17 years, there were all these polls basically saying I was one of the most trusted people in the country. There was a poll that asked people, “Which celebrity would you most want to babysit your child?” And I was the number one answer.', '[applause]', '[audience cheering]', 'Because when you think “good with kids,” you immediately think childless, lesbian stand-up comedian.', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheering]', 'Once they heard that I might be mean, they didn’t want me to babysit anymore. So it wasn’t all bad. [chuckles] No. I was in therapy for a while trying to deal with all the hatred coming at me, and it was not a common situation for a therapist to deal with. My therapist said, “Ellen, where do you get this idea that everyone hates you?” And I said, “Well, um, New York Times, Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly, Us Weekly.” “I think Elmo may have said something recently on an episode of Sesame Street.” She said, “You just need to avoid looking at the news, just avoid media.” And I was like, “I am. I’m not looking at anything.” I would know when something was going on because I’d start getting text from friends saying, “Thinking of you,” or, “Sending love.” And I’d be like, “Oh.” “Why do I need love sent?” “The ‘be kind’ girl wasn’t kind.” That was the headline. Here’s the problem. I’m a comedian who got a talk show, and I ended the show every day by saying, “Be kind to one another.”', '[audience cheering]', 'Yeah. I know. It seemed like a good idea. But I became a brand, a one-dimensional character who gave stuff away and danced every day up steps. Do you know how hard it was to dance up steps? Would a mean person dance up steps? I don’t think so. Had I ended my show by saying, “Go fuck yourselves…”', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheering]', '…people would have been pleasantly surprised to find out I’m kind.', '[audience laughs]', 'I loved that show. I loved everything about that show. It was a family to me. Here’s something sweet. Sixteen people who worked there started out straight, and by the time they left, were gay.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah. You don’t see Jimmy Kimmel doing those kind of numbers.', '[audience laughs]', 'You know what’s funny, is that when I first came out, people were afraid that watching my show would turn people gay. Which is ridiculous. You have to work there. You have to fill out a W-2. And then, you turn gay. We had so much fun together at that show. We laughed all the time. We played games all the time. I started a game of tag in, like, 2016 that we played all the way till when the show ended ’cause I just loved playing games. We played tag, and I would chase people down the hallways, I would chase them around the studio and scare them all the time. I would jump out, scare people ’cause I would love to do that, and… Hearing myself say this out loud, I… realize I was chasing my employees and terrorizing them. I can see where that would be misinterpreted. Well… We had morning meetings every morning in my office. The producers would come in, writers would come in, and we’d talk about what we were gonna do on the show that day. And Andy Lassner was one of my executive producers.', '[audience cheering]', 'Yeah. Uh, Andy is a very nervous man, and he… Everything scares him. He could drop his pen and it would startle him. He’s just a nervous man. And Alison was one of my writers who was scared of snakes. Anything snake-related. So, sometimes, before they’d come into my office, we would hide rubber snakes in a panel in the ceiling, and I had a button that I could push that would release the snakes down…', '[audience exclaims]', 'Again, hearing myself say this out loud… But they liked it. [chuckles] They did. There are a lot of perks with having your own television show. Number one has to be the ability to say to someone, “We should have a panel in the ceiling that releases snakes.”', '[audience laughs]', 'And then another adult says, “Yeah, we’ll get that started right away.” Scaring was just a big component of the show. We would… You know, we started with scaring guests, and I don’t remember exactly how it started. It was some simple, like… I think Chris Hemsworth, or some big strong guy that was on the show, we found out was scared of crickets. So we had someone dress as a cricket and sneak up behind his chair when he was talking, and… [roars] …you know, make a cricket noise and scare him. And then it just escalated. We just decided to make it more surprising to people, and, eventually, we, uh, built a table that looked like the table between me and the guest, but it was actually a box where someone could pop out and scare them. But the guests got wise to that, and if they saw that it was a box, they would open it and look in the box. So we built a tunnel under the stage that went into the box… so that when they checked it, it was empty, and then they’d close it, and somebody would crawl into the box from underneath. I was a very immature boss.', '[audience laughs] I didn’t want to be a boss. I didn’t go to business school. I went to Charlie’s Chuckle Hut. It looked like I was the boss. The show is called Ellen, and everybody’s wearing T-shirts that say Ellen, and there were buildings all over the Warner Bros. lot that said Ellen. But I don’t think that meant that I should be in charge. I don’t think that Ronald McDonald’s the CEO of McDonald’s. [applause]', '[audience cheering] Everything I knew about being a boss, I learned from movies. And those were things like saying, “Jenkins, my office, now!” Or, “The name’s Frank, how the hell are you?” But those were men bosses. Women bosses didn’t come along for a while, not till around the time of Martinizing, I think.', '[audience laughs]', 'No. But men bosses and women bosses are different. Like, a woman boss couldn’t say, “Jenkins, my office, now.” A woman boss would have to use more words. A woman boss would have to say something like, “Excuse me, Jenkins. I don’t want to bother you.” “If you’re not too busy, could you step into my office real quick?” “I just have to talk to you for a second. Thank you so much.”', '[audience cheering]', '‘Cause women are raised in a different way. At least I was. I was raised to be a people pleaser. I was taught, when I was a little girl, to be small and quiet and agreeable. And it’s crazy what I’ve done with my life, ’cause I’m exactly the opposite of how I was raised to be.', '[audience cheering]', 'Yeah. Most women aren’t raised with confidence. We just aren’t. We’re too self-conscious, which is why you rarely see a woman playing air guitar.', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheering]', 'I love how they make it like it’s hard. Like something’s happening there. Men can get away with acting out things that aren’t actually happening and not look crazy, somehow. A man, in the middle of nowhere, and for no reason, can practice an imaginary golf swing. Just…', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheering]', '“Oh, no, I’m not in line.” “I’m just waiting for my latte. You go ahead.” [chuckles] Men’ll jump up and see if they can slap the top of a doorframe.', '[audience laughs]', 'I’ve never had that urge. “I wonder if I could hit that?” “Tiffany, hold my purse. I’m gonna give it a try.”', '[audience cheering]', '[groans] “I couldn’t do it! I didn’t. Give me my purse. I didn’t do it.” Good. We have all these unwritten rules based on gender, of acceptable behavior, of who we’re allowed to be and how we’re allowed to act. If we don’t follow those rules, it makes people uncomfortable. When people get uncomfortable, there are consequences. For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business. [audience laughs and cheers] Yeah. Kicked me out before ’cause I told them I was gay. No gay people in show business.', '[audience laughs]', 'No. They’ll kick you out. Can’t be gay and be in show business. Eventually, they’re gonna kick me out a third time for being old. Mean, old, and gay. The triple crown.', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheering]', 'I knew it was a risk to tell people I was gay ’cause I knew a lot of people didn’t like gay people. If they did, we wouldn’t have needed the parade. Listen, we don’t like all of you either, but we don’t make a big thing about it.', '[audience cheering]', 'Most of us get into this business because we didn’t get enough love or attention as a child. So we go into a business that depends on people liking us to be successful. What’s wrong with us? [chuckles] For me, it was never about the money. It was about healing my childhood wounds. I thought if I could make people happy, then they’ll like me. And if they like me, I’ll feel good about myself. And all I can say about that is, “Thank God for the money.”', '[audience laughs]', '‘Cause it’s a fickle business. They liked me for a long time. I was on a sitcom, I made them laugh. They liked me, then I told them I was gay, and they didn’t like me. Then I got a talk show, and I gave them TVs and cars, and I danced, and they liked me. Then they heard a rumor I was mean, they didn’t like me. So it’s been a real test for my ego and my self-esteem because there’s such extremes in this business. There are people who love you and idolize you, and then there are people who hate you, just really loudly hate you. So, sometimes, I long for my childhood, when I just had good old-fashioned neglect.', '[audience laughs]', 'What was wrong with that? [chuckles] It’s been two years since the show ended and it’s been an adjustment, because for 19 years, I drove onto the Warner Bros. lot, passed a giant billboard of my face. So the first thing I did was I had a giant billboard of my face installed on my lawn, so I saw that when I drove in. Yeah, then I put an “applause” sign in the dining room, and that’s helping also. But, really, I’ve only known myself working for 40 years. That’s all I’ve done, is work. So I didn’t really have a lot of free time and didn’t have hobbies. Now there’s a lot of free time, so I’m trying to figure out what to do with that. So I got the chickens, remember? I don’t know if you… Yeah. I decided to take up gardening ’cause everybody talks about gardening and how great gardening is. It’s not.', '[audience laughs]', 'No. It’s really not. I got the overalls and the tool belt and the hat. I looked adorable. I did. But I find once you put the plants in the ground, you’re no longer gardening. You’re just waiting, you know? I tell people I grew these strawberries, but at best I was just there when it happened. It’s the sun and the sprinklers that should take the credit. I’m more like the strawberries’ godmother showing up on its birthday. “Look how big you’re getting.”', '[audience laughs]', '“See you at Christmas, maybe.” It is relaxing to be out there, though. Mainly ’cause the garden gloves make it impossible for me to look at my phone. Yeah. Sometimes, I’ll put the garden gloves on and go inside and lay down. Yeah. It’s just as relaxing, really. My garden gloves and my sweatpants… I live in sw… When I’m at home, I just wear sweatpants. I don’t understand people who don’t just wear sweatpants at home. Like, what’s the point, you know?', '[audience cheering]', 'Yeah. I take off my going-out clothes. I take those off, put on my staying-home clothes. Once I’m in my sweatpants, I’m not leaving. Not leaving the house. A few weeks ago, a friend of mine texted me, and he said, “Would you like to come over for a last-minute dinner party for Mick?” As in Jagger. [audience exclaims] Now, I’ve never met Mick Jagger, and I would love to meet Mick Jagger, but I was in my sweatpants already, and I was not leaving.', '[audience cheering]', 'That’s what I told him, and he could not believe that was the reason I wasn’t going. I guess most people would make something up because it is a ridiculous reason, and I know that, but it was the truth. You know? And, you know, people say honesty is the best policy. I don’t know why they say that. It’s only the best policy if it’s something you want to hear, really. Like, there are certain degrees of honesty. If you tell someone there’s something stuck in their teeth, they don’t love that, but they kind of appreciate that and they’ll take that. But as soon as you tell someone that all of their stories should be 50% shorter…', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah.', '[audience cheering]', '…you lose 100% of their friendship, is what happens. People say it’s hard to tell the truth. For me, it’s hard not to tell the truth. Which is why it was really difficult for me to keep my sexuality a secret, because I felt such guilt for not being honest about who I was. I felt shame for how society was making me feel. I felt fear for what would happen to my career if I did come out. Ultimately, I decided it’s more important for me to be honest about who I am.', '[audience cheering]', 'Yeah. Yeah. They say, “The truth will set you free,” and it did. I was free for three years.', '[audience laughs]', 'Nobody would hire me. Truth will make you broke. People lie so much these days, they really do. You can tell, because they make such a big deal of it when they’re telling the truth. They’ll say things like, “Well, to tell you the truth…” or, “If I’m being honest…” If you’re being honest? I prefer it the other way around. “Listen, I’m gonna lie to you here.”', '[audience laughs]', '“That lasagna was phenomenal.”', '[audience laughs] Most people tell me that they appreciate my honesty because they know where they stand with me, but someone did suggest that I get tested to see if I’m on the spectrum. And, uh, I’m not on the spectrum. And I wouldn’t care if I was on the spectrum, but I’m not. Well, I am on the spectrum.', '[audience laughs]', 'We all are. It’s a spectrum.', '[audience laughing and cheering]', 'I’m on the part of the spectrum where someone on the spectrum would have a problem with me saying I’m on the spectrum, so… Yeah, that’s right. But I may have OCD because a therapist said so. And I said, “Yes, I am very organized,” because I thought that was the “O.”', '[audience laughs]', 'I didn’t know what OCD was. I was raised in a religion, Christian Science, that doesn’t acknowledge diseases or disorders. So, when I was growing up, nobody talked about anything. There was no discussion of anything. I look back now, and I realize my dad for sure had OCD. He would check the doorknob 15 times before we would leave. He would check the faucet 15 times. He would unplug all the appliances before we left the house because lightning could strike, and it would catch fire. They say it could be hereditary. So I went home and I asked Portia, I said, “Do you think I may have OCD?” And she said, “Yes, you do.”', '[audience laughs]', 'Barely got that sentence out, really. It’s funny, I’ve never thought of myself as obsessive. I think of myself as careful, and everyone else careless and out of control.', '[audience laughs]', 'I asked her what I obsess about, and she said, “You obsess about time.” And that is true. I don’t like to be late. I like to be on time. So, sometimes, that makes us early. This is the example she said I should share with you. I, um… There are many, but this is the one she said. Usher was having an after-party for the Grammys one year, and we got there so early, it was just us and the staff.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yup. Yup. We helped place candles on tables.', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheering]', '[chuckles] I invoiced him $200. These are my confessions. I just don’t know why the invitation says a certain time for a party to start, and then everyone goes an hour or two later. People seem to think that 6:00 means 7:00, 7:00 means 8:00, 8:00 means 9:00. 9:00 means nothing to me, ’cause I’m not going.', '[audience laughs]', '9:00. Who starts something at 9:00? Anyway, I obsess on time, and, uh, I obsess on animals. I know I obsess on animals ’cause I love them too much. Like, way too much. I think about how they see things and what they feel and what they think. And I worry about butterflies in rainstorms, and how delicate they are, and how their little tiny feet are holding on to a blade of grass, trying to… Winds blowing… The rain is happening on their little tiny wings… Saturating their wings, and their feet holding… Especially if it’s a butterfly. What if it’s his first day, and they’re, like, “Is this life? This is horrible.” Ooh… [chuckling] “I should have stayed a caterpillar.”', '[audience laughs]', '[chuckling] The monarch butterfly, think about that. How crazy is that story? You know the story. I don’t have to tell you. But I will. The little tiny caterpillar…', '[audience laughs]', 'I mean, how does it even make it past the caterpillar stage? It’s a larva, and then that somehow gets into a caterpillar. And a caterpillar just… And somehow, it just knows instinctively it’s time for that part of its life to change. “That’s done. I’m gonna put myself into a chrysalis.” And then it turns into liquid somehow. And then it becomes a butterfly flying for the first time. And it looks drunk and confused, the way they, you know…', '[audience laughs]', 'And they make it to Mexico that way. I don’t know how.', '[audience cheering]', 'The butterfly is beautiful, and people talk about the butterfly, but the butterfly wouldn’t be the butterfly without the caterpillar. I mean, the deep knowing that that caterpillar has. Its only perspective is crawling on the ground and it’s looking at other crawling things saying, “I’m gonna fly someday.” “And I’m gonna go to Mexico.” And they’re like, “No, you’re not.” “And what’s Mexico?” But I don’t know if we really fully appreciate what that metamorphosis is. The fact that it’s a caterpillar, it knows to change and becomes this other thing entirely. That’s genius. It’s brilliance. And the octopus, the octopus being able to change texture and shape and form and color instantaneously, depending on what it’s on. That’s genius. A colony of ants or of bees, the way they communicate, and there’s no chaos between all of those things. Everything in nature is living up to its full potential. But I am so disappointed in pigeons.', '[audience laughs]', 'What happened to them? I mean, pigeons, they have built-in GPS in their beaks. And they can fly for hundreds of miles. In World War II, they saved lives. They were taking messages from generals to other generals and saving lives. There are pictures of them in the newspaper with medals, not pinned, but around their necks, that they received for what they did in World War II, and now look at them. Just pecking at old gum in filthy alleyways and parking lots. They could be anywhere. I would feel sorry for them, but they made a choice.', '[audience laughs]', 'I mean, they barely fly anymore. They… They’re just, uh, filthy. And even if a car is coming, they don’t even fly to get out of the way. “All right. Okay, all right. Okay!” “All right. Okay, okay, all right. Okay!” [applause]', '[audience cheering]', 'Sometimes, it looks like they’re gonna do something important. You’ll see a bunch, and they all get up at once. Again, that kind of communication. All of them get up at once, they fly, and they just go in one big circle, and they go right back to where they were. God, you guys. Not living up to their potential. I rescued a pigeon one time. I’ll rescue anything. I’ve always tried to save animals my whole life. But I saw a one-legged pigeon on the street near where I lived, and I took it home because I knew it wasn’t gonna make it on the street and I didn’t know how to take care of it. I mean, never had a pigeon, so I just threw gum and trash down…', '[audience laughs] …dirt, thinking that’s what it eats. You know, because I’ve never seen it… It didn’t make it. I’ll rescue anything. I really will. And if I see a sign of someone posting a cat or a dog missing, when they post those pictures, I will drive around and I will try to find that animal. And it’s not just for the reward money.', '[audience laughs]', 'It’s not. No. I rescued a dog one time. I was driving, and I see this dog all by itself, and I get out of the car, and it’s soaking wet. I’m like, “Oh my God, what happened to you?” Take it home, dry it off, stays with me for the night. Put out posters the next afternoon. Get a call from the people saying, “Thank God. Where did you find it?” And I told them, and they said, “That’s where we live.”', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah. They said, “We had just given it a bath, and we put her on the lawn to dry out.” It was pretty close to the sidewalk when I saw it. [chuckles] Anyway, I obsess on things. I have ADD, and I blame the talk show for that because for 19 years, I was talking to people in five-minute segments. When I’m at a party and someone’s talking to me longer than five minutes, I have the urge to say, “I’m sorry, we have to take a break.”', '[audience laughs]', '[audience cheering]', 'Parties are hard for me. Parties are very hard for me. People are wanting to talk and stuff, and… [inhales] They always talk about books they’re reading. I don’t read. I want to. I try to read, but my ADD makes it really hard for me. As much as I try to focus on the words, I end up thinking about a sandwich I had earlier that day. Moby Dick, for me, is two pages about a whale and 425 pages about me wondering if I should grow my hair out or keep it short.', '[audience laughs]', 'I’ve had it short for a while. I should try to grow it out, probably. Maybe to my shoulder-length or something like that. Not much longer than that. I wonder how long that would take, though? I should probably keep it short, I think. That’s better. Why not try something different, though? I should. Oh, yeah. Oh, it’s done. Yeah.', '[audience cheering]', 'Yeah, my ADD makes it really hard for me to sit down and focus on anything at all. Like, do you know how hard it was for me to put this together? Of course you don’t. Why would I ask that question? Why do people ask people questions they know they don’t have the answer to? Why do people say, “Guess what I did yesterday?” Do I have to? Is it a game? Is there a prize? I don’t want to. “You’ll never guess what I did yesterday.” You’re right, I won’t. I won’t. Probably not. Unless it’s something really average, like you had lunch. You said I’ll never guess, so it’s probably something weird, like you got a chinchilla and named it “Stewart.” I don’t know. So it’s hard for me to focus, and I get, like… When I was thinking about pigeons and how disappointed I was in them, I was… I remembered that I had rescued the pigeon ’cause I’d forgotten. I was like, “Yeah, I rescued that one-legged pigeon.” And when I wrote down “legged,” I did the hyphen thing, and I thought, “leg-ged” or “legged”? Is it “legged”? “One-leg-ged”? “One-legged” pigeon or “one-leg-ged”? It’s not “one arm-med.” You don’t “one arm-med.” Armed. But it’s two Gs, so “leg-ged”? You don’t go, “I beg-ged for food.” No. You don’t stay, “I got mug-ged.” It’s “leg-ged.” Or “legged.” “One-leg pigeon.” “One-legged”? “One-leg-ged.” “One-leg pigeon.” “One-leg-ged.” “One-leg pigeon”? “One-leg-ged pigeon.” A one-leg… “One-leg-ged.” “One-leg pigeon.” “One-leg-ged” pigeon.', '[audience cheering]', 'So, I have ADD. I have OCD. I’m losing my memory. But I think I’m well-adjusted because I obsess on things but don’t have the attention span to stick with it, then I forget what I was obsessing about in the first place. So it takes me all the way around to being well-adjusted, I think. Yeah. [applause] [chuckles] I’m very impatient. That is a problem for me. I’m very impatient. It’s hard for me to live in the moment. We’re supposed to live in the moment. But every moment… Eh… The spiritual teacher Ram Dass wrote a book called Be Here Now. I’d like to write one for people with ADD and call it, Yeah, but What’s That over There?', '[audience laughs]', 'There are all these books out there telling us how to live, telling us why we’re here. ‘Cause why are we here, really? I mean, obviously, to gossip and make fun of each other on the internet, but why else? These things I think about now that I’m older. I’m 66 years old, and I…', '[audience cheering]', 'Thank you. That’s how you know you’re old, you get the applause.', '[audience laughs]', 'You don’t get it when you’re 30, or even in your 50s. It starts around 60. So I don’t like the word “old.” I think it’s a bad word. It just sounds bad. “Old.” “Is that bread still good?” “No, that’s old.” “Old.” And I don’t feel old. The only time I feel old is when I’m in a restaurant trying to read a menu. That is the only time I feel old. Yeah. [applause] You know all the reasons. It’s like, too dark in there. It’s always too dark. And the way they think they’re gonna help, they put a tealight candle on the table. Which does nothing. I blow it out. I just blow it out and, “Oh, okay.” You’re gonna light it again? All right, I’m just gonna… Because it doesn’t do anything. That’s why. Why are you lighting… Okay, I’ll do it again. I’m just gonna put it in my pocket. How about that? You can’t see. And if you put your flashlight on your phone to try to read the menu, that just automatically says, “Old.” That’s just… That’s… They should come with a sound effect. When you put the flashlight on… “Old!” It should just be “Old!” And even if you can see, the print is so small. I don’t know who is printing these menus, but the print is so tiny. It’s like they’re using a jeweler’s loupe to make the font. It’s tiny, tiny font. You can’t read it. I’m like, “Can you see that?” “Does that say ‘tortilla’ or ‘trampoline?’ What does that say to you?” “I can’t see anything. Yeah.” “Hi. Okay, I’ll go ahead and order. “I’m gonna get the pasta with stem cells.”', '[audience laughs]', 'They have a children’s menu. They should have a larger-print menu for older people with a bendy light so you can see it.', '[audience cheering]', 'Or, even better, they should come out in audiobook. A menu could be an audio… Meryl Streep reads The Cheesecake Factory. “Pancakes.” [chuckling] [chuckling] I don’t do impressions, that’s… “Pancakes.” When you’re this age, the doctors start asking you to come in for checkups. Even though there’s nothing wrong with you, they just want to see you. It’s a scam. They’re just looking for stuff. They ask you all kinds of personal stuff. “How many drinks per week do you have?” First of all, it’s none of your business.', '[audience cheering]', 'Second of all, I’m gonna lie to you here. Three.', '[audience laughs]', '“Drinks per week.” How about I start with “per day” before I do that math, okay? “Carry the two.” They just look for stuff. My doctor said, “When’s the last time you had a bone density test?” And I said, “A what?” “Bone density test.” I said, “I’ve never had a bone density test.” “Well, at your age, you should get one.” I said, “Why? I’m in good shape.” “No, you should get one at your age.” So I got the stupid bone density test. I’m off the charts. Below it. I have full-on osteoporosis. I don’t even know how I’m standing up right now.', '[audience laughs]', 'I’m like a human sandcastle. I could disintegrate in the shower. I have to take that Prolia shot every six months. Remember the commercial where the woman’s walking and a kid darts out on the skateboard or something… “Whoa!” “Whoa!” That’s me. It’s hard to be honest about aging and seem cool. Hey, if you got arthritis in your knee, make some noise!', '[audience cheering]', 'Oh! Me, too. I just had excruciating pain one day, and I thought I tore a ligament or something. I got the MRI, and they’re, like, “No, it’s just arthritis.” I said, “How’d I get that?” He goes, “It just happens at your age.” All these things just happen at your age. It’s around the time you start watching Wheel of Fortune.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah. There’s no buildup, you just find yourself sitting there enjoying it one day. “That’s a pretty gown Vanna’s wearing.” The prizes are tricky on there, I find. I think they really are. I had a 20-minute conversation about this the other day. If you land on the dollar amount, the $300, or the $1,500, you get that, right? But if you land on the car. Honk, honk! Half a car, by the way. You’re trying to land on the million dollars, that’s what you want. But the million dollars is sandwiched in between two bankrupts. If you freeze-frame it, you’ll notice that the bankrupts are a little bit larger than the sliver of the million dollars. You’ll see when you freeze-frame it, it’s just… When you land on it, you’re like, “I got a million dollars!” But no, you don’t. You have to have so many other things that line up to get that, which I was telling myself when Portia walked in and said, “Who are you talking to?”', '[audience laughs]', '[applause]', '[chuckles] Another thing that happens when you age, you just start talking to yourself. I’d probably be doing this exact same thing right now if you weren’t here.', '[audience laughs]', 'Aging is very interesting. Aging is tough on its own, but aging… Then you have aging parents, which a lot of people are dealing with now, which is really, really tough. My father is no longer with us. Well, he was never with you, um…', '[audience laughs]', '[chuckles] My mother has dementia now, and, um… which is a horrible disease. And so many people are dealing with it right now. My mother is lucky in the sense that she doesn’t know she has it. So she’s actually happy. She’s really happy. She’s in a really nice place. I have her in, uh… a facility that… They have a lot of activities to keep them stimulated. There’s painting, and arts and crafts, and bus rides, and different things that happen, um… I don’t know whose idea this was, but someone booked a magician.', '[audience laughs]', 'He… [chuckles] He was so excited to be there. He was wearing a tuxedo that fit him at one point in his life, and… he’s sitting, and he’s got a table. Thirteen women in different stages of dementia, and… “Pick a card.”', '[audience laughs]', 'Eh? “I can’t see it. What is it?” “It’s a queen of hearts.” “No, don’t tell her. I want you to look at it, and just…” “You just look at that and remember it, okay.” “All right.” “Put it back in the deck now.” He goes through the whole thing. “Is this your card?” “No.” “Yes, it is!”', '[audience laughs]', '“Yes!” “That’s your card!” “No.” “You picked that card. Put it back in.” Oh, he got so mad. He just… He didn’t even have to do anything. He could have left the room and come back. “Oh, a magician!” You know, they would have been like… [chuckling] God… [chuckles] [chuckles] It’s always interesting having a conversation with her. You never know what you’re gonna get. And not too long ago, she said, “You didn’t go to college, did you?” I said, “No.” She goes, “That’s a shame. I would have been so proud of you.”', '[audience laughs]', 'I said, “Well, I think I did okay.” “I had that show you liked. Remember the show?” “Yeah, I still watch it every day.” I said, “No, I don’t think so, um…” “Yeah, I watch it every day.” I said, “No, it’s not on anymore.” And she goes, “Then, who am I watching?”', '[audience laughs]', '“Kelly Clarkson. Judge Judy. I don’t know.” “Well, yesterday’s was very good. It was the best one yet.” Okay. You know, I realize now that my whole life was wrapped up in that show, and my mother’s whole identity was being Ellen’s mom. And now I don’t have a show, and she doesn’t know she’s my mom. She just thinks I’m a nice lady that visits her. Although, there’s a good chance she thinks I’m Kelly Ripa, but…', '[audience laughs]', 'But she’s happy, and that’s all that matters.', '[audience cheering]', 'And I’m happy too.', '[audience cheering]', 'Uh… Yeah. I’m happy not being a boss or a brand or a billboard, just a person. Just a multifaceted person with different feelings and emotions, and I can be happy and sad and compassionate or frustrated. I have OCD and ADD. I’m honest. I’m generous. I’m sensitive and thoughtful. But I’m tough and I’m impatient and I’m demanding. I’m direct. I’m a strong woman.', '[audience cheering]', '[mouthing] Thank you.', '[cheering continues] Thank you. Thank you so much. I’m proud of who I’ve become. When you’re a public figure, you’re open to everyone’s interpretation. I’m sure you’ve heard the saying, “What other people think of me is none of my business.” People will say all kinds of things, and you have no control over that. But you know the truth, and that’s all that matters. But that is easier said than done because being in this business, I have had to care what people think. Because being a comedian or a host, it’s our only real currency for success. If they like you, you’re in, and if they don’t, you’re out. And I’ve spent an entire lifetime trying to make people happy, and I’ve cared far too much what other people think of me. So the thought of anyone thinking that I’m mean was devastating to me, and it consumed me for a long time. But with time, you gain perspective, which is one good thing about aging. It doesn’t totally make up for arthritis and brittle bones, but…', '[audience laughs]', 'But with perspective, you realize that caring what people think, to a degree, is healthy. But not if it affects your mental health.', '[audience cheering]', 'So after a lifetime of caring, I just can’t anymore. So I don’t.', '[audience cheering]', 'But, if I’m being honest…', '[audience laughs]', '…and I have a choice of people remembering me as someone who is mean, or someone who is beloved. “Belove-ed”? “Beloved”?', '[audience laughs]', 'Beloved. Someone who is beloved? Someone who is “belove-ed.” Beloved. “Beloved-ed.” Someone who’s beloved. Someone who is “beloved-ed.” Someone who is beloved. I choose that.', 'Thank you.', '[audience cheering]', '[whooping]', 'Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Have a seat. Thank you so much. Wow. Wow. [audience whooping] Well… Wow. Um… First of all… First of all, that was just, um, unbelievably beautiful, and, um… You know, there is just nothing better than being surrounded by endorphins and joy, and we don’t get that that often now, and this was beautiful tonight. This was absolutely…', '[audience cheering]', 'I, um… [clears throat] I had no intention of doing a special. I had no intention of doing anything ever again after the show. And I really, uh… I didn’t think I’d ever find the funny in it. And the fact that I have been able to travel and do this and see the love and support that is still there for me, which I didn’t know I had.', '[audience cheering]', 'Um… It is… It’s been… It’s been beyond healing to say the words every night, to-to feel the support and the love. And so I am so glad I got to do this. I’m so glad I got to say goodbye on my terms, and I can’t thank you enough.', '[audience cheering]', 'Um… This is a night I will always remember.

That’s what they call me, a observational comic. I observe things, and I talk about it. I’m not one of these slip-on-banana-peel, pie-in-the-face-ass fucking comedians and shit, you know? If you noticed, I barely moved all night.', '[audience laughing]', 'I’m a observational motherfucker and shit. So that’s all I was doing.

Anytime you meet a woman, fellas, you gotta ask her, “What temperature are you?” Yeah. You gotta ask that. You don’t want to be spending time with her, y’all start liking each other, hanging out and stuff, then you start going over her house, and you find out her house 90 motherfucking degrees.

From childhood memories of watching Goodness Gracious Me with his grandparents to dealing with societal changes, class, and multiculturalism in the UK, Shah blends humor and poignant storytelling. The show covers themes of identity, family sacrifice, love, and the generational impact of immigration, all while maintaining his trademark wit and insightful social commentary.', '* * *', '[man] In January 1998, a seven-year-old boy was sat on the floor of his grandparents’ living room in Alperton, North West London. Three generations gathered round the telly to watch episode one of this new show on the BBC. Now, the boy’s grandparents had had tough lives, right? The sort of lives that clad you in an armour, and it’s the sort of armour from which laughter struggles to escape. But for the next half hour, the boy and his family watched episode one of Goodness Gracious Me, and he listened as his grandparents fucking pissed themselves laughing at themselves and with themselves for the first time he could remember. And watching Sanjeev Bhaskar, Meera Syal, Nina Wadia and Kulvinder Ghir on television, the boy thought, “Wait, we can do that?! I didn’t know we could do that.” “But if we get to do that, then I wanna do that,” because hearing my grandparents make that sound is the best sound I’ve ever heard in my entire life. Over 25 years later, would you please welcome to the stage Mr Ahir Shah.', 'Hello! Hello!', 'Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.', 'Good evening, London. Are we well?', '[cheering and applause] Fantastic, fantastic. Lovely to have you here. Lovely to have you in such fine voice. Hello! Uh, my name is Ahir Shah. That is my name, by the way, right? I didn’t used to need to clarify this, until a few years ago, I was doing this gig in Switzerland… I was doing a gig in Switzerland, and the theme of this gig was that every comedian was from a different country, right? I was the British entrant. Very modern.', 'Right? And…', '[laughter] There was one comedian I was particularly excited to meet ’cause this guy’s name was Ali Al Sayed. Now, Ali is a stand-up comedian from the United Arab Emirates, of all places, right? I’d never met anyone from the United Arab Emirates, let alone a comedian from the United Arab Emirates. To be perfectly honest, I didn’t think they had comedians in the United Arab Emirates. I assumed he’d just be walking onstage being like, “What’s the deal with unspeakable oil wealth?”', '[laughter]', \"He’s a very nice man, a very funny man. After the show, all the comedians, we’re all backstage hanging out. We’re all having a laugh, having a drink. Not Ali, obviously. Right, and… We get to talking, and he says to me, “Like, uh, listen, bro.” “We’re friends now. I can ask you a question.” “You’re not gonna get offended.” I’m like, “Listen, brother.” “You’re from Dubai. I’m of South Asian origin.” “As long as the question you have for me is not, ‘Do you want a job on a construction site?'”\", '[laughter]', 'Industrialised slavery. “You can ask me whatever the hell you like.” He’s like, “Nothing like that. I was just wondering.” “When did you decide to start using the hilarious comedy stage name Ahir Shah?” Right? I was like, “To be honest, I don’t remember, but it was probably 28th December 1990 when I plopped out of Mrs Shah, and she and Mr Shah decided to call their newborn bundle of joy Ahir.” “I think that’s about when I started going by Ahir Shah.” He’s like, “Right, right, okay.” “One thing you should know, in case you’re ever in my neck of the woods, is that in Arabic, your name means Prostitute King!”', 'He wasn’t even fucking with me. Ahir Shah is “prostitute king” in Arabic. There are several reasons I didn’t think my career would go stratospheric in Saudi. Humble enough to know that I don’t have the best bone-saw material on the circuit. That’s Romesh, and fair enough. Right, but, uh… I put this to the back of my mind for several years, as you would, until, uh, November 2022. I was in Egypt doing some work around the COP climate conference. They speak Arabic in Egypt, and I don’t know if anyone else in the room has ever walked into a hotel and attempted to check in by announcing themselves to everyone working there as “Monarch of all Pimps”?', 'Really changes the vibe in a lobby, in my experience. They think you’re selling something very different to what you are. Anyway, that’s me, then. Ahir Shah. Prostitute King to my friends. Mr Shah to you, and, uh… It’s been a while since I’ve done a big show like this. A lot’s changed in the world, in my life. A lot’s changed in my life. I’m now very much in my thirties now. That’s exciting. Shit started falling apart way younger than I was led to believe, by the way. I thought I had another good decade left in me. As it stands, everything’s already just crumbling. My knees are already fucked. Absolutely no idea what’s going on there. I’m trying desperately to get a referral from my GP, right… Sorry, for younger people… Right, um, a GP… Right… So a GP was a service where, like…', 'Young fellow. How old are you, mate?', 'Twenty-two. Twenty-two. So you might remember but in the same way you remember iPods. You never had one, but you’re vaguely aware they existed. Okay, so basically, like, a GP was this, like… Right, imagine you’re a bit poorly. Not super poorly but a bit poorly. What would happen was there was this number you called, and someone answered, right, and, uh… Not even necessarily at eight in the morning. Any time during business hours. Very forthcoming. Uh, so you’d call them, and you’d be like, “Oh, I’m a bit poorly,” and they’d be like, “Ah, cool. Come see us, soon.”', 'Right? And so a couple of days, days, a couple of days later, what would happen was you went over to this… Right. It looked like a semi-detached house. It wasn’t. That was the first trick they played. It’s like a sphinx’s riddle. Past that, you were golden. You’d arrive, like, 10, 15 minutes early. You’re a conscientious person. And you’d sit in a sort of, uh, waiting room, and after about 10, 15 minutes, someone would call your name, and you’d go to a separate, smaller room, and there would just be one guy in there, and he would be like… I mean, he would, right? ‘Cause we’ve quite a reassuring manner in a lanyard. Right? And you’d tell this person what sort of poorly that you were, and this was a very well-educated person, so you could just be fixed then and there, but occasionally, it’d be a slightly more complex health need, and you’d get a referral to a hospital, right? Sorry. Right. A hospital. Now… Have you ever wondered where the queue of ambulances ends? Right? That is a building known as a “hospital”.', 'Funny word, isn’t it? Interesting thing. You were born in one. You’ll die in one. Between then, you’re fucked. Sorry. Right, uh, basically that… I’m obviously being slightly disingenuous. There are quite a lot of them. Generally speaking, they were all either built or done up when the prime minister’s name was either Attlee, Wilson, or Blair. Not sure why. Not sure why! It’s just a coincidence, isn’t it? What possible intellectual merit could there be in examining why that might have ended up being the case of all things? Fourteen fucking years! Fourteen wasted fucking years! Like, not entirely wasted, obviously. There have been some genuine achievements of Conservative government. I mean that entirely sincerely, by the way. My favourite of which is, like… Basically, it’s funny. If you ignore all of the noise and just look at the actual underlying data, over the last 14 years, the Tories so successfully decarbonised the British economy and energy mix, including all imported emissions, that if the countries responsible for the lion’s share of emissions had been anything like as impressive as we’ve been over the last 14 years, global warming basically wouldn’t be a thing. The Tories did that. They did it on purpose. It is spectacularly impressive, and they can’t admit it ’cause they think it sounds gay. Other than that, it’s slim pickings out there. Really is. Genuinely. It’s worse than it’s been my entire adult life, for sure. Listen, the vibes are awful out there. We’re genuinely skint, as a collective, in a way that we weren’t in 2010 ’cause, basically, in 2010, the Conservatives were elected by telling a sequence of lies about the British economy and society. That they then spent the next 14 years ensuring were true. Right, and… Is it… We need an election, yeah. We need an election. At this stage, I would settle for a total overthrow of the current system and the installation of one-man dictatorial rule, provided that the man in question was Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, right?', '[whooping and applause]', 'I love that guy! I love Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, so goddamn much.', 'Do you sign up to his email?', 'Oh yeah. You do? You’re a good citizen. Well done, sir. If you do not sign up for it, do your bit for your country. That man is the only thing standing between us and the fucking brink. Right. I love Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, so goddamn… So, for the uninitiated, Martin Lewis, he’s a money-saving expert, and he runs this website called MoneySavingExpert.com, and you get a weekly email, and it’s about money saving and the expertise therein, right? And, um, basically, Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, he set up his business for £80, right? Eight-zero. That’s all it cost. He is now worth 100 million, right? Isn’t that amazing? He gives a lot away to things like Citizen’s Advice ’cause he gives a shit unlike the people in charge. I love that for Martin Lewis. I love that Martin Lewis is rich. Right? Here’s the thing, right? The reason I love it is that Martin Lewis is basically the only person I can think of who’s got properly rich from helping. Do you know what I mean? Take a second to dwell on how rare that is, broadly speaking. ‘Cause there’s no money in helping, is there? We all know that. There’s money in hindering, for sure. Right? There’s no money in helping. Right? When’s the last time any of you were walking down the street and went, “Oh my god, a Lamborghini! Who does that belong to?” And someone’s like, “The lollipop lady.” Right? It doesn’t happen. ‘Cause there’s no money in helping unless you’re Martin Lewis. Because that man is rich as balls, and the way he got there was by getting all of us together and just being like, “Pizza Express. 2 for 1 on Wednesday.” “Dough balls are on me. Don’t worry about it.”', 'It’s gonna take more than Martin Lewis to save us now, the state that we’re in. It’s really bad out there. And it’s weird for me because at the same time as the country I love is so visibly on its knees, I am personally happier than I have ever been in my entire life. And the two things are entirely unconnected, but still, feeling personally happy when your country is suffering feels actively distasteful. Do you know what I mean? I’ve not done it on purpose, but it’s like having Chumbawamba stuck in your head at a funeral. The reason, ladies and gentlemen, that I am happier than I have ever been is that in October of last year, I got married. Yeah. Honestly, she’s the single best thing ever to happen to me. I love her with all my heart. She’s a civil servant. I’m in it for the pension. You have to understand I’m a self-employed man. Before I met her, my retirement plan was just to not live that long. Whereas now, my entire financial security and old age is wholly dependent on not upsetting one woman till the day I die. Right? That’ll be a new personal best, mate. In this economy, I’ll try anything, right? I’d always known that I wanted to get married eventually. I guess there was a certain degree of cultural expectation as well. I don’t know what to tell you. In Asian families, you get married, you stay married. It’s just what happens. Some of you may know this from your own families, maybe friends’ families. You might not be aware of the sheer extent to which this is the case, so I’ll give you the best example I have. I started doing stand-up comedy when I was a teenager, right? When I was about 17 years old, I was given the opportunity to do five minutes at the Hackney Empire theatre in East London. That’s a very big theatre. 1500 people. Some of you may well have been. It’s the coolest thing that had ever happened to me. I was on in the first section, so I invited my mum, my dad and my sister to come watch, and they saved me a seat so I could watch in the second section. And the reason I was invited in the first place is that the Hackney Empire were putting on an evening of British Asian stand-up, and I, as the new kid on the block, they were like, “Let’s give little Ahir a go.”', 'That’s nice, isn’t it? And so the whole audience, sold-out show, 1500 people, all British Asian. All of the performers, British Asian, apart from… right… about two hours before the show started, one of the acts suddenly had to drop out. Now, this is the noughties. It’s not like nowadays where everyone’s got email on their phones. They had to ring around, try and find a replacement. A replacement was found in the form of my friend the comedian Joe Bor. Right? Now, Joe is a very nice man. He’s a very funny man. What Joe is not is a British Asian man. Right? What Joe is is a Jewish man. Clearly, with two hours on the clock, one of the organisers was like, “Fuck! I…” [muttering] “I think Jews are basically Asian. I…”', 'Listen, I’m not saying there aren’t similarities between the communities. My best mate’s Jewish. We’ve been mates since we were 14 years old, and it’s ’cause the first time we met, he told me about his mum, and everything that his mum did was either shit that my mum did or hadn’t thought of yet. There’s one crucial difference between the communities, as my friend the comedian Joe Bor found out to his dismay that evening. Because my friend the comedian Joe Bor walked onstage in front of 1500 brown faces and opened with the line, “My parents are divorced.” “Gimme a cheer if your parents are divorced.”', 'Fucking nothing! Not a single sound from 1,500 people. I will never forget my mother leaning over and whispering in my 17-year-old ear, “Bless him. He has no idea who he’s talking to.”', 'So what happens in Asian families, for better or for worse, you get married, you stay married. I come from a very long line of very long-married people. Uh, my parents met at a mutual friend’s birthday party in India in 1979. Fell in love at first sight. My dad proposed that night. They have been married for almost 45 years. Right? Um… By the standards of my mum’s family, by the way, my parents had had quite an extensive courtship, uh, prior to that. I mean, like, well, her parents, my maternal grandparents, Nanaji and Nanima, I mean, the first conversation they had with one another, just, like, one-on-one, was on the night, like, several hours after they were already married, right? It’s 1955 in India. It was arranged. I don’t know what to tell you. Like, they weren’t complete strangers to one another. That would be silly. It’s, like, the families had exchanged a photograph. Uh… Right? And, um… these pieces of paper with a few bits of biographical information on them. Imagine getting shown that when you’re, like, 19, 20.', '“Is this who you’d like to marry forever?”', '“Oh yeah, I guess.”', 'Then, in the end, very happily married for nearly a half century until my grandfather sadly died relatively young. It’s so funny talking about this in front of liberal London audiences. Like, it’s just like, you all know that outwardly you have to be like, “Oh.” “The mysteries of the East.” Uh… “A rich cultural tapestry that may be interwoven with our own.”', 'Internally, you’re all just thinking, “That’s fucking barbaric.”', '“The thing is, that’s fucking barbaric, sorry.” “You mean to tell me that two people barely out of their teens, and all they had to go on was a photograph and a few bits of scant biographical information, and within a matter of days, they were in bed together?” “That is fucking disgusting.” “We would never do anything so crass and horrific in our contemporary, enlightened Western…”', '[laughter and applause]', 'Sorry, just because you’ve decided to do it via algorithm, not “old woman in your village”, does not make it less arranged, right? All you’ve decided to do is outsource responsibility to the one thing somehow less accountable, all right? My wife and I obviously had a far more conventional relationship, uh, prior to getting engaged, meeting in this country and whatnot. It took me a long time to work up the courage to pop the question, as they say, mate. We were going out five weeks, and I asked her to marry me. Um… I get shit done. There’s no point pissing about if you know you know. So just get it… get it done. No point leaving stuff on your to-do list for six months. Things are worth doing quickly and well. It’s the single best decision I ever made. Absolutely no downside. Admittedly, we were engaged for six months before we could start living together just because, like, our tenancy agreements didn’t… Spent half my life on a fucking bus. Then, eventually, obviously, we were able to finally move in together, but all that meant was we were two people in our early thirties living in London joining households, so now, we rent one roof that contains two copies of every Ottolenghi book and no realistic pathway to homeownership. [chuckles] I love my Ottolenghi books though. Not giving those up, even for a house. Might need the spares. Love my Ottolenghi books. Hey, mate, you got an Ottolenghi book?', 'Ah yeah, I love it.', 'Yeah? That’s the sort of thing you can afford when you get the Martin Lewis email. Love my Ottolenghi books.', '“For this recipe, you will need two limes that were once briefly glimpsed by a Persian widow.”', '“Or, if they don’t have that in a shop near you, just any lime.”', 'The thing is, you think it’s bullshit, but I got some of the widow limes, and you can taste the grief. It’s good stuff, actually. The salt from the tears adds real depth of flavour. I think that, shy of having children with someone, I think getting engaged, getting married, it’s like the most optimistic bet that two people can make on the future. Just this idea that you can sincerely look at someone and say, “Our lives could be joined in something greater than the sum of its parts stretching forward for the rest of them.”', 'That’s an extraordinarily optimistic way to feel, right? At the same time as it feels like we’re embarking on the most optimistic journey of a lifetime, it feels like the country around us has just given up. You know what I mean? It’s very difficult not to feel like this entire place has called last orders, isn’t it? It is acutely difficult not to feel deeply pessimistic about every element of the future of this country. Right? That’s weird enough for me as we’re beginning this optimistic journey, but it’s doubly weird when I think about the fact that if I were able to get into a time machine and travel to 1964, when my grandfather, younger than I am now, became the first member of our family to set foot on these shores, and I would just explain the present to him, he would not believe me because he would think I was describing some unimaginable utopia of progress. So that’s really what I’m trying to do. To take a step back, view things through a wider lens, a generational lens, get some perspective, not be so blinkered, try not to lose the wood for the trees. ‘Cause the story of my family is a very typical one for the British Indian community. I think that’s a very relevant story to the past, present and future of this country, right? British Indians are, by a very long margin, the largest minority-ethnic group in this country. Hindus, again we’re talking about millions upon millions… None of you know any of that because our entire cultural output consists of my mate Nish. Right? And… The story of the Indian community in this country, by and large, starts, as it did for my family, in the 1960s and has ended up, in the 2020s, with us now running everything?', '“Rishi bhai did it!”', '“Rishi bhai did it! Never thought I’d live to see the day that Rishi bhai did it.”', '“Got that big house in the middle of town now, baby.”', '“Rishi bhai did it!”', 'Listen, politically, I’m furious. Racially, thrilled. Ah! Are you kidding me? On an ethnic level, couldn’t be happier for him and his family. Increasingly worried about mine. Very much how I used to feel every time I saw Suella Aunty on the television. “Jesus Christ, calm down, Suella Aunty. You’re gonna get us both killed.”', 'Right, uh… I’m gonna talk about the prime minister a little bit. Obviously, I’ve got to be relatively careful what I say about him because we can all agree there’s about a 70% chance that a decade from now, I will play him in a Channel 4 drama. Right, right… Not gonna burn a bridge before I’ve even crossed it. Are you kidding me? I need that money. I just wish that I could get across, like, how wild that day was, right? I… A British Indian, devout Hindu, son of immigrants, became prime minister of Britain on Diwali. That was a very difficult day in the family WhatsApp for me. Get the family WhatsApp up on my phone. Yes, it’s called the Asian Network. See “Dad is typing…” Wait for the inevitable. “Ahir, have you seen what Mr Sunak’s son has done today?” “Still, Ahir, you enjoy mocking your week. I’m sure that’s nice for you.”', 'I’m glad the shine’s come off him now. Everyone knows he’s not really up to it. At the beginning, you all acted like he was the perfect Indian boy. At the beginning, everyone acted like he was the perfect Indian boy. It’s ’cause you just go off the CV on paper. Right? You don’t know what I know. What does it say on the CV? Fucking anyone could’ve done that. What? Piece of piss. Who cares? What? All right, fair enough. What’s the guy done? Fair enough. Does well at school. Gets into Oxford. Does well at Oxford. Gets into Stanford. Does well at Stanford. Starts working in finance. Becomes a multi-multimillionaire in his own right in his twenties, largely through executing positions as a big short in 2007-2008 that makes him rich enough that he’d never have to work again. No one even reflects on that ’cause at Stanford, he meets and eventually marries the daughter of a genuine Indian billionaire, who’s a very successful businesswoman in her own right. They move to the United Kingdom where he becomes an MP at an obscenely young age, Chancellor at an obscenely young age, during one of the worst financial crises this country’s experienced, then prime minister, at an obscenely young age, of the country that colonised and expropriated the wealth of his ancestors, leading to complex migratory patterns, in his family’s case, via East Africa, landing him on the doorstep of the most significant address in this country on the most significant day of his faith, and everyone acts like he’s the perfect Indian boy. Feel free to look this up. It is genuinely true. Rishi Sunak never made his school cricket team. I was captain of mine.', '[cheering and applause]', 'That’s right! That is right! Any Indian father would dropkick the prime minister into a canal to get me. All right? Know what I mean?', '“Who cares about Rishi Sunak? I want Ahir Tendulkar. Mmm.”', '“Hearing a lot about Number Ten. Should be batting at number four.”', '“That’s classy.”', 'His family came here in the ’60s too. Like, I… I think about that sometimes. Getting into my time machine and travelling to that cold bedsit in Bradford and explaining to my grandfather that when his grandson was a bit older than he was then, not only would this be the case, but I think the bit that he’d struggle with the most is that it’s not a thing. Do you know what I mean? The news was just like, “And the prime minister, Rishi Sunak,” and everyone’s like, “Yeah, that makes sense.”', 'It is remarkable how unremarkable it is, right? That’s a thing that’s worth reflecting upon. Listen, I’ll always talk about the things we do badly as a country. I think one of the things we do terribly as a country is never discussing anything we do well as a country. And I do think that when we’re at our best, Britain stands basically alone, certainly in Europe, probably in the world, as an example of what a properly successful multiethnic, multicultural democracy can look like in practice in the 21st century. That’s something that is worth discussing. It’s why I hate it when you get people on the far right decrying that multiculturalism is some grand failed experiment, when you can see its successes if you bother to open your eyes. It’s why I can’t stand it when people on my own “team”, right? I don’t like teams in the first place, but listen. I voted remain, but whenever people are like, “It was only the European Union that gave us our values of tolerance and decency to…”', 'Fuck off! Anyone else in the room ever been to continental Europe while not white? It’s not the relaxing holidaying experience that some of the rest of you may enjoy. Genuinely. A couple of years ago, I had to go to this wedding in France. I genuinely… The way people were… I kept asking people I was with… Like, I thought I had something on me. Turns out I did! Gonna get an Algerian president of France anytime soon, or reckon the fash’ll get there first? Same question for Germany, you know? Listen, I think that Britain stands basically alone in this. That’s worth reflecting on, right? I remember when I was 20 years old, walking across the Meadows on the south side of Edinburgh with my friend the Indian American comedian Hari Kondabolu, right? I said to him, “Hari bhai…“', 'I think that when you’re part of any sort of visible minority, whatever that minority might be, what you fundamentally want in life, it’s not necessarily different treatment or special treatment. Rather, it is the ability, eventually, to get to go without saying. To be part of what is. Just to, sort of, get to be normal. I think if you get to be normal 24-7, you probably don’t realise how cool it is to get to be normal all the time. And does political representation get us there in and of itself? Of course it doesn’t, right? We know this for a fact. Rishi Sunak, not even the first PM from a minority-ethnic background. First, way back in the 19th century, Benjamin Disraeli, also a Tory, right? Would you say that antisemitism does not exist in contemporary Britain? That would be a fucking stupid thing to say. But maybe these things are indicative of the fact that, in societies, we can, over time, move towards a position where more and more people can be brought into the circle of who gets to go without saying, until that sphere is eventually expanded to include everyone, which is where it should’ve been in the first fuckin’ place. I have had the very great privilege of seeing a large amount of this world through these eyes. I have been to many countries, cities, continents doing this, and I can comfortably say that Britain is, yes, as the cliché goes, “the least racist country in the world”.', 'It just says a shitload more about the world than about Britain. Right? And please do not interpret this as any sort of grand political point. I think the guy’s a fucking appalling prime minister. He’s, like, genuinely terrible, and no one voted for any of this. It is abysmal what is happening to us at the moment. I do not agree with his politics, but… By the way, that’s when you know that something historic’s happened. People use phrases like, “I may not agree with the politics, but…” [emphatically] No one felt the need with David Cameron. It’s just nice for someone like that to get a girl, isn’t it? Right, but Sunak and Cameron are basically the same guy ’cause they went to fancy school. That’s what explains it. Fancy school, and fancy school runs the country. That is not the school that I think about when I think about the prime minister. The school that I think about is quite a long time ago and quite a long way away. In April 1919, an event occurred in Amritsar, Punjab, at the time British India, that is now known to history as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre. This is when thousands of entirely unarmed civilians, peaceful protesters and pilgrims were kettled into a very, very small area, and tens of thousands of rounds of machine-gun fire were opened up intentionally on these entirely unarmed civilians, at least 379 of whom were murdered, probably many more, though we’ll never know the true total, and thousands more had life-defining injuries thereafter. It is one of the worst and most well-documented cases of colonial atrocities of British rule in India. I’ve known about that a very long time. What I did not know about, until an investigation in The Times last year, was that subsequent to the massacre in Amritsar, there was a sequence of additional smaller massacres perpetrated in towns and villages surrounding Amritsar as the word got out in order to stop the possibility of any subsequent civilian uprisings, including one that happened in a place called Gujranwala, right? Now, Gujranwala, it’s about 100 miles away from Amritsar. It’s a border town in contemporary Pakistan. And in Gujranwala, again, thousands of rounds of machine-gun fire were let out at entirely unarmed… just farmers tilling their fields. And over the course of two days, ten bombs were dropped, including one intentionally dropped on the school as a show of “This is how powerful we are and how little of a shit we give about you, so don’t you even think about trying to fuck with us.”', 'One of the survivors of the massacre in Gujranwala was a two-year-old boy named Ramdas. Ramdas’s grandson is, at time of recording, prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', 'Yeah.', '[applause] When… when I think about the last century of world history and what might prove possible over time and generations, I think about the school in Gujranwala rather more than I think about Winchester College. A punchline would feel distasteful.', '[laughter]', 'Right? Obviously, I wasn’t alive at the time, but I reckon the way I feel’s basically how a lot of women felt about Margaret Thatcher in 1979. You don’t need to agree with someone’s politics in order to acknowledge that someone walking through the door means something in and of itself, and that’s the only way you pave the pathway for others to follow. And you can’t deny that it works. You can’t deny that it… Listen. We’ve now had enough white-lady prime ministers that they’re allowed to be instantly shit! That is a staggering achievement for equality in this country. Are you kidding me? Maggie and Theresa walked so Liz could fly. Liz Truss, actually very important from a representational standpoint as well. Uh, I mean that entirely sincerely too. Think about how many prime ministers there must’ve been over however long it’s been. Did you know that Liz Truss is the first who just went to a regular comprehensive school? Isn’t that mad, right? Like, 94% of children go to a regular comprehensive school. I went to a regular comprehensive school. I believe 94% of prime ministers should go to a regular comprehensive school. Admittedly, she wasn’t a great advert for us. Right? “I may not agree with her politics, but…”', 'In case you’re trying to square the circle of the educational background and the accent you’re currently enjoying… Uh, well, uh… What ended up happening there was I went to my local comp in Wembley, North West London. I had a wonderful time there, but it did have a few police vans outside to stop us murdering each other. Very thoughtful of them. Subsequent to that, I ended up going to the University of Cambridge, so I became functionally bilingual in both posh boy and roadman. Uh, uh… A few years ago, I was doing a TV record in Glasgow, and afterwards, I was having a cigarette with my friend the comedian Jamali Maddix. I was there with Jamali, smoking, making small talk.', 'He went, “You went private school, yeah?” I’m like, “Oh no, I didn’t.” “What?”', 'So I talked him through a few basic facts about my childhood, and he just looked at me and went, “Hang on, bruv, are you from ends?”', '[posher accent] “Well, Jamali, one supposes one was.”', 'I’m not gonna do it down. I grew up in a wonderful place. I went to a wonderful school. I hate when people do that down. I… genuinely, it was a really good school. If you avoided gang violence, cousin marriage, it was Ofsted Good. Like, it was a great environment. All the families, by and large like mine. First-, second-generation immigrants. Parents may not have had a lot to give. What they had was the most important. An insistence that education is the best way onward, upward, outward. I think if you’ve got 100 grand, that’s a better thing to give to a child. And blessed with really great teachers. I’ll tell you about one of my favourites, Miss Lewis. Now, Miss Lewis, I think she had previously taught at a private school. I don’t know, but she definitely knew the extras they were given in order to get ahead. Maybe thought that was unfair, right? And so she set up, off her own initiative, like all great teachers do, off her own bat, she set up, for a couple of years, an additional, optional Latin class, of all things. And I, as you can probably imagine, was heavily involved. This is what I mean about the transformative power of education. You could change everything for young people in an instant. I still remember, like it was yesterday, the first time I walked into that gleaming Portakabin bestowed on us by New Labour, and I sat down, and I opened these textbooks that contained these things that I’d never even conceived of before. I was just there being like, “Oh my God, it’s true!” “Caecilius est in horto!”', 'Do you know what I mean, right? Led to probably my single favourite experience of my entire time at high school, which was one time, at the end of term, my boys and I were gonna go cinema ’cause you get a half day. The way that you go to the cinema, you get the 182 from Brent Town Hall. So we were walking to the bus stop, and on the way to the bus stop, there’s this blind alley, right? And a dozen guys came out to rush us and jack us and shit, until one of them just stopped all of the others by going, “Guys, Ahir’s safe, yeah? I know him from Latin.”', 'I sincerely believe I am the only man in the long history of this sceptred isle who has ever avoided a violent mugging because of Latin class. Uh… [chuckles] Nathaniel, gratias tibi. It’s a great environment to grow up in, you know? Not much cash but a lot of ambition. I think that’s a good way around to have it, generally speaking. And realistic ambition as well. The families just had realistic ambitions. The sort of ambition every parent should be able to rely on. The idea that if everyone does their bit, works hard, the next generation might have it a bit easier than the previous one did. That is a reasonable ambition. Parents should be able to rely on that coming true for their children. Right, now this is not an unreasonable ambition. I know all about unreasonable ambition. You don’t need to tell me about… I remember once, when I was at uni, entirely unironically telling my mate Ali that by the time I was in my thirties, I wanted to be GQ magazine’s World’s Best Dressed Man. Right? I am now in my thirties and will settle for “Dressed Man”.', '[chuckles] And that’s a stretch most days. Listen, we all know, fundamentally, that any sort of vision of progress has to take into account generational investment. I think that the part that we’ve forgotten is that the flip side of that coin has always been generational sacrifice. Now, I might not know much about generational investment yet, but I feel like, through example, I at least know something about generational sacrifice because every day after primary school, I would go to my grandparents’ house in Alperton, North West London, and I would see generational sacrifice continuing to write itself on the faces of Nanaji and Nanima. Now, quick note on language. I speak another language. It’s called Gujarati. “Nanaji” just means your mum’s dad. You have different words for both sides of the family. So maternal grandfather, that’s nanaji. As you can imagine, I write a lot of stuff on my computer. My computer refuses to accept the existence of the word “nanaji” and will insist on autocorrecting it every time to the word “Navajo”. Which has led to three instances where I, alone at home, have yelled at a computer screen, “Wrong sort of Indian!”', 'Now, Nanaji was the first member of my family to arrive in this country when he was in his twenties in 1964. He is probably the reason that I was born here in the first place. He is the reason for so much. Even though he died a fair while ago now, he’s probably the largest part of the reason why I ended up sounding like this, right? When he was eventually reunited with his wife and children in this country, he said to the children, including my mother, “Listen, when you’re outside, you’re not allowed to speak to one another in Gujarati any more.” “You live somewhere called England now, so you need to learn how to speak like proper little Englishmen and women.” “And then if you learn how to do that, maybe one day, they’ll learn how to accept you.”', 'And it sounds kind of weird to our contemporary ears, but this was a very commonplace thing in the ’60s and ’70s. A sort of, like, vocal version of dressing for the job you want. You ever heard that phrase, right? And this has been entirely useless for me, but, like, my uncle is a doctor. Can you imagine if your doctor looked and sounded like me? You’d be fucking thrilled. Imagine that, he’s doing the ward rounds, just like, “Oh, good morning. How are we feeling today?” You’re thinking, “This motherfucker’s gonna cure me in two hours.” “Make lunch plans!”', 'Now, Nanaji could never integrate in that way himself, so I think that his way of doing it was that he worked a succession of almost comically English jobs, right? So for the most part of his career, until he retired, he worked at John Lewis. Worked on the shop floor, selling curtains, fabrics ’cause it’s what he knew from the textile factories back in India. That’s probably the most English place anyone could possibly work. You’re not gonna get a more English place to work than the John Lewis Partnership. Unless the job you had before that was conductor on the big, red bus! “Fair play. That’s the most English place anyone could possibly work.” “You can’t hit us with a more English workplace than the big, red bus.”', 'Unless the first job you had in this country was literally at the baked-bean factory! It’s where it all started. Baked-bean factory in Bradford. 1964, baby. Came over here. Work on those beans. Now, uh, crucially, he did not want to, uh, right? By that stage, been married for just under a decade. Had three children. Had friends. Enjoyed his work in the textile factory. Thought he might be able to work his way up and everything. Very little interest in the United Kingdom. Hitherto no interest in beans, right? But, um… It was my grandmother who pushed this. Like, Nani, quite understandably, was like, “Listen, just…” India at the time is just poorer and more violent than anyone with the dumb luck of having been born in this country can remotely conceive of. And so she, quite understandably, was like, “Listen, these children aren’t gonna have the life we wanna give them over here, but they’re taking people in England.” “So I need you to go over there. You just work it out, right?” “I’ll stay here with the children. You send money back to us.” “When you’ve saved up enough, we’ll come join you.” “All right. Cool. See you later. Bye.”', 'Uh… He just did it, like, pretty soon thereafter. Just went… Like, listen, I like to think that I’m gonna be a pretty, sort of, accepting, thoughtful, 50-50 type of husband, right? However, if, just under a decade from now, my wife is to tell me that I must leave her and our three children to move to a different continent with no guarantee of when I would see them again, no way of communicating with them, no guarantee if any of it was going to work out and no guarantee of my own personal safety, that would not be the end of the conversation. Right? However, of course, for Nanaji, it was. How could it not be? That’s your dharma. That’s your duty. You have to do it. It’s your duty to your family, right? So he came over, not entirely on his own. Came with a couple of other guys who did the same, left the wives and kids. But they didn’t really see each other that much for a few years ’cause they ran a system called the eight-eight-eight, right? The eight-eight-eight is a system whereby, as mathematicians in the room can confirm, if three men each have two jobs, the shifts of which are eight hours long, and you time the shift patterns correctly and work seven days a week, you only need to rent one bed in one room because one of you can be asleep at any given time while the other two are at work. One guy finishes his second shift, comes back, hits you awake, you go off to your first one, he falls asleep. Do that again and again. Saves two-thirds on the rent. That’s more that you can send to the wives and kids in India. And that’s the largest expense, isn’t it? What’s the second-largest expense? Probably food. But food, taken care of. ‘Cause at the baked-bean factory, they give you a tin of beans. Protein. Very important. For the second meal of the day, they had a big sack of rice, and they’d have some boiled rice in a pot. Apart from Sundays, obviously, because Sunday is treat day, so the boiled rice contained an onion, right? Some of you are probably thinking, “Surely, even in 1964, onions are cheap.” “Anyone could have onions whenever they wanted.”', 'From what you have heard so far about my nanima, do you believe she is the sort of woman who would have tolerated the profligacy of a seven-a-week onion habit? It’s what you needed to do. It’s what they needed you to do, so it’s what you did. Eight-eight-eight, 24-7, 365. Five. Five years. He didn’t see his wife or children for five years. Imagine that. It’s not like, “At least I’ve got a good data plan” or something like that. Forget about calling. That was never gonna happen. Letters? Couple of letters a year. Each time you write one, you feel a bit closer. Every time you buy a stamp, you’re driving them further away. To the extent that my mum’s first memory in this country is Heathrow Airport, 1969. Her, her brother and sister all sort of hid behind their mum because they were just like, “Who’s this man?” Right? “Who’s this big man?” Right? Just like, “Why’s he smiling at me?” “Why’s he got these tears in his eyes?” “I guess he looks like that photograph that Mummy cries over sometimes if anyone ever hums that song, you know?”', 'I think about that a lot too, right? Imagine that. Trying to raise three children on your own for five years, occasionally just crying over a single photograph and a handful of letters. Should’ve cried over a lime. She’d have made some money. Family reunited in 1969, the year after a very prominent Conservative politician got on a soapbox in Birmingham and said, “We must be mad, literally mad, to be permitting the annual inflow of dependents, who are, for the most part, the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population.” “It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre.” Now, Mr Powell was correct about one thing in that that little girl hidden behind the sari did become part of the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population. Because that’s quite a mouthful, my sister and I tend to go with “Mum”.', 'Imagine that. Bringing your wife and kids into that the year after Rivers of Blood, when you’ve been here on your own since ’64, the same year as the Smethwick campaign. Right? It’s fucking grim. Right, just like the violence, the aggression, that goes without saying. It’s also… It’s always the more insidious stuff that cuts the deepest, yeah? The thing, I suppose, like, nowadays, we acknowledge as having broken him was that he was eventually, uh, accused of quite serious theft from the workplace, uh, which was, like… Suspended and investigated for ages. Entirely cleared. He’d obviously not done it. But it didn’t take a genius to work out eventually when you hear these stories, that it all starts with a couple of guys at the place being like, “Who do you reckon they’re gonna believe, eh?”', 'Imagine what that does to you. Like, your dignity and stuff. You have to do it again though. Tomorrow. You have to get up, brave face, for the kids. For the kids. It’s not like the kids have it any easier. There has been so much more progress in the last 20 years in this country than there was in the 40 that preceded it, and I feel very comfortable saying that because I went to exactly the same high school as my mum and my uncle. My abiding memory of that school is a funny story about the time when I didn’t get mugged ’cause of Latin. Ha-ha-ha. My uncle’s abiding memory of that school is the people who would flick lit cigarettes at him every day when he walked to and from it. My mum’s abiding memory of that school sticks with her to this day because every time she wants to eat something, she has to change her clothes entirely, cook, eat, change her clothes entirely again. No matter how many times I tell her that the smell of spices hitting hot oil is the most beautiful smell in the world, all she hears is a decade of children telling her how much she stank. And he died in 2002, so he died only remembering the shit bit, and he wasn’t old, so if he’d just hung on, he would have seen how quickly it was going to get so different. You could have at least seen a bit of that before you left. Right, in 2016, I’m on a train, reading a newspaper. Sorry, mate. A newspaper. Right, um… Imagine, like, a solid tweet. Right, and… and… On a train, reading a newspaper, and it’s the day before the mayoral election in London, and there’s this big feature article, uh, where basically Sadiq Uncle is walking around the city, meeting the various voters and talking to them. In the feature, there’s this one guy. I’ve forgotten his name. It was a West African name, I think. He’s there with his five-year-old son, and he says to him, “Son, I want you to shake this man’s hand.” “This is Mr Khan.” “Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London.”', 'And in that moment of reading that, like, my hands stopped working, and the paper fell from my hands, and the tears fell from my eyes as I thought about the fact that he died in a society where the sentence, “This is Mr Khan. Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London,” was completely impossible, right? And yet 14 years later, it had become totally inevitable. So what would he have made of witnessing the change in society necessary to make that happen and landing on that sentence in that paper? What would he have made of reading a sentence like that? What would he have made of reading the words, “This is Mr Khan. Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London”? Probably not much. I don’t think he really liked Muslims. “I may not agree with his politics, but…” And that’s how I felt Diwali before last, you know? Lit my divo, I went outside. I went back into the kitchen, and I poured a little glass of whisky, and I said, “You finding today interesting, eh?”', 'It’s, like, obviously, problems still exist. None of this is to negate any of the problems that we’re all too aware of, right? But at the same time, pretending that the sort of stuff that I have and have had to contend with is in any way comparable to the sort of things that they had to deal with feels genuinely offensive to me. ‘Cause this was the generation that never talked about it and so never had it acknowledged, and it’s worth acknowledging. ‘Cause they’re the ones who changed so much to make so much of what happens now possible, right? I’m not an idiot. I wander around doing this for a living, all around the country. Occasionally, people shout ignorant shit at me in the street. Like, I’m not oblivious to that. And listen, my wife is a white Irish lady. Sometimes the two of us are going about our business, out and about, and people see us together. They don’t like that too much. They make their opinions known. They’re all so fuckin’ old, right? So old. Like, proper fossils, and… When I was a teenager, it would really… Like, I’d be ready to fight, and now a part of my brain just can’t help but think, “F… I think maybe you lost,” right? No, not… Lost isn’t correct ’cause it’s not like society’s a football match where someone blows the whistle and we decide what the result’s been. But at the very least, I can acknowledge that I’m not the one who scored the goals. I’m a sub. They’re the ones who scored the goals. They scored the goals and ran straight back to the net and pulled it back to the halfway line ’cause they knew that no matter how hard they were trying every single day, they were still, 1969, two down, right? And is the point of my generation one more not only of maintenance but also trying not to lose grip on this extraordinarily fragile thing that exists around us? It’s worth acknowledging how fragile this thing is, right, because you see people, young people, trying, once again, to sow, sort of, any sorts of division in this society we’re trying to build. And you just think, “What the fuck are you doing?” “What are you doing?”', 'Surely, the point… If the point is anything, the point is to create a society in which, one day, everyone’s children get to go without saying. I think that you have to be staggeringly naive to believe that that’s possible, and I refuse to be anything else. It’s so easy to despair, right? Despair is the easiest position to have. It’s definitely my default. It just turns out that despair is a deeply unproductive emotion. Right? Try something else. Yeah? My wife’s way better than me at this. Like, she’s just, generally speaking, quite stable and well adjusted. I used to think that she was some sort of superhero or something. Turned out it’s because she has absolutely no social-media presence whatsoever. Uses the internet sparingly if necessary for work. If we were all slightly more like her, we’d all be slightly less fucking insane. By the way, no one’s changed their names. There’s no Mrs Shah to this story. Fortunately for all of us, in Irish, her name means “Prostitute Queen”.', 'Didn’t even take five weeks, not really. There was a point, one week, stood opposite her in the kitchen, and just all of a sudden, it’s like the trailers stopped. Like all life up to that point had revealed itself to be the trailers, and all of a sudden, every atom of the world outside of the two of us was whispering in unison, “Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh. Shh.” [softly] “The picture’s about to start.” And now I get to see how it goes. That’s it. I mean, the ending’s gonna suck. Right. I’m not gonna know too much about it though. 100% gonna die first. Get in! Love it. Are you kidding me? Listen. It’s like… She’s really like, “Oh no, we shouldn’t have processed food in the house.” And all I want to do in my life is fuck a Chicago Town pizza. While chain-smoking and doing lines of salt. It’s nice to feel like you’ve had one of your last beginnings. Yeah? Frees you up to think about where things end up. It’s the interesting thing with love, right? Love, the way that it begins, begins in as many ways as there are people. If we were ever to have a conversation, and you said to me, “Ahir, can I just check, were you in love on your wedding day?”', 'Wouldn’t that be a ridiculous question? You’d never ask. ‘Cause the answer’s obviously yes, right? What I find fascinating is that, if you were ever to meet my grandmother, and you were to say, “Ramila, can I check, on your wedding day, were you in love?”', 'It would be an equally ridiculous question ’cause the answer would obviously be no. Of course she wasn’t. Right? There she was, little more than a girl, sat opposite little more than a boy. Total strangers, functionally. Of course she didn’t love that boy. Right? And yet it began. It began, right? Wild. Did she love the boy she was sat opposite on her wedding day? Of course she didn’t, right? Did she love the young man just under a decade later, who was willing to move continents because he knew that’s what the people who relied on him needed from him in that moment? Of course she loved that man. She loved that man for the next five years as she held up her end looking after three children, while occasionally taking a moment to cry over a photograph and a handful of letters. Of course she loved that man. She loved that man in Heathrow Airport, 1969, the photograph made flesh once more as those three children hid behind her sari because they barely recognised the man who had done so much for them. Of course she loved that man. She loved that man as she took his hand and walked forward together into a society infinitely more hostile than the one that has been bequeathed to me as a direct result of their actions. She loved that man as they danced together, shielding one another from as many slings and arrows as humanly possible. For the next decades until his end, she loved that man. She loved that man in 2002 and well past that, as you will know if you go to a living room in Alperton, North West London, and see a photograph on the wall with a fresh garland of flowers that you pray to when you visit. Of course she loves that man. That’s where it ends up. Nanaji died in 2002, a week after his birthday. He’d just turned 69. Oi! [chuckles softly] He’d brought a slightly hastened end onto himself, really, uh… Basically, when he retired, he wanted to spend as much time in India as humanly possible, but his lungs had been fucked since his twenties ’cause of the fibres in the air in the textile mills. The place in India my family are historically from, a city called Ahmedabad, it’s incredibly polluted. Makes Central London look like the fucking Peak District. And so he would go over there and come back weaker, diminished. And he came back, and after the second trip, his grown-up children had to get him sat down in his own living room, and my mum had to say to her own dad, “You are killing yourself.” Right? “That’s what’s happening here. That’s what’s… It’s perfectly clear.”', '“You go there. You come back. You’re weaker. You’re smaller.”', '“You’re more diminished.”', '“And can you not see what is happening to you?”', '“It’s not even about seeing. Akshay is a doctor.”', '“He can hear what is happening based on your breath and diagnose you.”', '“Do you not feel what is happening?”', '“So here’s the thing. You’ve had your fun. You’ve had two trips.”', '“But now you stay over here, right?”', '” ‘Cause we love you very much, so we wanna keep you around.”', '“That’s how we’re all gonna look after one another.”', '“So you’ve had your fun, but you’re not allowed to go any more.”', '“Here you are. Good. Yes.”', 'And he had to look at three adult children and say, “No.”', '“I never wanted any of this. Right, I never wanted any…”', '“Like, my entire life, it turns out, has just been this means to an end, and that’s fine. It’s fine because you are the end.”', '“So if I had to do it again, I would, with a snap of the fingers and a smile on my face, I would do it again.”', '“But can you not understand that I just need this at my end?”', '“I can feel it far more than you can see it, or he can hear it.”', '“Do you not understand I don’t care?”', '“I don’t care because when I go over there, no one looks at me like I’m any different or yells at me or spits at me like I’m any different because I’m not any different.”', '“When I go over there, I am a normal guy.”', '“I have been a normal guy since the day I was born.”', '“I just haven’t felt like it in so long.”', '“You don’t understand that when I’m over there, I get to go without saying, and I haven’t gone without saying since nineteen sixty-fucking-four.”', 'He used to run off the plane as quickly as possible, sprint across the tarmac as quick as fucked lungs would carry him, and go to the first part of the airport that wasn’t paved over, fall to his knees and just start digging fistfuls of earth with his bare hands. He would dig up the earth, and he would put it in his mouth. Can you imagine? Dig the earth and put… ‘Cause you miss a land so much that you need to dig it and put it in your mouth. But you had to leave, you had to leave because that’s what they needed, and if they needed it, it’s what you had to do. He would dig the earth and put it in his mouth. It can’t have helped.', '[laughter]', 'A third and final trip to the only place on the face of this earth that would do a normal guy the basic decency of getting to go without saying. And it killed him. That’s how much every human being wants that. You need a pretty damn good reason not to give it to them. When he did die, he died in this country, in a hospital. D’you remember? “Hospital”.', 'And my mother was next to him, sat down. He was in a bed, not speaking any more. It was just the beeps, you know? Most of us have heard the beeps. And a nurse came by, saw my mum, and said, “Oh, you must be Mr Vaishnaw’s daughter.” She said, “Yes, I am.” And the nurse said, “Well, listen, I’m new to the ward, so I didn’t get a chance to speak to him, but I’ve spoken to some of the other nurses who did, and they said he was a good man.”', 'And my mother squeezed the hand of a man she had barely recognised in Heathrow Airport in 1969 and said, “He was the best of men.” And the line went flat. And if Nanaji were capable of hearing in that moment, then the very last thing he heard on this earth was the little girl it had all been for saying that he was the best of men. And, like, objectively, he wasn’t.', '[laughter]', 'Do you know what I mean? Not a baddie, but just, you know, a normal, complex, flawed human being like absolutely everyone in this room. And probably we could give one another a bit more of a break than we currently have the appetite for, I suppose. Yeah? But for someone, for someone, which it turns out is the only way that you can be, of course he was. He was the best of people for someone. He did what they needed from him when they needed it from him. He did the best that he could for the people he loved. If you can do that, then you can be the best of people for someone. If you can do the best you can for the people you love and who rely on you, then you damn well get to go without saying, in my book. It is not that I have currently had some sort of grand revelation that sacrifice is somehow more impressive or important than achievement. The truth is what the truth always was in the first place, which is that the sacrifice is the achievement, and with that in mind, I know full well that till my end, Krishnadas Vaishnaw will remain the most impressive man I will ever meet. I have wanted to do this since January 1998, sat on the floor of my grandparents’ living room in Alperton, North West London, listening to Nanaji and Nanima laugh at episode one of Goodness Gracious Me. And for just over a decade, I have had the absurd privilege of calling it my career. But it’s not the job. Not any more. And it never will be again, I hope. The job, as I understand it, is what Nanaji understood the job to be. He was a good husband and a good father for the people who needed him to be when they needed him to be. He was the best of men. And I am now, in front of you, the World’s Best Dressed Man. [laughter and applause] Because I get to stand in front of you and tell his story while wearing his waistcoat. Because I am finally dressed for the job I want. And it will be the hardest job of a lifetime.', '[in Gujarati] But with you, Nanaji, I’ll be able to do it, I hope. Sorry. “Hope…”', '[laughter]', '[cheering and applause]', 'Thank you very much.', '[Qawwali music playing]', '[music ends]'], ['Langston Kerman: Bad Poetry (2024)\\nDirector: John Mulaney\\nRelease date: August 20, 2024 (Netflix)', '[ambient street noise]', '[applause]', '[emcee] Clap it up, clap it up!

I’m pretending to be a 65-year-old woman trying to get her back blown out…', '[audience laughs]', '…on an elderly dating app called “Sunset Singles.” And I’ll be honest, I’m having the time of my goddamn life. I wake up every day. Before I greet my wife, before I unstick my balls from my thigh, I pick up my phone, I open that app, and I just start flirting. I be flirting with old-ass men in big-ass suits. You know what I mean? Turns out that’s my type. I thought I liked my wife. I don’t. I like a leathery old sea turtle. I like a wooden-teeth-looking motherfucker, with his face too close to the phone in all his pictures. And they be sending me messages like, “Greetings, beloved.” “My name is Ulysses.” “That’s right! The last Ulysses alive on planet Earth.” “All other Ulysses died in the Great Black & Mild War of 1964.” “Anyway, I am electric mailing you this evening…”', '[audience laughs]', '“…to inquire if you might join me on a Cadillac ride to a crab cake dinner.” “I know a place with pictures of Barack Obama in the menu, so you know it’s good.” “Sound enticing?

Oh, you changed your mind? Goddamn turncoat. Okay, this first message… No, nay. This first piece I want to share with you this evening, this first selection, is a little number that I’ve simply entitled “Love.” “Love.” That’s all you need to know.

I asked this motherfucker where he likes to eat. [laughter] I didn’t ask him none of that. He came back with this weird-ass love manifesto. Like, I see why you’re single, sir.

Top five baby, aborted or alive.', 'I love…', '[laughter] I love my baby! Look, hey, hey, hey, when I show people pictures of my baby, and they don’t get excited enough, I be ready to beat they ass. Know what I’m saying? If I show you a picture of my baby, and you just go, “I dunno, she’s cute,” I’d be like, “No, bitch.” “She’s an effervescent beauty.” “I think you meant to say her cheeks remind you of the clouds that wrap around mountaintops.” “Tell me she makes you feel like the warmest day in winter.” “Say you want to kiss her, softly.” “Slowly.” “That’s right.” “You a pedophile for my baby.” “You going to jail, you sick fuck.” “‘Cause you wanna Joe-Biden-sniff my baby.”', 'People say wild shit to me now that I have a kid. You know what I mean? Real maniacal, evil shit. I had a stranger I’ve never met before in my life come up to me the other day and tell me having a baby is the best thing that’s ever gonna happen to me. The best thing. And keep in mind, I once met Forest Whitaker in line at an IHOP.', '[laughter]', 'Ghost Dog. I met him at the International House. This is how it happened, right? I was in line, minding my business, and out of nowhere, Forest Whitaker walked in and he asked to use the bathroom. And then the woman behind the register, she looked at him, she realized, “Holy shit, that’s Forest Whitaker,” and then she said the bathroom was for paying customers only. And Forest Whitaker couldn’t believe it. He was taken aback. He looked at her as if to say, “Ma’am, have you lost your mind?” “I’m Forest goddamn Whitaker.” “You’ve seen my eye.” But the woman didn’t budge a bit. She just looked right back at him and rolled her neck as if to say, “Sir, you ain’t special.” “This is an IHOP.” “Everybody’s got a fucked-up eye.” “We all fucked-up in the ‘HOP.” “That’s how we got here!”', 'And there was this crazy stand-off, right, between Forest Whitaker and the pancake lady, neither one of them budging a bit, and then out of nowhere, my boy, Will… He was outside smoking. He comes back in. He sees Forest Whitaker. He goes, “Oh shit! Forest Whitaker?” “You eat at IHOP?” “Weird choice!” And I’ll never forget it, because Academy-Award-winner Forest Whitaker, he looked at us, he looked at everybody in the restaurant, and he just went, “Man…” “Fuck y’all.” Best thing. Know why “best thing” is crazy? Because you and I, every single person in this room, we’ve all had so many magical experiences that no human should ever have to weigh themselves against. Know what I mean? It’s almost unfair to ask you to compare your greatest joys to another. It’s… Look, hey, I’ve gotten pussy and Cinnabon in the same night. That’s a miracle. This is a better example. Okay, here it is. Okay, this… Okay. Last year, for my birthday, right, me and my friends, we did a shit-ton of mushrooms, right? We got super-high on mushrooms. Real fucked up on mushrooms. And then, we went to a public park, we sat on a bench, and then we heckled an adult softball league. You understand? That’s how I celebrated my 35th birthday. And I’ll be honest, that’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. So much funnier than a baby. This is why it was dope. Because those people had paid money to be there. The players, they had worked hard to organize themselves with registration fees and uniforms, all under the guise of spending this peaceful afternoon in the park playing sports with their friends, and then out of nowhere, a group of urban youth… White people can’t tell how old we are. A group of urban youth… Some rowdy eighth graders showed up and just started yelling weird, mushroom-y shit at them. Stuff that didn’t even make sense. I was sitting on a bench like, “Hey! Number three!” “You remember Bob Dole?” “You know Bob Dole? He was a politician, ’80s, ’90s, ran for president, never won.” “You remember Bob Dole?” “Remember he had that weird, fucked-up arm? Little arm.” “He had to keep a pen in it so nobody’d notice how mangled his little hand was.” “Remember Bob Dole?” “Well, you throw like Bob Dole!” “Fuck you, number three!” “Bob-Dole-throwing motherfucker.”', 'This was the best part of the afternoon. At one point, at one point, the, um… the… the… the left fielder… and I guess I’m cautious to call him a left fielder because he was very clearly an office manager, you know what I mean? He wasn’t left field by trade. But the office manager in left field, he missed an easy pop fly, right? Easy pop fly goes over his head. He falls down. Super embarrassing moment. And then I took it upon myself. I stood up in front of everybody at the park. I stood up and I shouted, “Hey!” “I’m not angry, but your mother and I are very disappointed.”', 'I shouted that in front of everybody. And what y’all have to understand is that that joke did fine here. Fine. Y’all are cool. But at the park? I fucking killed. You know what I mean? Y’all are okay, but at the park, I goddamn destroyed. Me and my friends, we were high-fiving and shit. Jogging bitches, they stopped. They were laughing. The Mexican man with the popsicles, he winked at me. Gave me a free Snoopy. Destroyed, right? But here’s what you also have to understand, is that when I said that, I was on mushrooms. Right? I was as high as the day is long. So when I said that, and me and this person in left field made eye contact, there was a brief moment where I was his father. You understand? I was this 40-year-old white man’s dad. And I’ll be honest, I was disappointed. Because this isn’t the life that I imagined for my white son. Maybe that’s good enough for your white boys, but not mine. No, sir, his mother and I had worked too hard, too hard, to give him a life he didn’t even earn. We paid off the DUI. We bribed the college admissions offices. We introduced him to people named Humphrey. And all we ever asked of him was that he not shame us. Don’t embarrass us in this public way. And I got so angry, so in my head rageful at what my son was doing, that out of nowhere, I shouted. I shouted in front of everybody, “Hey!” “I’m selling the house in the Berkshires and I’m cutting you out of the trust.” And then no one laughed, ’cause no one knew what the fuck I was talking about. Mexican man took back his popsicle. “Gimme that shit.” “Thought you were funny. You’re weird.” “You’re a weird guy at the park.”', 'Best thing. You’re telling me I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to my parents? You? You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to your parents? Most of us still get embarrassed when we have to read out loud. The other day, I was reading my daughter a bedtime story, and I ran into the word “pterodactyl.” Fucked up my whole evening. I was just sitting there like, “What the fuck… is a ‘peterodasatill’?” See, see, see, this is the government trying to put the names of prescription drug medications in our children’s books! They trying to get my baby hooked on this shit. They trying to make my daughter a petero-head. Can’t be the best thing, man. There’s so much I’m dumb about, so much I don’t understand in the world. Okay, great example. Let’s talk about this. As it relates to COVID, right? Specifically the COVID vaccine. Am I the only person, am I the only one in this room, who thought Walgreens would have a separate staff? You know, like for the medical interventions. I thought there’d be, like, Walgreens doctors. And Walgreens nurses. It’s not. It’s the same n*ggas. It’s the same people who sell you batteries. Some of y’all don’t get it. Listen. Hey. Hey. The key for the deodorant and the key for the Moderna? It’s on the same ring. It’s just one dude being like, “Whatcha need, player? Yeah, I got you.” “Oh, Pfizer? Nah, I can’t get you the Pfizer.” “Gotta call the manager for the Pfizer.” “You want that Johnson & Johnson, I get you that right now.” “We keep that with the Hot Pockets. I can get you Johnson & Johnson.” “But Pfizer, we gotta call the manager. He got the big key.” “Also, please fill out this form, because I am now your primary care physician.” “We gon’ change up your diet. You eating string cheese.” “It’s on sale.” Can’t be the best thing, man. I still get hard when I ain’t supposed to be hard. Know what I mean? That’s not a threat. I don’t like how you’re looking. That’s not… I’m not threatening you. You enjoy your evening. I’m saying I get boners when I didn’t expect… to have a boner. Like when I’m waiting for the train. Everybody be looking at me like, “Damn, he really loves the train.” But I don’t. I’m not a train guy. I’m not. I just can’t help it. I… And I used to think it was just a me thing, you know? I used to think I was the only person hard in my local Chipotle. But after years of careful research, I’ve come to discover it’s not just a me thing. In fact, every dude in here has the exact same problem. Ladies, whether he’s ready to admit it or not, every dude has found himself at work, just in a marketing meeting, with a throbbing erection he can’t explain. Just avoiding pie charts, ’cause those are making it worse somehow. Like, “Oh God, are we at 98%?” “Lord.” “I’m about to bust. I can’t.” “I pray to God they don’t push that pie chart next to another pie chart, ’cause that’s titties, and I’mma cum.” “I’mma cum from that pie booty.” We can’t control our bodies. That’s why I don’t listen to anything men have to say about reproductive responsibility and the women…', 'No. ‘Cause we be hard.', '[audience cheers]', 'We be hard, and if you got a hard dick, you should maybe tuck it in your belt and shut the fuck up. I’m not trying to hear your hard-dick opinion. You can’t be erect and correct at the same time. Thank you. Hey, I’mma run for president. I’mma be up there giving speeches, hard as hell. Like, “Damn, Putin got them big bombs, don’t he? Shit!” “Putin bombs look like titties. Fuck!” “Big ol’ titty bombs.”', \"I think I just have fear about what it means to raise a child, you know? To bring a person to their greatest potential, that’s scary. Fear, honestly, that existed throughout my wife’s entire pregnancy. Terrified, genuinely afraid. The entire time, I was terrified I was gonna end up with a white baby. Terrified. And I’ll explain it. It’s not as confusing as you think it is. I’m biracial, right? My mother’s Black, my father is white. My wife is the exact same mix. So… if I’m half-white, and she’s half-white, and recessive genes kick in, we could end up with a fucking daywalker. A little surprise white baby! Just a little tampon-colored Tyler, with varicose veins. Talking ’bout, “Daddy, I’m in the mood for poached eggs.” Ew! I don’t want a white baby! I don’t want a baby that ages like a Gypsy curse. Why does this baby look older than me? I hate it. Hate this white baby. And I don’t have anything against white people. I don’t. Honestly, I’m a big fan of your work. I really am. Rollerblades? Y’all did that. Don’t let anybody tell you you ain’t make rollerblades. Y’all are the reason we shred. Like I said, man, my father’s white, so I… Okay, this is the best way. This is it. Okay. It… Here it is. It’s hard to blame the white man for all of your problems when the white man still pays your cell phone bill. I’m on the devil’s family plan. I can’t… I can’t be that… You know what I mean? I can’t be up here like… [emphatically] “Brothers and sisters!” “I said, brothers and sisters, and maybe even Vin Diesel.” “It’s hard to tell with him. What color is that exactly?” “Periwinkle?” “Looking like a old-ass cauliflower.” “Anyway, we must overthrow the white man.” “We must bring every single white person to justice, except for the white people who send me money on my birthday.” “Also, the entire cast of The Office.” “They are hilarious.” “And whichever white person invented fruit on the bottom of yogurt.” “I tried it, I love it.” “I love it. The other day, I ate a boysenberry flavor.” “I took a good, healthy poop, and I thought, ‘Oh, this is why white people act like that.'” “Too much power. I feel too strong.” “I want to open a private prison and use a neti pot. I love it!” “Take my shoes off on a plane. I love it.” “Feels good.”\", 'Fear. Know what my biggest fear is with a kid? Genuinely, this is my biggest fear, is how do you make your kid into a good person? Do you know what I mean? If you have kids, if you’re a parent, and I think we can all agree on this, you’re just guessing. All of us. You’re… We plug in a formula. We plug in the exact same formula. You teach ’em to share, you give them motherfuckers vegetables and shit, and then you just hope. You just hope your kid doesn’t into, like, a serial killer. Or even worse, one of those people who draws Lion King characters with human titties. You remember those psychopaths in school? Those future Republican senators? Any cartoon titty kids here tonight? Anybody want to fess up to what they did? Nobody ever raises their hand, but statistically, that can’t be correct. The math don’t check out, ’cause every class I was in, I’d look over and some kid was disgracing the Disney corporation. And let’s be clear, ladies and gentlemen, That’s not what Walt Disney wanted. Walt… Walter Disney… Walt Disney wanted good, wholesome content. Also, to exterminate the Jews. He wanted dead Jews And good family-friendly content. And now you look over and some kid is drawing Zazu, just the bird from Lion King, with big, heavy lunch lady titties. Big casserole and spatula titties. Now the bird can’t fly. Talking about, “Simba, I can’t help you become king. My back hurts.” “What god would make me like this, Simba?” “Kill me.”', 'How do you make them good? This is a… This is a weird transition after that titty joke, but… I used to be a high school teacher. That’s what I did before comedy. I taught 9th, 11th and 12th grade English. I’m the reason your kid pronounces it “liberry.” I coulda helped. I chose not to. I wanted to see them flail. Teaching’s tough, man. It… You… This is what made teaching so difficult for me, is that no matter how challenging a kid is, right, no matter how difficult a kid is, you have to maintain this hope, this faith, that they can still grow into better people. Right? That they can still find the best version of themselves. And that’s so hard, because so many kids deserve to be pepper sprayed. Right? They deserve to be Maced. In their fucking eyeballs. Until they learn to contribute to society. Some of the meanest things ever said to me came from children. Not my enemies. Little unwashed people. Motherfuckers who don’t wipe so good. This is the meanest thing anyone’s ever said to me. I had a little girl raise her hand, middle of class. She raised her hand to tell me she didn’t think I could ever become a professional male model, because I have too much adult acne. You understand? She interrupted class to tell me… Keep in mind, I wasn’t trying to be a male model. At all. I wasn’t doing nothing sexy. I was trying to teach this bitch to read. But something so hateful in her spirit saw me up there trying my best, and she thought to herself… [flatly] “Uh-uh.” “Uh-uh. No way. Uh-uh. Fuck that.

I want to stab Edna in the stomach, right? I wanna knife her up real good in the belly, and then afterward, I want to stuff the wound with Hot Cheetos so she’d die all spicy and shit. Fucking hate Edna. Edna’s the reason I stopped writing poetry. You understand? She stole the magic of verse from me. Let me be clear, this wasn’t my original dream. I didn’t want to perform behind a bar, you know what I mean? I wanted to be a poet. I was… Oh, man. I’m telling you, I was going to be a poet. I… Y’all, I… I was gonna write silky metaphors. I was gonna wear a thick tweed jacket. I was going to go down on weird ladies with hairy armpits. I was going to be a poet. And then I had to teach an after-school poetry program for Edna’s class. And every day, for eight consecutive weeks, that little girl hurt my feelings. She made me sad for two lunar cycles, and now I want her dead. This was a poetry class. And this is where I messed up. This was my mistake. I’m going to admit that up top. This is where I messed up. I thought the best way to get these kids to write their poems was for me to share one of my own. Right? Huge mis… Right. Yeah. I get it. I fucked up. I should have just read them Tupac lyrics like my teachers did for me. “Listen up, kids.” First off, fuck yo’ bitch And the clique you claim “That’s called a stanza.”', 'Even worse, the poem that I read them was a poem that meant a lot to me at the time. It was a poem about a friend of mine who died in a car crash. This girl I know who died in a car crash. And in the poem, I do all this metaphorical work to compare her death to the death of a spider I found in my windowsill. And the final lines of the poem go… The exact final lines of the poem go, How close to God this spider must feel Weaving a world above the earth The string as thin as breath The breath so easily silenced A net of wings Fluttering toward blind quiet Before I could even finish, before anyone even had a chance to process the words coming out of my mouth, Edna just went, “Damn! This poetry n*gga’s gay as hell.” [tightly restrained seething] Fucking bitch. I oughta kill this stupid little bitch. [angrily muttering] I’ll punch you in the head, stupid bitch. Punch you dead in your fucking face. Kids break you. They break the person you thought you were going to be, and then we subsequently break them, and it becomes this ugly cycle of broken people. This is a great example of what I mean. Years ago, I read this article about a teacher in Idaho, right? Teacher in Idaho who got fired from his job, he got arrested, he got taken to jail, because he brought a puppy to school to show his class. Right? Seems harmless enough. He brought a puppy to the school. He showed the puppy to his students. And then afterwards, he fed that puppy to the class’s pet snapping turtle.', '[audience winces, groans]', 'Everybody okay?

And I kept thinking, “Man…” “Fuck those kids.” “Fuck them.” What kind of permanent damage did those kids do to him? ‘Cause he wasn’t like that at the beginning of the year. He didn’t start off that way. That wasn’t written in the syllabus. They broke him! They broke his brain. They taunted him and they teased him and they took pictures of his paycheck and they posted it on the internet.

Love, you know, the thing that Flavor Flav and Brigitte Nielsen have. They say that’s how you make a good person. I don’t know if I believe in that. I don’t know if I still believe in love, honestly. I just found out that my wife thinks that I’m special needs. And yes, she means it in a derogatory way. She’s a bad lady. She should go to jail. Lock her up. The other day, she called me from work and she said this to me, verbatim. Verbatim, this is what she said to me. Now, keep in mind, I have changed some of the words to make me sound better and her sound worse. But verbatim, this is what she said to me. She called me up and she said, “Hey, I’m making chili tonight, and I need you to heat up a can of beans.” Then she said, and I’ll never forget it, “And whatever you do, don’t put the can in the microwave.”', \"You understand? She told me, her emergency contact, not to put a can… And when she said that, I took a deep breath. You know? I took a deep breath, and I really thought about all the time we’ve spent together. The love that we’ve shared, the bond that we’ve built. I took a deep breath, and then finally, very calmly, I said… I said… I said, “Bitch, I’ll fucking kill you.” “I will kill you dead.” “I will take that gun that we bought after white people tried to take back the country from other white people, and I will shoot you in the leg.” “Is that what you think of me?” “That I’m metal-in-a-microwave stupid?” “You let me cum inside of you.” “You let that cum become a person.” “You leave me alone for hours, completely unsupervised, with that cum.” “Not to mention all those loose cans of beans.” And this whole time, she just been thinking, “Damn. I bet some day he gon’ kill himself with a microwave.” “I bet some day, he gon’ put a can of SpaghettiOs in the microwave, push the popcorn button, and blow his fucking face off.” “And then our daughter’s gonna have to grow up in a world where people refer to her dumbass daddy as ‘Orville Deadenbacher.'” It’s a long way for a pun.

Four different husbands, and sometimes I think my mom’s the only person who’s truly figured love out. You know what I mean? She’s the only person who figured out what love is supposed to be. Because while the rest of us have potentially wasted our lives trying to find some perfect, special someone who may not even exist, instead my mom gets married every El Niño. She finds a new husband every other Toyotathon, and she just be having fun out there. She’ll marry anybody. Old-ass karate students. Grown men who order apple juice at restaurants. At one point, I’m not making this up, my mom married a disgraced NBA mascot. Yeah, that’s not a Mad Lib, that’s a choice she made. In front of God and the government. And all right, let’s just start from the beginning. I’ll walk you… You have questions, I have answers. First of all, did you know that NBA mascots could be disgraced? No? Even worse. Did you know these disgraced motherfuckers could fuck your mom? Apparently, it could happen to any of us.

And the next question you’re naturally asking… You want to know how did he lose his job as Benny the Bull, right? How does one lose such a coveted position as Chicago mascot Benny the Bull? I’ll tell you. He was fired from his job as Benny the Bull because, and I’m not making this up, in 2004, he got caught selling drugs after a game in full costume. Just standing in the parking lot. Even the police walked up like, “Benny, what are you doing?” “Those are your work clothes!” He was arrested, he was banned from the stadium for life, and my personal favorite detail, they added his name to the Wikipedia page.

I don’t… There is no good and bad. It’s not just good and bad. It’s not just right and wrong. It’s not just dark-skinned Sammy Sosa and Hello-Kitty-colored Sammy Sosa. There are so many different shades of Sammy Sosa in-between. My personal favorite, tapioca Sosa. Good and bad, that’s all bullshit. This is a great example.

She got all them nuggets everywhere. She kept this box of Chicken McNuggets, and on the day of that sixth year, the day that six years hit, she opened that box, she looked inside.

Maybe all of this is a fallacy. Maybe all these suggestions of eternity and everlasting are bullshit. Maybe we should just be eating what we want, and microwaving cans. And jerking off to the green M&M. Do you know what I mean? Just beating our meat to the green one, ’cause she got eyelashes and we like that. I don’t care if you take her boots away. She’s still got them eyelashes. Let me see them eyelashes! You know what I like. Maybe the only forever we can guarantee is Chicken McNuggets. Then I thought to myself, “Holy shit.” “I shoulda got my dick sucked by that McDonald’s lady.” Because maybe the preservatives in her mouth would’ve transferred onto my penis and made my nuggets last forever.

If the traffic stops short, the dad hand to the passenger eye, ear, nose, and throat area—just smacking you right in the face. Still doing it to his grown son. Because the windshield, the seatbelt—these things won’t save me, but his scrawny 75-year-old arm—a little karate chop to the throat—it’s not going to work. And I’ll tell you why: because his reaction time is slow. It’s a little off schedule. So whatever happened, he’s not kicking in for quite a while. And then, out of nowhere—”Hey, Dad, whoa, we’re sitting on the couch! What are you doing? We got home 15 minutes ago.”', 'He’s making me nervous because he just had a little fender bender. I think it was his fault—he hit a parked car. It was parked in his driveway. And it was my car. Watched the whole thing happen through the living room window. I heard him revving up in the garage—I’d never seen him drive that fast—just bam! Eight feet, full speed, into the side of my car. And I ran. I said, “Oh wow, are you all right?” I couldn’t believe I had to ask this. I said, “Didn’t you see my car was there?” And he got mad at me. My father said, “Well, your car’s not usually there when I back out.” I said, “Hey, Dad, let’s not drive from memory. The world is changing; it’s changing all the time.”', 'And my mother’s worse because my mother’s shrinking. That’s what happens to Italian people as we get older—we just keep getting smaller and smaller. I saw it happen to my grandparents—they turned into little Italian salt and pepper shakers. You could hold them; it’s like a Disney movie.', 'So my mother is shrinking, and she drives looking through the steering wheel like she’s holding a hula hoop in her hands. That’s not safe. The other drivers don’t even know she’s in there—they just see the haunted Honda drifting through traffic.', 'So here’s what I want to do: I want to get Mom one of those big wooden ship’s wheels—you know, the ones with the knobs—and that way, we can stick it in the middle of the dash, and she can drive standing up like a pirate. Let’s put a parrot on her shoulder. “Arrr, I’ll be going to the deli, who’s coming with me?”', 'It’s good to visit with them, though. I forgot that my dad is one of the all-time great throat-clearers. Sounds like he’s got a big announcement coming up—a lot of that “ahem” we used to do when we were kids. Oh, we’d hear my dad in the bathroom every morning, tuning up. He’d like to start every morning with 20 minutes of this:', '[Makes exaggerated throat-clearing sounds]', 'Like, you could tell he couldn’t get under it, so he had to come at it from different angles. You’d think, “What are you trying to knock loose at 8 o’clock in the morning? Did you swallow a pine cone overnight?”', 'My sister and I would laugh; my mother would yell, “Don’t make fun of your father!” And then she’d yell at him, “Frank, stop it!” He couldn’t even defend himself yet. I wouldn’t have laughed if I knew it was hereditary. I got the gene. I got the throat-clearing gene. It’s terrifying.', 'Oh man, and like I said, I’m trying to date—try dating younger women. That’s a mistake. Every man thinks he can get away with it because we’re so delusional. Every man thinks he’s just a bathrobe away from being Hugh Hefner.', 'I tried going out on a date with a woman quite a bit younger than me, and I’ll give you some advice. If you’re on a date with someone who’s 20 years younger, when your food comes out, don’t take out your vitamins. Doesn’t look cool. And I have the tray with the compartments—she’d never seen it. She thought it was a harmonica. Now, I have to walk her through everything. “Well, these are my fish oil capsules, so I apologize if we’re kissing and there’s a weird burp. This is my glucosamine-chondroitin blend, which explains the crunching noise my knees made when we sat down. These three are stuck together, but I’m taking them anyway. And this is a dime I was about to swallow, so I’m glad we caught that in time.”', 'I’m trying to stay healthy. I’m back at the gym. I am so sore right now. How long are you supposed to rest between workouts? Because it was six years. I felt like that should be enough time.', 'I can’t recover! I can’t. And I know it. I went into my gym, and they put up these motivational posters to frighten you into having a good workout. And they put up a new one by the squat rack that said, “Go heavy or go home.” So I went heavy. Should’ve gone home. I went to do my squats—I went all the way down, and I remained there. I couldn’t get back up. I had to crawl out from under the bar. The guys at the gym saw me, and there are things you want to hear those guys say—things like, “You got it!” or “Nice work!” You don’t want to hear things like, “Are you okay, sir?” or “Do you need us to call someone?” or “Are you wearing a special bracelet, sir? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?” Of course, right next to me, some big gorilla in the next squat rack had 600 pounds on the bar. He looked at me and said, “Can you give me a spot?” I don’t like how you laughed at that already. I told him, “I don’t even think I could slow that down if something went wrong.” I said, “The best I can do is try and talk you out of it.” And I did. He went home. We actually left and got something to eat.', 'But the way your body turns on you—man, I went to get my teeth cleaned. I thought I was going to be in and out in a couple of minutes, no problem. They wouldn’t let me leave. First, the dentist and her assistant—whatever they call them, their little henchwoman—they come in with this tray of tools like I’m in a muffler shop. She’s working in my mouth, poking and scraping and jabbing and sticking all these things in there. And then, when she’s done, she said, “I noticed a little bleeding in your gums. Have you noticed any bleeding recently?” I said, “How recently do you mean? Because everything was fine when I came in before you started stabbing me in the face with that little ice pick!”', 'I have a tooth that’s moving around right up front. Anyone here under 40, you have that to look forward to. One day, a random tooth will say, “Oh, time to take a trip around your face!” Right there. The dentist saw that and said, “I noticed you have a little crowding.” That’s what she called it—crowding, like my face is a bus stop. “Notice you have a little crowding. Have you ever thought about braces?”', '“Yeah, I thought about them all the time when I had them! I was 12 years old!” “Well, you’re going to need braces again.” Again! Twice in one lifetime? No. I refuse to be balding and have a retainer at the same time. Braces? “Ooh, do they come with some acne and a Def Leppard T-shirt so I can relive the ’80s?”', 'Her next question—I thought she was messing with me—straight-faced, the dentist said, “Do you grind your teeth when you’re asleep?” “Oh, I’ll have to check the overnight tooth cam.”', 'So, I grind my teeth. The dentist said I need a mouth guard. If you don’t know what a mouth guard is, for a mere $800, they’ll make a custom-fit orthodontic device the size of a horseshoe, which I will cram into my face every evening to keep me from chewing on myself.', 'And won’t that be a hit with the ladies? “I’m so glad you could spend the night. Just give me one moment here… [Mimics putting in a mouth guard] …so I don’t claw your eyes out while you have breakfast.”', 'What woman wants to wake up next to Hannibal Lecter? I said, “I’m not spending $800 on a mouth guard. It would be cheaper to just put a wad of cash in my mouth every night and gnaw on that.”', 'Then it occurred to me—I thought, “You know, I could probably find a better deal online.” And I did. I went to Amazon. Instead of one mouth guard for $800, I got a pack of 12 for $3.45.', 'So, before I went to sleep, I put that flimsy, mail-order mouth guard in my mouth. And I don’t know if it worked because when I woke up, it was gone. I don’t know if I swallowed it, maybe it’s under the bed, I don’t know. And I don’t care. I got 11 more to go, baby. Amazon Prime’s free shipping—I’ll put the whole box in my mouth, I don’t care, I’m making money on this!', 'Then the final insult—my dentist tells me I have acid reflux. My dentist! It turns out that at night, while I’m asleep, the stomach acid refluxes. I guess first it fluxes, and it thinks that’s pretty cool, and then it refluxes over and over. Thanks to the acid reflux, I’m eroding my teeth from the back. But the good news is, with the grinding, I’m eroding my teeth from the front. So, according to my dentist, within two years, I will have eaten and digested my entire head. By the year 2025, I’ll just be shoes with glasses—that’s all that’ll be left. I will have dissolved my entire body and slept through the whole thing.', 'It sounds—I know the young people here, they can’t comprehend what I’m telling them, but it’s the truth. Listen, you look like you’re on a field trip. How old are you? 28? You’ve got two years left to do anything interesting. You want to do anything crazy, you’ve got to do it before you’re 30. So if you want to do any bungee jumping or getting out of a chair too fast, you’ve got to do that now, okay? They hate you so much. Thank you so much, you’re young.', 'We could cut your arm off, and it would grow back like a starfish. You have no idea the power you have—it’s annoying. Anybody under 40 gives me their opinion, I say two words: “You’ll see.”', 'Someone in their 20s—I can barely hear what you’re saying. I look at you, and all I see are stem cells. I can just melt you down and inject you into my ankle.', 'Oh man. So, I still get a lot of pressure from my family to settle down. I feel bad—my poor father took me aside. He said, “You know, your mother and I really want grandkids.” And I said, “Well, then you’d better get cracking!”', 'But the guilt trip is real. I went to visit my family, and my mother and father cornered me, yelling at me—I’m a grown man—and the two of them are freaking out: “Joseph, you need a plan! You don’t have any children! Who’s going to take care of you when you get old?”', 'That’s when it hit me—they think I’m going to take care of them!', 'Now, who needs a plan?', 'I’d like to have kids one day, but just for the one day because they’re very annoying—constant demands: “Clothe me, feed me, let me sleep inside.” When does it end?', 'But some people have cool kids. This is so awesome—a friend of mine just had a baby. The kid’s got an extra finger on one hand. I’m delighted, I’m so thrilled, and no one else wants to talk about it. It’s a friend of the family, and I found out because my mother left a voice message—a strange message: “Judy just had a beautiful baby girl, but she has six fingers on one hand. Don’t say anything.” Click.', 'So I called back, and I said, “Well, the finger’s on the kid’s hand, right?” “Yeah, of course.” “Well, not if the finger’s coming out of her forehead! We’ve got some issues, right? Unless she has glasses—it’s kind of convenient, then.”', 'See, I look on the bright side. I don’t mean to offend any unicorn people out here, but on the hand, it’s much better to have that extra finger. So I went to see the baby, and when I walked in, people took me aside and said, “Just don’t draw any attention to the extra finger.” And I said, “Yeah, that’s the only reason I’m here! You think I just come to see people’s babies? What are you, crazy?”', 'I’m delighted! I say, “Get that kid a guitar. Think about it—this could be the next Eddie Van Halen right here. It’s extra—it’s bonus.” You’ve never heard that before—dun dun dun dun—wow! You’ll hear that and think, “Well, we’ve heard dun dun dun dun before, but dun dun dun dun—that’s a whole new sound. That’s a hit record right there. Keep it in there.”', 'So I took those parents aside, and I said, “Listen, don’t listen to these other people, okay? No one’s going to make fun of your kid. You tell them it’s a blessing to have that beautiful, healthy, little six-fingered freaky baby there—that is a gift, okay? That is good luck. And I’ll tell you why—because that kid’s going to win every argument that starts with ‘first of all,’ because you don’t know she’s got one in the chamber. She’s got an extra—she’s got reinforcements. So you’ll make your big discussion and your argument and your points—you think you’ve got it all wrapped up, and then suddenly, out of nowhere, she hits you with, ‘And in conclusion…’ I think you win again, six-fingered baby.”', 'You guys have been a delight. My name is Joe DeVito—thank you so much!'], ['Joe Rogan, performing live in San Antonio, expresses his love for Texas, recounts his move there, and makes humorous observations about Texas weed, Buc-ee’s gas stations, and aliens.

Rogan also shares his thoughts on societal changes, the complexities of language, and the absurdity of certain behaviors and beliefs. Throughout, he maintains a comedic, irreverent tone, engaging the audience with his unique blend of humor and provocative insights.', '* * *', '[announcer] And now, live from San Antonio, this is Joe Rogan.', '[audience cheering and applauding]', 'What’s up? What’s happening? San Antonio! The world got weird, but we’re all together.', '[audience cheering and applauding]', 'We’re all together. And I wouldn’t wanna be anywhere else but here in Texas. Fuck, yeah. [audience cheers] Fuck, yeah. Thanks for coming out, folks. Thank you very much, appreciate it. [audience cheers] This is my new home state. I’ve been living here for four years, I fucking love it. [audience cheers] I love it here. I’m never moving. The only adjustment I’ve ever had to make is Texas weed. [audience laughs] You think it’s the same. Texas weed is different. Because Texas weed is grown on Texas soil. [audience cheers] And I believe the soil has memories. [audience laughs] Because if you smoke too much Texas weed, like… [inhales] We gotta give this land back. [audience laughs] Dude, what the fuck did they do? [audience laughs] I heard that every Buc-ee’s is built on an Indian burial ground.', '[audience laughs]', 'Yeah. [laughs] That might be misinformation. Don’t say you heard it from me. I am known for that shit. [audience laughs] Buc-ee’s is where I take all my friends from California. They’re like, “Why do you like Texas?” I take them right to Buc-ee’s. “Behold!” [audience cheers] Behold the kind of gas station possible in the land of the people who conquered the Comanche. If you’ve never been to Buc-ee’s, it’s like if you were in the middle of a cocaine binge and you decide to make the ultimate gas station. And you fucking did it. [audience laughs] You really did it. You got a pile of your dad’s oil money, like… [snorts] [man] Whoo! “I wanna sell kayaks!” [audience laughs] I want my gas station now, pickled alligator dicks and Chuck Norris action jeans.', '[man] Woo-hoo!', '[snorts] How come you can’t vote here? [audience laughs] If you could vote for Trump at Buc-ee’s, the aliens would land. They would go, “What the fuck are you people doing?” I’m very invested in aliens being real. If they’re not, I’m gonna feel so fucking stupid. I’ve had so many dumb conversations about them. The dumbest argument that aliens aren’t real, “If aliens are real, why don’t they land on the White House lawn?” Oh, when you go fishing, do you check in with the president of the lake? [audience laughs] No, you just trick those dummies with fake food and pull them up, take pictures of them, drop them back in the water, and they’re like, “What the fuck just happened?” [audience laughs and applauds] Exact same things the aliens do to us. I think aliens look at us the same way we look at Waffle House fights. [audience laughs] They just observe, like, “What the fuck is going on?” If you could come from another planet, you think you’d wanna talk to Biden? [audience laughs] Like, “Take me to your leader.” “I got hairy legs. My uncle got eaten by a cannibal. [audience laughs] Come on, man.”', '[audience cheering and applauding]', 'I think… [laughs] I think if I was an alien, I would treat us the exact same way the aliens do. I wouldn’t give a fuck who’s in the Pentagon. I would find some dude cooking meth in Arkansas, and I’d teleport him up into the spaceship and explain to him telepathically that time is an illusion, even though you can measure it, and all humans are the product of accelerated evolution put here to give birth to A.I. Then I’d drop him back off in the woods. [audience laughs] And say, “Now go tell someone, bitch. [audience laughs] Go tell them how I touched your butt.” [audience laughs] What? What’s that all about? The alien anal probe, we all know. Why do we know that? Why is that always a part of the story? Because it makes the story more ridiculous. Makes people less likely to believe. I think they’re going, “What if somebody believes him? Put something in his ass. [audience laughs] Make him love it. Make him just jizz all over himself.” Just, “Oh, shit. Oh, God.” Imagine if you have your greatest orgasm on an operating table in a spaceship? “Oh, Jesus.” [audience laughs] You’re gonna leave that part out. [audience laughs] Your story’s always gonna seem suspect. People gonna go, “Is that all?” “That’s everything. The whole story.” [audience laughing] Maybe that’s how they get our DNA. That’s how they get cum out of donkeys. [audience laughs] I used to host Fear Factor, and, uh… [laughs]', '[audience cheering and applauding]', 'And… Thank you very much. Thank you very much. [laughs] This is a true story. Fear Factor was canceled because we made people drink donkey cum. [audience groans] I’m the only guy in Hollywood that lost a job because people had to drink cum. [audience laughs] Usually, that’s how you get a job. [audience laughs] And look, first of all, wasn’t my idea. Okay? I just worked there. And the way Fear Factor would work, I would show up, they’d give me a script of what the contestants had to do. I would read it and go, “What the fuck?” [audience laughs] But on one day in particular, it said they were playing horseshoes to see who had to drink the most donkey cum. And I said words I never thought I’d say. “I don’t think you should make people drink cum on TV.”', '[audience laughs]', 'When I’m the voice of reason, you’ve got a really fucked-up program. [audience laughs and applauds] And here’s the thing, they had buckets, like Home Depot buckets, of cum. And I’m like, “How did you get that?” [audience laughs] You can’t just have that. You gotta tell me how you sourced it, okay? You gotta be real clear right away. We got laws, okay? So I asked the handler, “How do you get it?” He goes, “You take a cattle prod and you stick it up the donkey’s ass and you shock his prostate, and they just bust.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Whoa, that is so fucked up.” Then I was like, “What does that feel like?” [audience laughs] Like, you don’t wanna know. Like, what if it’s your favorite thing? Like… [grunts] You can’t even tell anybody. If that was your favorite thing, you gotta keep that to yourself. No one is gonna understand. They ask you, “What’s the happiest day of your life? Birth of your child?”', 'Like, “Eh.', '[audience laughs] That was pretty good. But one time, I got abducted by aliens. They stuck the finger of God up my ass, and I jizzed out of every cell in my body. And I been chasing that dragon ever since. [audience laughs] I’m on my rooftop every night with a flashlight going: ‘Come back. Come back. Come back’.” [audience cheers and applauds] If they’re real and they’re watching… If they were gonna come, they would have come during COVID. It’s good to see everybody having a good time. The country’s almost back to normal before World War III.', '[laughs]', '[audience laughs and cheers] COVID was just so strange. We lost a lot of people during COVID, and most of them are still alive. [audience laughs]', 'Yeah. Right?', '[audience cheering and applauding] Right? There’s a lot of people that I don’t fuck with anymore. Before COVID, I would have told you vaccines are the most important invention in history. After COVID, I’m like, “I don’t think we went to the moon.” [audience laughs] I think Michelle Obama’s got a dick. I think Pizzagate is real. I think there’s directed-energy weapons in Antarctica. [audience cheering and applauding]', '[man] Oh!', 'I’m just kidding. I’m just kidding. I don’t think Michelle Obama’s got a dick, but I believe all that other shit. [audience laughs] Here’s one thing we found out during COVID. How disgusting men are. Because here’s a pop quiz: how many ladies got fired because they got caught masturbating during Zoom calls? [audience laughs] Was there even one? Out of all the crazy bitches out there, not even one is like, “Show me your fucking spreadsheet.” Not even one? Not even one. [audience laughs] Dudes were dropping like flies. It was the number one reason why men in executive positions got fired. I just made that up, but doesn’t it make sense?', '[audience laughs]', 'You believed me. It tracks. [audience whooping] Men are so gross you can’t even set up in front of a camera with a… With a computer with a webcam pointed at us without a guy thinking, “What does this camera see if I get down like this here? Keep a poker face. If this dog stops barking so I can keep my hard-on.” You’re on an election call, like, “January 6th, lock them up. Lock them all up.” [audience laughs] Here’s the thing about jerking off. Everybody does it, but if you get caught, you’re a fucking loser. [audience laughs and applauds] “You fucking loser.” And you feel it too. You’re like, “Oh, no, I can’t believe I got caught.” “Everyone knows. Everyone’s gonna know. Oh, no!” [sobs] I’ve only been caught once in my whole jerking-off career. But it was by my wife, and she was so upset. She goes, “I can’t believe you did it while I’m at home.” I’m like… [winces] “I do it while you’re sleeping right next to me.” I do it like this. I do tiny strokes just to not wake the master. I put a glass of water on the bed to make sure I’m not making any ripples. I like to live dangerous. I eat supermarket sushi. I don’t give a fuck.', '[audience laughs]', '[man] Whoo!', '[laughs] I like to take fake risks. I like to take edibles before I get on airplanes. [audience cheers] Listen. It’s a way to find out what really bothers you. [audience laughs] I don’t like to give advice. I don’t give a lot of advice. But I will say this. 200mg is the right dose. [audience laughs] Don’t do it. Don’t do it. But if you’re gonna do it, that’s the number. This is why. If you wanna know what’s in the basement, you gotta go down the stairs. [audience laughs] You gotta go look around. A lot of people are like, “I like to microdose. It makes food taste better, makes sex feel better.” Uh-uh. You gotta get to, “What are memories made out of?” You know? You gotta get to, “Maybe the universe is God.” [screams] You gotta get to that place. The airport is the best place to be high in public. This is why. Because no one notices. Because everyone’s acting weird. [audience laughs] No one acts normal at the airport. They’re all standing around, talking quiet. They’re all worried they’re gonna die. When you’re high, you blend right in.', '[audience laughs]', 'And you don’t have to do any thinking. They tell you what to do. “Get in line.” I’m like, “Okay.” [audience laughs] “Walk up here.” [grunts] “Give me your ticket. Sit down. Don’t lean back.” “I won’t. I won’t.” Strap yourself into your chair. And every now and then, they come by with water. You’re like, “Whoa.” [yells] You’re going 500 miles an hour, 30,000 feet in the sky, thinking about people you fingered in high school, going… [audience laughs] And you don’t think you’re gonna make it. “I can’t keep doing this.” But you can. It’s like a near-death experience you always survive. [audience laughs] And all my friends that don’t like weed say the same thing. They’re like, “Dude, it makes me paranoid.” Right. [audience laughs] Right. But when it’s over… But when it’s over. Everyone in this room that has ever been too high, the moment it wears off, you’re like, “Ohhh. I’m gonna be a better person.', '[audience cheering and applauding]', 'I’m gonna be nicer to people. I’m gonna hug more folks. Like, half these problems have to be my fault.” The only time it’s ever been a problem for me is if you have to answer questions to an official person. Like, I have TSA Pre, which I really recommend if you’re not a terrorist. It’s a solid deal. If you give the government money, they let you keep your shoes on. You’re like, “Ah, thank you, overlords. So kind.” And it’s a nice way to separate society. ‘Cause you’re in this quick-moving line. You get to pass those barefoot losers with their shitty paperwork. My laptop’s in my bag, motherfucker. You know? You feel trusted. But I didn’t know that, uh, they still have to touch you even if you have TSA Pre. It’s a number thing. It’s a random number thing. So I walk through the cancer machine, and this light goes off. [audience laughs] And this is exactly how this lady said this to me. She goes: [imitating woman] “You’ve been randomly selected for additional screening.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] And I’m so high, I don’t even know if this is real life. [audience laughs] And I’m like, “But I got the TSA Pre.” She goes: [imitating woman] “Oh, I know. It’s dumb as fuck. But it doesn’t take long, so why are we fighting?” [normal voice] “We’re not fighting. I don’t wanna fight.” [audience laughs] She goes, [imitating woman] “Good. Male assist.” [normal voice] I’m like, “Male assist? Did you just assume my gender?” [audience laughing]', 'Listen.', '[audience cheering and applauding] [laughs] That is a new thing you can say. That’s a new thing you can say, no matter what you look like. If you say to a person, no matter what you look like, if you say: “Did you just assume my gender?” Most people don’t know what to do. [audience laughs] She knew what to do. She goes: [imitating woman] “I’m sorry. Are you a woman, motherfucker?” [audience laughs] [normal voice] And we both looked at each other and went, “Ahhhhhh!” I go, “Oh, you’re high too.” So I high-five this nice lady, and they bring a man who starts touching me while he’s asking me UFC questions. [audience laughs] It’s one of the weirdest moments of my life because, first of all, I’m ticklish and trying to act normal. I’m standing here, and this dude’s on his knee going, “You think Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz ever gonna fight again?” [audience laughs] [audience cheering and applauding] [laughs] And I’m trying to act normal. “I hope so, bro. That’ll be a good fight, solid fight.” Then he hits me with this. If you’ve ever been randomly selected, this is what they do. He goes, “I’ll run the back of my hand against your crotch.” [audience laughs] Remember, I’m really high. [audience laughs] So I’m like, “Why are you gonna use the back of your hand?” [audience laughing and applauding] Is that the best way to do it? Hey, man, is that for you or for me? Because for me, it still feels like you’re touching my dick. You’re just doing it in this weird, dismissive way. Just… [grunts] It’s just a rude way to touch a dick. It’s like… [grunts] “Are you a terrorist? I’ll be the judge. [grunting] Nope. Just another dude whose dick I made feel weird.”', 'I mean…', '[audience laughs] How many terrorists have they stopped with that? Is it zero or is it negative numbers? You disrespectful motherfucker. The back of your hand might be the worst way to figure out something. You ain’t getting no good data. [audience laughs] Why you touching dicks like that? [audience laughs] I tell you why, folks, because it’s our government’s solution to a complex problem. Which is, “How do you touch dicks and not be gay?” [audience laughs] [laughs] They’re like, “Got it. We’re gonna use the back of our hand. It’s no countsies.” [audience laughs and cheers] “Does it work?” “Yeah, try it on me, I can’t even cum. Come on, bro.” [audience laughs] Just jokes, folks, no one’s getting hurt. [audience laughs] I opened up a comedy club in Austin, Texas, a year and a half ago. Thank you very much. [audience cheering and applauding] When the world got crazy, I had to move to the Land of the Free. I love it. But one of the weird things about owning a comedy club is other people’s reactions. Fox News had the dumbest reaction. They’re like, “Joe Rogan created an anti-woke comedy club.”', '[woman] Yeah!', 'I’m like, “Oh, you mean a comedy club?” [audience laughs] Like a regular one? That’s like saying I got a meat-eating steakhouse. You don’t have to use all those words. I get why young people wanna be woke, but I can’t do it, because I come from a different era, okay?', '[audience cheering]', 'I was born In 1967, and when I was a boy, you could be Hitler for Halloween. Nobody cared. I never did it, but you could do It. Show up at your Jewish friend’s house, I’m like, “Aw, look at the little fuhrer.” Give a little tousle of your hair. Throw a candy in your bag. They knew you weren’t really Hitler. Like, he’s dead, and you’re 4. This is ridiculous. [audience laughs] And I get why the young people wanna be woke. I really do. Old people have fucked up the world. Let’s try communism. I get it. You don’t know any better. I get it. You’re young, I get it. And also, people desperately wanna be on a team. We’re tribal. There’s only two teams in this country, the left and the right. You know, you don’t wanna be independent. You don’t wanna be that weird dude telling everybody that gold Is the only legitimate currency and all tax is theft. [audience whooping and applauding]', '[man] Yeah!', 'That’s me. [audience laughs] If you get me drunk, I will be annoying. I will tell some shit you already know. So I understand why people wanna be on a team. So you just try to find a team that aligns with your values, right? What does your team believe? “We believe that healthcare is a basic human right.” I agree. “We think that education should be free.” Me too. “And men can get pregnant.” Fuck! [audience laughs] Is that a package deal? How did that one slip through? [audience laughs] That wasn’t… All of a sudden, it’s an emoji on your phone. You probably don’t even know that you have that. If you’re a heterosexual man… And I know there’s a few of us left. [audience laughs] [audience whooping and applauding] You know… You know how when you type things, Apple gives you an emoji as a suggestion. If your friend’s, like, “Hey, you want to go out Saturday?” You text back, “I can’t. I’m trying to get my wife pregnant, man.” And you look down at your phone, and you’re like, “Is that Bert Kreischer?” [audience laughs] “What is that?” It’s a pregnant man. Oh, finally! Finally, there’s a pregnant man emoji. Representation. Finally, I could write, “eggplant, splash of water, pregnant man.” Finally. You ever see the regular man emoji? He looks like the guy Tiger King fucks in prison. [groans] Just listless and… The pregnant man looks robust, like Charles Bronson with a baby inside him. Like, “I’m the fucking future.” [audience laughs] It’s just new language, okay? I’m trying to learn your new language. I’m willing to say men get pregnant. I’m willing to say “pregnant men.” I just don’t think it’s a good… I think you need extra words. How many men can get pregnant? Not a lot, right? Is there anything different about the ones who can? Maybe we should use extra words, like we do with other stuff, like off-road vehicle. [audience laughs] It’s still a vehicle, but it can do some extra shit. [audience laughs] If you’re a dude and you can have babies, that seems really new. I’m not trying to be offensive. The last person I want mad at me is a pregnant man. [audience laughs and applauds] Do you have any idea how unreasonably confident they would be? You’ve got a full beard and you’re breastfeeding a baby, going, “I am in defiance of God!” [audience laughs] Big old thick neck and hairy tits. And the baby sucking on that nipple going, “Where the fuck is my mom?', '[imitating baby breastfeeding]', '[audience laughs] And why does this taste like jet fuel?” [audience laughs] I wanna know what’s going on. The world got weird. And here’s my take. I just wanna be real clear. I believe in trans people. I think the world is strange, nature is strange. Nature can throw you a curveball, and you believe you’re in the wrong body. And I fully support your right as an adult to do whatever you want that makes you happy. I believe in freedom, and I believe in love. [audience cheering and applauding] But I also believe in crazy people. And here’s the thing. That somehow or another, that got left out of the equation. All of a sudden, crazy people just went away, like the flu during COVID. Like, ah. It just got absorbed in the numbers. Suddenly, every man in a dress is stunning and brave. It’s like… Trans women are women. How about most? How about almost all? You gotta leave room for crazy. Plus, I’m sorry… I’m sorry if it’s taken me a while to adjust, but all my life, if there was a movie about a killer, he was way crazier if he wore a dress. [audience laughs] Psycho. He dresses like his mom. Stabs ladies in the shower. Silence of the Lambs. It puts the lotion in the basket. [audience laughs] Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf was dressed like a fucking lady.', '[audience cheering and applauding]', 'I’m not prejudiced. I like to look at men in dresses like I look at everything else, on an individual basis. Mrs. Doubtfire seems like a lovely human, all right? I’m open-minded. I wanna know what happened. It’s almost like a pervert wizard waved a spell on the whole world. “With a wave of this wand, you can walk to the women’s locker room with a hard cock, and anybody who complains is a Nazi. Abracadabra.” And it just worked. And everyone just accepts this new reality. It’s fucking weird. I just think we need standards. You can’t just put lipstick on and shit in the women’s room. We need some kind of standard. [audience cheering and applauding] [laughs] Oh, my God. All of a sudden it’s a hate rally. I was watching a Roe v. Wade protest where there’s a dude in a dress. It’s a women’s reproductive rights protest, and there’s a guy in a dress with a hairy chest and a five o’clock shadow, and he’s screaming in a cop’s face, “Keep your laws out of my pussy!” [audience laughs] And no one there was like, “What the fuck?”', '[audience laughs]', 'Everyone was like: [imitating woman] “Yeah, stay out of her pussy!” [normal voice] Oh, my God, we’re in Narnia. What is this? That’s a guy! First of all, that’s probably not even a trans person. That’s probably a Republican. [audience laughs] That’s probably an agent provocateur sent in to discredit your organization with ridiculous behavior. Look. [audience cheers and applauds] Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago. Listen. Listen, he’s right about a lot of… He was wrong about that one thing, though. But he’s right… The wrong thing was a big one. But he’s right… That one thing was huge. But he’s often correct. And I’m just saying. If you have a beard and a vagina, you’re a human escape room, okay? I… I don’t have time for puzzles. I’m just trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and how it got everywhere so quick. It’s in prison. In California, there’s 47 biological males that are housed in women’s prisons. A lot of them are sex offenders, but that’s not important. What’s really important is gender. Wouldn’t you think that out of all the places that would be suspicious, that maybe you would be lying? [audience laughs] Fucking jail. Wouldn’t that be at the top of the list? Imagine a woman, “I’m gonna go to prison, but at least I’m gonna be with other women.” You see R. Kelly with a wig on. You’re like, “Fuck.” [audience laughing and cheering] [groans] [audience whistling and applauding] I don’t know what happened. I think it’s China. [audience laughs] I’m only half kidding. I think they got us with TikTok. [audience laughs] I really do. I think they’re just really clever. They’ve been around for 4000… America’s the shit, but we’re real young. We’ve been around 250 years. Who knows if we’re gonna make it. China’s been here for 4000 years. They’ve invented everything. They invented paper, alcohol, gunpowder, rockets, noodles, Kung Fu, and TikTok. [audience laughs] Yeah, and Coronavirus. And I was…', '[audience laughing]', 'I was… Hey, don’t be racist. China. I loved it when Trump would say “China.” [audience laughs] They also invent our phones. The craziest thing. That’s supposed to be our enemy, and they make our phones. Do you know how dumb that is? We let the enemy make our phones. We can’t make a phone. There’s 330 million Americans, plus Mexicans, and no one can make a phone? [audience laughs] “What’s the real number?” “Who cares, are you racist?” “I’m not racist. Let them vote. Give them money.” What’s going on? I don’t think we should have open borders. But maybe some of those folks sneaking in can make a phone. [audience laughs] I mean, some of them have to be valuable. These are ambitious people. If I lived in Guatemala, I’d fucking walk here too. If you can get across the Rio Grande River with a balloon filled with fentanyl stuffed in your ass… [audience laughs] …that’s the type of dude who can get shit done, okay? That guy will come through in a pinch, okay? He’s not gonna form a union. He doesn’t even know what the fuck “overtime” means. [audience laughs] I’ll trade him for everybody who has blue hair. “Fuck you, go back. Go there.” Let’s make America great again.', '[audience cheering]', '[laughs] Oh, this is the silliest show ever. I love it. Thanks for being here. You guys are awesome. This is fun. [audience cheering and applauding] [clears throat] I really am worried about China. I really am.', '[woman shouting]', 'What are you yelling out? Go ahead, yell. You’re on TV.', 'What are you saying?', '[man 1] Hey!', '[man 2] What about the Cobalt…', 'Cobalt mine. Oh, congratulations, you know a thing. This fucking idiot. [mockingly] What about nuclear power plants? What about renewable energy? [normal voice] What a good time to yell that on live TV, fucking dipshit.', '[audience cheering and applauding]', 'Imagine your whole life, “I’m gonna say something meaningful. It’s gonna make an impact. Cobalt mines.” [audience laughs] China does that too. You’re right. They buy our farmland all around military bases. We’re like, “Oh, it’s okay.” The craziest thing they’ve ever done. This is the craziest thing they’ve ever done. There’s a thing called The Bodies Exhibit.', 'Do you know what that is?', '[man whoops] How many of you have been to The Bodies Exhibit?', '[audience whoops]', '[laughs] Okay. If you haven’t been, The Bodies Exhibit is a science museum. It’s a science museum exhibit of dead human beings. They take dead people, skin them, leave their dicks on, give them fake eyeballs and have them posed like doing sports. They’re throwing a javelin, playing poker. It’s the weirdest shit. But somehow or another, it’s okay, because it’s in a museum. If that same scene was in a serial killer’s basement… [audience laughs] If a cop went into a serial killer’s basement and found dead people playing sports, it’d be the front page of every newspaper. Like, what the fuck was that guy doing? Right? But it’s at the museum. And you’re like, “The windows are big. It’s cool.” [audience laughs] I went three times. You should go too. You can’t bring those people back. The last time we were there, we were like, “Why does everybody look Asian?” And we were like, “Where did they get these bodies?” So we Googled it. And you should too. ‘Cause the answer we got is, “Chinese unclaimed bodies which may include political prisoners.” [audience gasps] “May.” When the fuck do you ever get to use the word “may”… [audience laughs] …when people ask you where you got the dead people. What the fuck? Now I’m in the rabbit hole. You know how that goes. “What’s a Chinese unclaimed body?” We Google that. It’s any body left unclaimed for 30 days. Now here’s the problem. This process where they have to turn you into a statue after you’re dead, it has to take place within 48 hours of death. [audience laughs] Thirty days, 48 hours. I’m fucking terrible at math, but I can do that one. How did you guys not do this math? I’m in the museum, like, “This is a fucking murder exhibit.” And part of me is, like, “This is terrible.” And the other part of me is like, “How gangster are the Chinese?”', 'This is…', '[audience laughs] That has gotta be the fucking coolest way to get rid of somebody. Can you imagine some Chinese diplomat comes home, and he catches the tennis instructor in bed with his wife, like: [Asian voice] “Oh, so you enjoy tennis. [audience laughs] Well, now you can play tennis forever!” [normal voice] And he could just go to the museum and visit this dude. Any time he wants. [Asian voice] “Oh, Mr. Big Dick, how’s your game? [audience laughs] You look a little sluggish. I’ll see you tomorrow. Ha-ha. [audience laughs] Ha-ha, motherfucker.” [normal voice] Everybody kills people in other countries, but they don’t turn you into a statue. That’s wild shit. You know, they do it to a lot of people there. You gotta mind your P’s and Q’s in China. You get disrespectful in a business meeting, next thing you know, you’re on a bike at the museum. [Asian voice] “Oh, look, there’s Harry with all his big criticisms about our infrastructure.', '[audience laughs]', 'Look at you now, Harry. Riding a bike like a fucking asshole with your dick hanging out.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] I just wanna say, I admire what they’ve done. I’m not just saying that so I hope they don’t kill me. [audience laughs] I really hope they don’t. But if they did, it would be a funny way for me to die. If I went missing, then four months later there’s a short guy at the museum with a microphone. [Asian voice] “Oh, Mr. Funny Man, where’s your fucked-up accent now? [audience laughs] Go back to Fear Factor. Oh, you can’t. Ha-ha. Ha-ha, motherfucker.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] That would be a funny way for me to die. The funniest way for me to die is if I die from Covid. [audience laughing] Don’t think I didn’t think it! When I got Covid, the first thought I had was, “You better not die. I talked so much shit. I talked so much shit.” If I died from Covid, the memes would never end. [audience laughs] It would be me with two X’s for eyes holding a can of horse paste. “Apparently, fear was a factor.”', '[audience laughs]', 'It would be funny. I would be laughing. I would be on my deathbed going, [laughs] “Fuck. Oh, no. Oh, no. Why didn’t you trust the science?” [audience laughs] [man] Whoo! Why didn’t I trust the science? [audience applauds] Thank you. Nobody likes a science denier. By that, I mean, dudes who believe in squirting. [audience laughs] Like, “Hey, man, they’ve done the research. It’s pee.” “No, dude. I’m telling you, it’s not pee.” “Dude, it’s pee. What are the odds that it’s a mystery fluid that comes out of an undiscovered organ and squirts out the pee hole? Like, hey, at least the Earth looks flat. I can see how you get confused.” [audience laughs] “It looks like pee, it smells like pee, it’s pee.” “Dude, it’s not pee.” “I’m telling you, she’s got a Stanley filled with sweet tea, she drinks it all day and she’s fucking lazy. She doesn’t wanna get up, she’s peeing on you, and you’re a fucking idiot.”', '[audience laughing and applauding]', '“You gotta believe the science. Trust us.” I heard that so often during the fucking pandemic. “Why don’t you trust the science?” I got canceled so often during COVID that sometimes I would find out by accident. [audience laughs] This is a true story. One time, I just woke up, I’m in my underwear, I plopped down in front of the TV, I turn it on. The moment I turn it on, Prince Harry’s talking shit about me. I’m like… [gasps] I just woke up. I’m vulnerable. I’m in my underwear, and there’s a prince on TV. Do you know how fucking weird it is when a prince knows your name? He’s like, [British voice] “Joe Rogan’s giving out dangerous vaccine misinformation.” [audience laughs] And my first thought was, “Fuck, did I? [audience laughs] I might have.” [audience laughs] But here’s my take on that, sincerely. If you’re getting your vaccine advice from me… is that really my fault?', '[audience laughs]', 'Like, who are we protecting? Who’s out there going, “You know that dude who made people eat animal dicks on TV?” “How’s he feel about medicine?” Like… That’s not my job, kids. I’m a professional shit talker, okay? Some of the things I say make sense, a lot of them don’t. It’s up to you to figure out what’s what. That’s the fun part. Problem is, people say, “People listen to you and take your advice.” Well, take this advice: don’t take my advice. It’s the best advice. Don’t take my advice about 200 milligrams, and don’t take my advice about Covid. [audience cheers] Because when my wife had Covid, I fucked her twice. I wish I was lying. It was before any cure. I was following her from seven feet away, like, “You don’t look that sick.” [audience laughs] This is a real conversation we had. She said, “You are gonna catch it.” I go, “No, I’m gonna hold my breath. I can hold my breath for four minutes, let’s fucking go! Let’s fucking go.” I know why people got upset, I got it all. And I’m not even mad at Harry. If I was him, I would have said the same shit, I get it. If I met that dude, I’d love to have a drink with him. I genuinely think most people are good people. I think if you approach them with good intentions, have a good conversation… If I met that dude, I’d be like, “I’m not mad at you. In fact, I think if I lived your life, I would be you, and I think if you lived my life, you would be me. I think we’re all one. Let’s have a drink, relax. Have cocktails, have a good time.” Like most of us, right? [audience cheering] And the goal… The goal would be to get him about three drinks deep. And then go, “Hey, man, you ever do mushrooms?”', '[audience laughs]', '[British voice] “I heard they give you brain damage.” [normal voice] “No, that’s government propaganda. Listen… whatever you eat, I’ll eat double. Come on. Let’s go meet the aliens.” Could you imagine doing mushrooms with Prince Harry? Imagine if you could trick that guy into doing mushrooms with you? If you see him chew it and swallow it, you’re like, “Oh, it’s gonna happen.” There’s a moment when you do mushrooms, like 20 minutes after you swallow it… where you know you can’t throw it up anymore. [audience laughs] You know that moment? You’re like, “Oh no, it’s gonna happen.” Can you imagine that moment? You’re sitting criss-cross applesauce, just staring eye to eye with the prince, waiting. [audience cheering] And here’s the thing about mushrooms. Mushrooms take about 40 minutes to kick in… but about 35 minutes in, you hear them coming.', '[audience laughs]', 'Right? Yeah. You hear footsteps in the distance like… [imitating slow footsteps] [takes a deep breath] [loud, droning hum] [audience cheering and applauding] And while Prince Harry’s tripping balls… I’m gonna hover over him and go, “Are you sure vaccines are safe? [audience laughs] Bitch, you’re not a scientist.” It was a weird time for me, Covid. I got in so much trouble. One thing they would do that was sneaky, is that whenever people were mad at me, they would take things that I’ve said drunk, high as fuck… and they would just put it in quotes. Like it’s a well thought-out statement. As if I’m standing in front of a judge, going: “Your Honor, I believe that lesbians lack the proper lower-back muscles to fuck a woman correctly.” [audience laughs] That was a real quote in an article about what a piece of shit I am. [audience laughs] And I read it, and I was like, “First of all, it’s true.” [audience laughs] I wish it wasn’t. I wish it wasn’t. But also, you can’t just put that by itself. Because I didn’t say it by itself. I wouldn’t just declare that. Like what a rude, shitty thing to say for no reason. I only said that as part of a conversation that I didn’t wanna have. Ever have one of those? You’re talking and somebody interrupts. I was at a bar with a friend in New York, we were drinking, having a good time, and there was this particularly aggressive lesbian lady at the bar, Which genuinely, I’m a fan of. I like wild people. She looked like Tom Arnold, had a Patagonia vest on.', 'You know the type.', '[audience laughs] She was doing shots with her girlfriend. They were talking shit. [imitating woman] “Fuck, yeah, bitch!” [normal voice] Doing shots and kissing. Atmosphere! Fun! Yay! It was fun. But then she kept talking to us. Me and my friend are talking. She goes, “Sorry, boys, she only likes girls. And I got my own dick!” And I’m like, well, now we’re in a conversation.', '[audience laughs]', 'Right? So I go, “Where is it?” And she said, “It’s a strap-on.” And I said, “Having a strap-on and thinking it’s a dick is like having a lighter and thinking you’re a dragon.” [audience laughs and cheers] “Plus, everyone knows that lesbians lack the proper lower-back muscles to fuck a woman correctly.” That’s the only time I would ever say that. It would have to be those words in that order, and I feel like if they put all that in that article, people would read it and go, “I see his point. [audience laughs] Yeah. They were just talking shit and she got out of pocket. That’s all it is.” Instead, they try to use that quote as proof that I’m homophobic. And I’m like, oh my God, there is so much better proof. You guys are lazy. Like, that’s all you dug up? First of all, it’s not true. But if you wanna take me out of context,', 'I give you a lot to work with, you know?', '[audience laughs] For the record, I’m not even remotely homophobic. I’m the opposite. I wish I was gay. It looks way easier. You’re hanging out with only guys? No one can get pregnant? No more lies? I wish! And if I was gay, I get to use that F-word again. Oh, how I miss it so.', '[audience laughs and cheers]', 'Oh, how I miss it so! Tony Hinchcliffe can still say it, but you know why. [audience groans] I used to throw that word around like a beach ball at a concert. Just, “Whee!” It was a fun word. Made conversations more festive. It was fun. And rarely did it have anything to do with gay men. But they took it just like they took the fucking rainbow, all right?', '[audience cheers]', 'Because they’re men, and they’re greedy. They’ll tell you, “You shouldn’t wanna say that word. You say that word, you’re a homophobic piece of shit.” Or you’re calling your friend to wish him a happy birthday. [audience laughs] What about the fun way? There’s no gay people on this phone call unless the government’s gay, because you know they listen. There’s only one problem with that word, and that problem is that there are people in the world, although there’s less than there’s ever been, thankfully, there are people in the world that hate gay men. But nobody hates gay women, and that’s why you can say dyke. [audience laughs] You can say dyke at work, they’re like, “I’ll look out for her.” Nobody cares. Nobody even fake gets mad. Nobody hates gay women. In fact, men don’t even think they’re real.', '[audience laughs]', 'Women believe in gay men. If a woman sees two hot guys kiss, she’s like, “They’re gay.” A guy sees two women kiss, he’s like, “Pfft. They think they’re gay. But that’s just ’cause they ain’t got a piece of this sweet dick, kid!” [audience laughs] Every man that has ever lived… you give him three drinks, he thinks he can fix a lesbian. Like, “Dude, I’m the one, I’m fucking Highlander. I got the tools. I can fix her.” And also, for whatever reason, men don’t seem to care if girls have done gay stuff. Again, I’m just a journalist, and I report what I see in the field… and I’ve noticed if you’re talking to men, and they’re being honest… Gentlemen in this room, I want you to imagine, you’re on a date with a woman and she’s the one. If you get lucky, you will find the one. But sometimes you’re not with the one, it doesn’t seem like it’s gonna happen. One bad relationship after another, you’re so frustrated, am I ever gonna find someone I fucking love? And then finally, you’re on a date with the perfect person. She’s so fucking cool, you’re drinking margaritas, you’re imagining having a family together. And she’s like: [imitating woman] “In the interest of full disclosure… I just want you to know that for the last 10 years', 'I was in a relationship with a woman.”', '[man whoops] [normal voice] And you’re like, “Low miles, whoo!” [audience laughs] You call your friends up, “Dude, it’s like a barn find! Yeah, it’s like a ’69 Mustang that was under a tarp. [audience laughs] A lady had it. Yeah, she took it out every couple days and licked it. Look at all the rubber on those tires. Look at the suspension.” [laughs] I don’t know why men think that way, but I know some women get very angry. This lady waited for me after a show to lecture me. She waited for me, she’s like: [imitating woman] “You don’t care if the woman does gay things if you don’t care about the woman.” I’m like, “Okay, Socrates.” Like, what? Why don’t you write that shit down on rocks so people in the future can read it, you fucking imbecile. I hate dumb people that are confident, you know? Also wrong. I hate dumb people that are wrong and confident. Because she’s wrong. Like, I love my wife more than anyone I’ve ever met in my life. She is my favorite person.', '[audience cheers]', 'Thank you.', 'But…', '[audience laughs] If I came home tonight and was like, “Hey, baby, how was your night?” She’s like: [imitating woman] “Fucking Melissa tricked me into licking her pussy.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] I’d be like, “Well… don’t do that a lot.” [audience laughs] I’ll be walking that fine line between creepy and supportive. Like, “If that happens again, make sure I’m there in case that bitch goes crazy.” [audience laughs] [laughs] No women think that way. Zero. No women think that way. People say there’s no difference between men and women, it’s just cultural. [grunts] That seems like… No women think that way. I don’t care how open-minded you are. I don’t care how progressive you are. If you’re a heterosexual married woman… [imitating woman] and you’re at home just reading a book… waiting for my man… [normal voice] And he comes to the door: “You are not gonna fucking believe what happened. [audience laughs] [exhales deeply] [imitating woman] “What? What happened?” [normal voice] “Mike tricked me into sucking his dick again.” [audience laughs] [imitating woman] “How does this keep happening?” [normal voice] “I don’t know, it’s crazy.” [imitating woman] “Okay, what is going on, are you gay?” [normal voice] “No. Mike is just really tricky.” [audience laughs] They’re gonna say that’s a homophobic joke. And I’m gonna say how? Because the gay guy wins. That dumb straight guy keeps sucking his dick. That’s a W for the gays. They wanna tell you you can’t make jokes about them. If you want equal love, you have to have equal jokes. Because that’s how we find out if you’re annoying.', '[audience cheers]', 'Yeah. If we can’t joke around about you, we know you take yourself too seriously. They’re trying to say they’re hateful, it’s hateful. Listen, I don’t hate anybody. I love everyone. And I love gay men. But I think about gay men the same way I think about mountain lions. I’m happy they’re real, but I don’t wanna be surrounded by them. [audience laughs] They’re dudes who fuck dudes. I don’t like my chances, okay? They’re not unicorns, they’re just men who fuck men. And every man who’s ever lived is a shifty cum salesman, okay? All of them, 100%. Especially the ones who say they’re not. Every man who’s ever lived is a foreman of a small, 24-hour sperm factory with a shaky agreement with the union. You got one warehouse, that’s your balls. One delivery truck, that’s your dick, and packages are constantly stacking up. And you’re like, “Hey, we gotta get this product out of here!” [audience laughs] And if your product sucks, you become a male feminist. And these are the facts.', '[audience cheers]', 'That’s what it is. And some of these guys are trying to get rid of gay jizz. It’s normal. [man cheers] They just got the gay gene. I love them. I love everybody. You can’t control your genes. Obviously, it’s a gene thing. You know, we can’t… Like, you ever done a gene test? I did one of those. I found out I’m 57% more Neanderthal than regular people. [audience laughs] Yeah, I’m fucking handicapped. Yeah, Europeans killed my people too, where the fuck’s my casino? Huh?', '[audience laughs]', 'I want my cave back! That was a big number. I showed my wife. “I told you this wasn’t regular stupid.” [audience laughs] But she had a really good point. She goes: “But all people came from cave people, right?” Which is a fucked-up thing to think, that everyone in this room is here because somewhere in our ancestry, someone had sex before they figured out doors. That was a long time! Thousands and thousands of years, no doors. Just wild monkey people trying to run away from cats. This thing we’re doing right now, this is so recent. Civilized society where a bunch of cool people can hang out together, we don’t know each other, have a wonderful time, drink cocktails.', 'This is so recent.', '[audience cheers] But there’s such a thin veneer on this society. That’s why you have those thoughts. You know those thoughts? “I can’t believe I’m thinking that, I would never do that.” How about this? I know you have this thought. When you’re in your car and the light turns green but the scooters keep coming? [audience laughs] And you just wanna go to jail! I wanna see masks fly off, and backpacks. “Fuck you for feeling safe!” You know those thoughts? You don’t do it, but you know those thoughts? How about this? You ever be in line at Starbucks, and there’s a cop in front of you, and he’s not paying attention?', '[audience laughs]', 'And you’re like, “I think I can take his gun. I’m gonna hit him now and John Wick the fuck out of this room.” You don’t do it, but you think it. That’s why we need homeowners associations, IRS payments, student loans, credit card debt. We gotta be distracted. We can’t keep society going with those thoughts. I have my most fucked-up thoughts talking to really smart people. Because I can’t keep up, so I just start thinking my own things. [audience laughs] “I bet they’re not thinking this.” Because, like, I’m friends with Elon Musk, which is the intellectual equivalent of a boy and his dog.', '[audience cheers and applauds]', 'He’s so much smarter. You know when you’re around your dog, he’s like, “You’re different. tell me what to do.” That’s me. I’m like, “When they land, you’ll tell them I’m cool?” [Rogan and audience laugh] I was having a conversation with that guy where he was explaining to me how this rocket ship his company designed is gonna move civilization to Mars and about how we have to become a multiplanetary species to survive natural disasters, and it’s a six-month journey in this rocket. He’s telling me all the calculations, and halfway through him explaining this, I stop paying attention. And while he’s talking, all I’m imagining… I’m imagining four dudes strapped into a rocket, on their way to Mars. [imitates rocket] One guy pulls out a gun. Boom! Shoots that guy. Bang! Shoots that guy. Boom! Blows his own brains out. Leaves one guy alive going: [screams] Flying all the way to Mars, strapped in next to three dead dudes. I don’t know why I was thinking that. I wish I was paying attention. I’m talking to the smartest guy alive, and I’m thinking, “Should I tell him?', '[audience laughs]', 'I should probably tell him my idea. He doesn’t know you can get a gun up your ass.” I had a whole backstory. That guy had an affair with that guy’s wife and tricked him to go to Mars. Yeah, he’s not… Elon’s not thinking these things. He’s… If evolution’s real, that guy’s ahead of us. I don’t know if evolution’s real. I’ve done zero research. I always say I think it’s real, because if you don’t, people are mean. But it’s a terrible story. Like, if a moron told you the story of evolution, you’d be like, “What happened?” “Once upon a time, giant lizards ruled the Earth, then a rock came from the sky and killed them. Then a little shrew just kept doing its best. And one day it became a person.” [audience laughs] I thought, “Yeah, fuck that story, I’m sticking with Jesus.”', '[audience cheers]', 'That story sucks a fat dick, son. Because even if you’re right, you have no incentive. If we all go to darkness, I think I’m going to heaven. I sleep like a baby. You’re on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. You’re a fucking idiot for not believing in dumb shit. You sleep better. Look, I believe in evolution. I just don’t think all the monkeys crossed the finish line at the exact same time. [audience laughs] I have a feeling there’s probably some trial and error. You know? And I have a feeling somewhere in my ancestry, someone was like, “Fuck it. One more time with a monkey.” [audience laughs] Probably late in the game too, like at the buzzer. If you know, evolution probably took a long-ass time. Not like one day we woke up and we were people. It was thousands of years, a lot of gray area. And if you know human men, there had to be a moment in history where a group of guys had to pull their buddy aside and go: “Hey, man, you gotta stop fucking monkeys.” [audience laughs] “Dude, she’s cool.” [audience laughs] “She does sign language.” Like, “Sign language?” You look over, the monkey’s going like this: [audience laughs] “Man, I don’t think that counts. I don’t think that’s real sign language.” [laughs] [sighs]', '[men hollering]', 'Genes are so weird… Thank you. Genes are weird because people are proud of them, but didn’t do shit to earn them. But we’re all guilty of it. If you do a DNA test and find out you got some cool stuff in there. Like, I found out I have 1.6% African in my DNA.', '[audience cheers]', 'Thank you! It’s all dick! It’s not a big number. That’s not my point. Here’s my point. 1.6% is not a lot of African. I don’t know what percentage African you have to be where you can freely say the N-word. [audience laughs] But from my personal experience, I will tell you that 1.6% appears to be insufficient. [audience laughs] The juice is not worth the squeeze, kids. Yeah, nobody gives a fuck about context. So I don’t say the N-word, but I definitely have, and… I would lie to you, but there’s a lot of evidence. Like… [audience laughs] I never said it to be racist, because I’m not racist. But if I was gonna quote a great Richard Pryor bit, I wouldn’t fuck it up by saying “the N-word.” I’d just say the actual word. I thought everybody would understand. But then somebody made a compilation of every time I ever said that word over the last 15 years, and they made a YouTube video, and it turns out that looks racist as fuck!', '[audience laughs]', 'Even to me! I’m me, and I’m watching me, and I’m going, “Stop saying it! You’re not allowed to say it!” I put my cursor over the video, I’m like, “Four more minutes?” [audience laughs] “Oh, my God, I gotta move to Florida. I gotta live with the swamp people now! Because I said me a magic word.” Here’s the thing about these words, you can’t say them. But that’s unfortunate. Because words are just supposed to be a sound you make so I know what you’re thinking. I can’t wait until we can read minds. Because a lot of people out there say, “Have a nice day”, and they want you to get AIDS.', '[audience laughs]', 'Okay? I don’t think the sound you make with your face is our big problem. And I don’t think we should ban words, because some of them are fun to say. Here’s my suggestion. I think you should pay money to use the most offensive words then that money goes to cancer research. I think we can fix cancer. Here’s my thought. Every time you renew your car registration, you can buy five “retard” tags. [audience laughs] Imagine if that’s all it took. Imagine if retard tags cured cancer. How would CNN even report on it? [audience laughs] But you know, a lot of people will tell you: “Hey, you should never say that word.” And you know what? I agree. You should never say that word sometimes.', '[audience laughs]', 'Right? Sometimes. Like, if you’re a good person… If you’re talking to a child with a developmental disorder, you would never dream of using that word, right? But if you’re talking to a regular grown man who made a documentary about the world being flat? [audience laughs] Yeah, he doesn’t have extra chromosomes. He’s fucking retarded.', '[audience cheers]', 'And if you don’t say it that way, he doesn’t know how you really feel. And he doesn’t get the feedback we all need to learn and grow. A lot of people say, “You’re a hypocrite. You’ll say the R-word, but you won’t say the N-word?”', 'Yeah!', '[audience laughs] Because I’m more afraid of Black people than I am retards.', '[audience laughs]', 'Duh. Don’t you know how jokes work, faggot? [audience laughs] It’s all just supposed to be funsies. Words are for fun, kids. Try explaining that. “Why did you laugh at that?” You go to work tomorrow, “It was really funny.” [audience laughs] The problem isn’t words, folks. The problem is phones. We have these complaint boxes we carry around with us. We’re constantly checking in to see what the most complain-y people think about everything. And it’s not a lot of people. And it’s affecting culture. This is what most people don’t know. Ninety percent of all tweets are made by 10% of the people. And those people are 100% retarded.', '[audience laughs]', 'It’s phones! It’s being connected to everywhere. And it’s weird. We’re weirdly connected. Like, I never leave my house without my phone. I leave my kids at home all the time. [audience laughs] I love my kids way more than I love my phone, but I will let certain people watch my kids, you know? Like my wife’s mom, she’s an amazing grandmother. Never trust that bitch on my phone. Like, “Hey, get out of there, Nana! That’s my real brain.” Can you imagine unlocking your phone, giving it to your wife’s mom, going “I’ll be back in an hour”?', '[audience laughs]', 'Look, I’m a good guy, but I say a lot of shit to my friends that I don’t really mean but I think it’s funny. I don’t wanna have to explain that to a 75-year-old lady. [imitating woman] “Look, read it. He says he’s gonna kill you and fuck me. [audience laughs] He sent that to all his friends. And they all thumbs-upped. Look at all the thumbs up, these fucking psychopaths. Oh, and there’s a lot of pictures of other guys’ dicks on his phone. Do you know about those?” [normal voice] I send my wife pictures of other dudes’ dicks just to see if she’s paying attention. [audience laughs] If you wanna find out if you got a good jewel, you gotta bring them a fake diamond. You gotta stay crafty or these hoes get bored. Every day’s a fucking game!', '[audience laughs]', 'No, not really. “What, really?” No. My wife’s mom is a lovely lady. She’s 75 years old and single. So I said to my wife, “Why don’t we take her to one of those nice places where there’s guys her age.” She goes, “No. They all go crazy and they get STDs.” She has an article saved, an article about a rash of STDs at nursing homes. I’m reading it, I go, “Okay, this is the difference between you and me. Because if there was a place where I could take my grandpa and he would definitely get herpes? I would fill that old dude up with so much viagra that he goes deaf. I’d give him a couple extra twists of his mustache and push him toward those old hoes. “Let’s go, Grandpa!” I’d be in that parking lot with a conch shell. [imitates horn] Every man wants his grandfather to be the savage of the nursing home. You go to visit grandpa, he’s got an army helmet on, open bathrobe, bottle of Jack, big old hard-on, blacked-out naked old ladies in his room. He’s like, “I fuck, and I wait for the Lord!”', '[audience applauds]', '[laughs] I’m glad you guys laughed because my wife didn’t think any of the shit I just said was funny. She’s like, “Don’t write it down.” I’m like, “You’re too close to this, baby.” She goes, “Who wants to have sex with a 75-year-old woman?” I’m like, “A 102-year-old man.” He’d be pumped. “She’s a good one. She was born after the war. They had better food.” He survived ‘Nam, let him fuck! “This is bullshit. You don’t mean it. You don’t want that for your grandfather.” That’s what he wanted. He told me. He told me! I’m not guessing. I was very close with my grandfather. I got drunk with my grandpa before he died. I go, “Grandpa, how do you wanna die?” He goes, “I want a Russian nurse riding the old shlazool, with her hands on my neck, and right when I’m about to nut, I wanna look her in the eye and go, ‘Fuck you, and fuck Stalin.’ [imitates choking]', '[audience laughs and applauds]', 'And bam! I had a great life.” I will never forget that day because I was 6 years old.', '[audience laughs]', 'San Antonio, I love you to death! Thank you very much, this was a lot of fun!', '[audience cheers and applauds]', 'We did it! We did it! This was the first time I’ve done anything like this live, it was fun! I can only do it because you people are so fucking cool! Thank you very much! Thanks for coming out! Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, brother. Thank you. Thank you!', '[rock music plays]', 'Thank you! Thank you, guys, thank you! Thank you. Thank you, guys. Let’s fucking go. Let’s fucking go! Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

Please welcome Hannah Berner!', '[audience cheering]', '[“Sonata Slay” by Chris B. Harris playing]', '[audience continues cheering]', 'What the fuck is up, Philadelphia?!', '[cheering]', 'You little hoagie hoes, sit down! Oh, okay, church. [laughs] I do have to address, there was absolutely no need to do the worm there. I don’t know… I don’t know why I did it, but it happened.', '[audience cheering]', '[Hannah] Thank you. You guys, I just turned 30.', '[audience cheering]', 'Twenty-nine months ago. And I feel good. But society tries to scare the shit out of you when you turn 30. They’re like, if you’re not fucking your face with a jade roller. If you’re not snorting lines of collagen. If you’re not doing Pilates, which is BDSM. If you’re not putting snail mucin, snail ejaculate all over your face. By the time you turn 30, they make you feel like you’re just gonna become… Joe Biden. I’m just kidding. Women can’t be president. That would be insane. And commercials are so cruel. Commercials are like, “Do you have a fine line?” “Eww.” “Do you have a gray hair?” “Disgusting.” “Men are never gonna notice you ever again.” And I’m like, “That sounds… so peaceful.” Just to be able to walk home at night without a worry in the world?', '[audience cheering]', 'I can’t wait till I’m the age that I’m just unkidnappable. How fucking freeing. But you know what’s crazy. I’m 32.', '[audience cheering]', 'Thank you. And I’ve never been kidnapped once. And that’s when you have to ask yourself, “Am I fucking ugly?” I’m not ugly, but I do have issues. I do have issues. I have depression.', '[audience cheers]', 'I have anxiety.', '[audience cheers]', '[laughs] I have chronic fatigue. Any chronic fatigue girlies?', '[audience cheering]', 'You do not have chronic fatigue. She’s like, “Yeah!” No, I went to the doctor, and I was like, “I don’t feel good.” “I don’t feel motivated. What’s wrong with me?” And he goes, “You haven’t drank water since 1994.” And he’s so fucking right. I hate water. I think it’s disgusting. He said I have to get an emotional support water bottle. Girls nowadays, they don’t want a boyfriend. They just want a Stanley. But I think it’s a conspiracy that I have to drink so much water. You know, like, male conspiracy theories is 9/11, the election, the clit.', '[audience laughs]', 'It’s girl conspiracy theories that we need to drink gallons of water. What’s a gallon? That’s made up. Also, we look like pilgrims with pails. Walking around, it’s like, “You work from home, Stephanie.” “You’re not walking the Oregon Trail.” [laughing] Does anyone drink black coffee?', '[woman shouts]', 'Yeah, you like to get choked. Anyone drink Mountain Dew?', '[woman exclaims]', 'I can see her glowing in the dark. That is liquid Chernobyl. What are you doing? Does anyone drink Diet Coke?', '[audience cheering]', 'You guys are all not okay. And no one’s talking about it. Girls are running around like… [screeching] My friend has six Diet Cokes a day. And I’m like, “Look, I’m not a doctor.” “But I don’t think that’s good for you.” And she’s like, “What? There’s no sugar.” “There’s no calories.” And I’m like, “Then what the fuck is in it?” ‘Cause heroin doesn’t have sugar or calories, and that’s not great for you. I’m not saying Diet Coke is heroin, but I’ve never seen them in the same room together. I wish the most essential liquid was an espresso martini.', '[audience cheers]', 'Whoo-hoo! ‘Cause it’s a triple threat, right? It gets you drunk. It gets you hyper, and you will have diarrhea at the end of the night. You are light as a feather on the dance floor. You’re like, “Ooh! Ooh-ooh-ooh!” [woman 2] $60 here.', 'You had a $60 espresso martini?', '[woman 2] Thirty each.', 'Thirty each.', '[woman 2] So we spent $60. Plus, the wage gap. I’m fucking fuming.

But this was… Was this pre? She was before? So they copied her. That’s like Hannah Montana and me. I was first. Yeah. Wait. Isis copied your brand. That’s embarrassing for them. Get your own fucking brand. Do you… Do you have a nickname? No? That’s horrible.', '[audience laughs]', 'So someone will just be like, “Isis is coming,” and they’re like, “What?” Her middle name is Persephone.', 'Her middle name is Persephone?', '[woman 3] Persephone. [hesitates] Like Stephanie with a purr in the beginning?', 'Purr-Stephanie.', '[woman 3] Persephone. What white trash shit is going on right now? [laughing] That was good. That was good. That was really good. You’ll see it on Netflix. That was funny. [laughing] [sighs] Oh, guys. There’s no easy way to segue this. But I’ve been really into politics lately. [laughing] Now, look, regard… Thank you, one person. Regardless what you believe in, we all can agree it’s been a little messy. The last 200 years. And I think we need a fresh perspective. And I think I can bring that perspective.', '[audience cheers]', 'I like the group over here that’s like, “Let’s wait to see what she says.” [laughs] Actually, you’re right. I don’t know anything about politics, but I know how to do research. I went on TikTok.', '[audience cheering]', 'And I figured it out, but I went to the hot topics, okay? I went to abortion. Do you know some people believe that you should never have an abortion under any circumstances, even if you’re bloated. And the next one I obviously went to was guns. Do you know some people believe that guns don’t kill people, people kill people? I have one edit. Guns don’t kill people. Men kill people.', '[chuckles]', '[audience cheers] And I’m not coming for the men. I would never come for you. It’s just a fact. 90% of mass shootings, your boys. And the 2% who were women had a very legitimate reason for what we did.', '[audience cheering]', '[laughing] The men are shaking. They’re scared now. They’re like, “Get me the fuck out.” Did you ever see the woman who chopped her husband’s dick off?', '[audience cheering]', 'What did we all think? We all went, “What did he do?” So this is the thing, people want guns. Fine. I just think we need a little more gun safety, and then if I do the girl math, legally, the only people allowed to have guns should be the girls. [cheering] We ride at dawn!', '[audience cheers]', 'He’s so scared. His hand is like… ‘Cause this is the thing, when men snap, they shoot stuff. When a woman truly, truly, truly snaps, she gets bangs. And that’s an assault on ourselves. No one else is hurt. It grows out in six months. You’re good, babe. Also, like if I had a gun, I would lose it in my room.', '[audience laughs]', 'Every five minutes, I’d be like, “Where the… Where the fuck did I…?” “I was holding it all day. Where did I put my…” “Can someone call my gun? Where the fuck did I put my gun?” You get your gun. You’re with your girls. You’re going out, and you’re like, “What purse are you wearing with your gun?” Then you go outside. You’re holding your purse and your gun and Starbucks and keys and tampons. You’re like, “You’re not shooting anyone. You can barely hold anything.” Your nails are like… clap if you have long nails. Yeah, you can barely clap. You’re not shooting up a mall.', '[audience chuckles]', 'And then you get in the Uber to go to the bar, and the girls come out. And you’re like, “Guns! We got our guns.” And then you’re like, “Oh, shoot! I forgot my gun in the Uber.” You’re like, “Hold on.” You’re like, “It’s me again.” “I left my light baby blue Hailey Bieber Rhode Peptide revolver.” Collab. Revolver is actually the only gun that I know. And a musket. Imagine a bunch of hot girls with muskets. Like, “Hold on, my musket.” [thudding] The musket keeps queefing. [grunts] No, you guys, I thought this shit was so funny. Thought it was so funny, so I posted it online. And some people were not happy with me. No, no, no. One guy was like, “It’s not the shooter’s fault.” “It’s the girl’s fault.” “They’re not giving enough blowjobs.” But I’m listening. I’m learning. I said, “I hear you. I see you. New law!” “If you can’t get a blowjob, you can’t get a gun.”', '[cheering]', 'If you really want a gun, you have to go to the blowjob shop. You have to bring a girl to vouch for you.

He was like, “It’s not the shooter’s fault.” “It’s the mom’s fault.” “She didn’t raise him right.” And I was like, “You are so right.” “She didn’t raise the shooter right.” “She should have had an abortion.”', '[audience cheering and applauding]', 'Thank you. What a polite abortion clap. [cheering] I’m gonna say something controversial ’cause you guys are fun. Yeah! Sex is not consistently as good as society makes it seem.', '[audience cheering, shouting]', '[women] Yeah! But I’m not talking about the lesbians. ‘Cause the lesbians, they’re coming. Okay, they’re coming. They’re coming. Are there any lesbians in the crowd? [cheering] They all just came.

How do you actually know when it’s done? Carpal tunnel? Battery dies? I love that she’s standing up. She’s like, “This is my moment.” How do you know when it’s done?', '[woman 5] You get very, very tired.', 'You get very tired. All the straight girls are like, “What is going on?” [laughs] She’s like, “You’ve orgasmed so much that your body is empty.” “And then you just go up to heaven. That’s how you know when it’s done.” “Then you communicate with her afterwards about your feelings. It’s crazy.” I’ll tell you, sexuality is not a choice. That’s how you know. [laughing] We need realistic sex in movies. That’s where we get confused. It’s so unrealistic, these scenes. It’s always the same scene too. It’s two people. They bust down the door, right? They just start going at it. They’re making out. They’re breaking shit. The guy will, like, kick over a lamp. And I’m like, “Don’t touch my home decor.” [laughing] And then the guy always picks the girl up, right? Why does he pick her up like that? And he, like, puts her on the counter. [grunts] It’s like, “First of all, this is a studio apartment.” “My bed is right here.” “Also, don’t put me on my counter.” “My counter’s disgusting.” “Forks, soy sauce, ketchup, Con Ed bills, Invisalign.” “I don’t want my own teeth marks on my back.” Also, then you know, when the P goes in the V in the movies. [sighs] There should be a nuance, right? Like, there’s an angle. It’s hard to just, like, go in, right? In movies, the guy will just unzip his jeans, look over here and go… [grunts] And she’s like… [squeals] And I’m like, “The guy who wrote this movie has never had sex before.” I want realistic sex in movies, you guys.', '[laughs]', '[audience cheers] For example, I queef all the time. And I’ve never heard one queef in a movie. Zero queef representation in movies.', '[audience cheering]', 'Thank you. Also, when I say I’m queefing, I’m farting.', '[audience laughs]', 'But I’m telling him it’s a queef. ‘Cause men have absolutely no clue what a queef is. If it doesn’t smell, you’re Gucci. Get out of there. You got away with it. Also, when I say I’m squirting, I’m peeing. One more note about queefs. Stop saying that I queefed. You queefed me, okay? And I know that for a fact because I’ve never queefed alone. [laughs] You took your needle dick, and you started pumping me with air like a basketball. Sorry you didn’t realize my pussy was so fucking tight that the air was gonna get trapped, and you didn’t anticipate that. But don’t gaslight me and tell me that I queefed when I know for a fact I laid there and did absolutely nothing. [cheering] Doggy’s crazy. No, I like doggy because you can text. [laughing] But you kind of leave it up to him. Like, he needs to figure it out. And that’s when he always, like, accidentally hits the wrong hole. And you have to go, “No.” But he’s pretending like he’s in a dark elevator, clicking every button. Good thing our buttholes have the reflexes of a ninja. And they’re like… [shouts] [laughing] We need realistic sex in movies. Like, you know when you’re riding a guy. Now, ladies, when you’re riding a guy, don’t worry about what’s going on over here. You focus on him. He has 17 chins. He’s going through an exorcism. What, when you lean over, you have a couple rolls? Men can’t tell when you cut your hair eight inches, okay?', 'You do you.', '[audience cheering] But you know when you’re riding a guy… and you kind of lose your rhythm? We were like, “Okay, we’re a team.” “Let’s get this back. Five, six, seven, eight.” “And one and two and three and four.” You know when you’re trying to go like this? But someone gets off, and next thing you know, you’re just going like this? And then he hasn’t been in you for four minutes, and you’re just like… My favorite part though is when you come up and his dick falls out a little? And then you snap it like a glow stick. It hurts. It’s scary. Men, you need to speak up. Stop suffering in silence. It’s happening everywhere, okay? It’s happening everywhere. What are dicks made out of? You have no idea.', '[woman 6] Disappointment.', 'Disappointment. That’s hilarious.', 'What are dicks made out of, babe?', '[man] Collagen. Collagen? Honestly, men will say stuff so confidently that I’m like, “Collagen.” “He’s right. He’s right.” You know, actually, I don’t care. But I don’t wanna snap his dick, but it’s always so funny ’cause they always make that noise, you know? ‘Cause they’re scared. I’m scared. We’re all scared. And he always goes… [gasps] Then I’m like, “You queefed.” I queefed you. I queefed. [laughs] I queefed. [laughing] Anyone ever lost their virginity? [audience cheering] Sluts, a bunch of sluts. I actually lost it once. And it was fucked up. It’s fine that it was fucked up, but no one warns you. Society is like, “Oh, my God. It’s this beautiful coming of age.” “You become a woman.” And then a guy with a shrimp dick rips open your hymen. There’s blood everywhere, and he goes, “Did you come?” And I’m like, “Unless that’s come, I have no clue what just went down.” And orgasming is hard. Like, for a woman to orgasm, for me specifically to orgasm… She’s like, “Yeah. What are you gonna say?” My legs have to be perfectly straight. I have to have zero work emails on my phone. And I need to be alone.', 'Thank you.', '[audience cheering] She’s independent. But shout out to my vibrator. She does great work.', '[audience cheering]', 'They’re souped up. The technology nowadays, you can storm a capitol with one of them. And actually get the job done. Also, the kids are choking now. Someone goes, “What?” She is. And this is my thing with choking. How am I gonna come while I’m also fighting for my life, you know? I understand some people want pain during sex, but if you wanna hurt me during sex, just look me in the eye and say, “I’m disappointed in you.” There are some men in the crowd, which I don’t love. No, I’m fine with men being in the crowd as long as they have a chaperone. Where’s your chaperone, sir? Good.', 'What’s your name?', '[man 2] Eric. Eric with a C or K? C. Thank God. I would have had you kicked out. I like you at the… at the end. What’s your name, sir?', '[man 3] Kevin.', 'Kevin. With a K? Interesting. Oh, he’s coming. [laughing] So what I love about Kevin, you have a beard, a mustache, glasses, and a hat. Are you in Witness Protection? What did you do?', 'Nothing.', '[Hannah] Nothing. That’s what someone who did something would say. I’ll follow up with you later. Who’s single?', '[audience cheering]', 'We know Isis is single. Can you imagine the dating apps? Like, what the…?

Which apps?', 'Hinge and Bumble.', '[Hannah] Hinge and Bumble.', 'It’s a scary place.', '[Hannah] It’s a scary place. No, it is. Hinge is crazy. ‘Cause Hinge, it asks questions. You can see people’s personalities. And I like when guys, like, brag on not-braggy questions. You know, when they’re like, “What’s your hobby?” and he goes, “I’m a jet-setter.” “I travel the globe.” “Don’t hit me up unless you wanna see the world.” I’m like, “Brad, you went to Panama City Beach once during spring break.” “Shut the fuck up.” I have really bad taste in men, but it was never my fault. And it was never their fault. It was Disney’s fault. Disney teaches you to be attracted to the douchiest, most narcissistic guys. It’s never the nice guy. It’s the guy coming in on a horse with a stupid hairdo, like a prince. Doesn’t shut up. Actually, name a Disney prince in the front. You can yell it out, and I’ll tell you why he’s the worst. [woman 8] Eric!', 'Prince Eric wanted to fuck a fish. Next.', '[woman 9] Aladdin! Okay, Aladdin was hot. [laughs] Don’t love the illegal pet monkey, but he did pull off purple. But Aladdin was kind of like that guy on Hinge. He was like, “Jasmin, I’m gonna show you the world on my magic carpet.” He showed her a four-block radius, lied to her face. Sandoval, honestly.', 'Who’s another prince?', '[shouting] Oh, Hercules has ED. Um… Raising awareness. Prince Charming. Okay, Prince Charming. Who nicknames themself Prince Charming? What a little douche. Then he throws a party with all the women in the kingdom, right, for himself. Does a beeline for the girl who’s so blackout, she lost her shoe. Tells her he loves her that night. Next morning, can’t find her when she doesn’t have makeup on. He’s like, “Where’d she go? I don’t recognize her.” Then takes her shoe and puts it on every single girl’s foot in the kingdom. Go on WikiFeet like a normal person with a foot fetish, okay? Leave these women alone!', 'Who else?', '[women shouting] Okay, Simba. You guys, don’t turn on me. Simba was a fuckboy. Simba was such a fuckboy. First of all, Nala’s his cousin. And he kept, like, hitting on her, and finally, she was like, “Okay, Simba, like, I like you.” And he’s like, “Whoa. I need to focus on my career becoming king because my dad fucked me up. Mm.” Who else? Gaston’s obvious. That’s your fault if you fell for Gaston.', '[woman 10] Shrek! Shrek!', 'Who… Shrek. [laughs] Look, Shrek is ugly hot. I would… sit on his face. [laughs] Who else?', '[audience shouting]', 'Flynn Rider sounds like a lacrosse player who did give me chlamydia. [laughing] John Smith was a colonizer. Oh, you guys got tight on that? That’s crazy.', '[woman 11] Captain Hook!', 'Captain Hook. Why do I just get turned on? He just has a rabbit attached to his hand. [laughing] I’ll end with the Beast. I’ll end with the Beast. I’m a Beast apologist. I’m a Beast apologist. They try to make the Beast like he’s this disgusting, horrible monster. The Beast is 6’4″. Pulls off capris. Looks like Travis Kelce. He’s a homeowner with a mansion and a library. That’s old money. That’s “fuck you” money. I know some of you guys are like, “Hannah.” “He was super controlling.” “He never let her leave the house.” That’s my literal dream. To never leave a mansion and have gay utensils getting me food the entire time! [cheering] Hi, zaddy in the blue. There’s a beautiful bald man right here. Is that your man? Is that your man? I’m so jealous of bald men. It is so shimmery and beautiful, like a… like a baby dolphin, okay? I’m so jealous of bald men, ’cause why can’t my pussy be that smooth? It’s ingrowns. I needed a Weedwacker to get here. I’m half-Italian, okay? And it’s not fair. It’s not fair. ‘Cause when men are hairy, you know, it’s fine. You know, they call ’em bears. You know what they call girls who are hairy? Single. And it’s not cool. It’s not feminist.', 'Where’d you two meet?', '[woman 12] It’s my dad. Oh, it’s your dad. [laughing] Ladies. [laughing]', '[audience cheering]', '[laughing] Perfect segue. I actually got married, you guys. I got married.', '[audience cheering]', 'It’s super off-brand for me. I got married, but it’s to an older man.', '[audience cheering]', 'A zaddy, if you will. And I love an older man. I love an older man. Because they are so tired. They’re exhausted. They’re not chasing women on the street. They’re on the verge of arthritis. You get in a fight with them, five minutes in, they’re like, “Yeah, whatever you want.” ‘Cause they wanna go to sleep. I love that about him. He’s not going out at night. The only thing going anywhere is his hairline. And I love that, clearly. If you wanna meet an older man, go to a Walgreens. Go to the Advil section. Put some in the palm of your hand and just go… [clicks tongue] They’ll limp over like delicate pigeons. Adorable. We actually… We got engaged in six months. Yeah. Because he doesn’t have a lot of time left. I had a bachelorette. It was pretty crazy. But bachelorettes, they’re intense, you know, right? I feel like bachelor parties, all the guys do is see a quarter of a nipple, and they’re like, “It was the greatest weekend of my life.” I think bachelorettes are cults.', '[woman 13] Yeah, for sure. And if you’re quiet right now, you’re in one. ‘Cause think about it. Stephanie chooses you to be a part of something bigger. And then she takes you to an undisclosed location. Scottsdale, Arizona. You’re dehydrated. You’re sunburned. You’re scared. You’re blackout. You’ve lost $2,000. You’ve also lost your job. If you even look at another bridesmaid and you’re, like… Isn’t this a lot? She’ll be like, “Do you not support Stephanie?” And I’m like, “No, no, no, no.” “I’m here for Stephanie. I support Stephanie.” And then you have to give speeches every night about how great Stephanie is. I’m like, “This is Stephanie’s third marriage. I’m exhausted.” “We’re running out of stories, Steph.” And then she makes you all wear the same bikinis, even though we all have different body types. That’s abuse. We have to wear shirts that say, like, “bitch, bride, tribe, cunt.” I’m like, “How did we get here?” What I’m trying to say is Scientology started in Charleston, and no one talks about it.', 'Nobody talks about it.', '[cell phone chiming] Oh! [laughs] Take your birth control. [laughing] Speaking of birth control, I, um, hooked up with my husband on our wedding night. Yeah. Did anyone… did anyone not hook up on their wedding night? Kevin, what happened? You what? You were… or you were running from the police. So you guys played hard to get on your wedding night. You were like, “Figure it out tomorrow.” What were you drinking? What’s your drink of choice, Kevin? [Kevin] Beer.', 'Beer.', '[Kevin speaks indistinctly]', 'You what? You took a what?', '[Kevin speaks indistinctly] A dick pill. You took a dick pill? Kevin, I didn’t ask about this. I don’t wanna know that. I asked about your beer. [laughing] So you were just passed out with a rock-hard dick. And she’s like, “Get it… stop poking me with that.” When did you take the dick pill in the night? I just wanna know.', '[Kevin] At noon.', 'At noon? So you were on the altar just like… [laughing] Wait, so you planned to have a crazy, rip-roaring night of seven hours of sex and you had two beers, and you were like… [speaks gibberish] [laughing] You know, I support men taking pills. Because we’re taking birth control, Lexapro, Xanax. Take one fucking dick pill. Honestly, I think I had sex on my wedding night ’cause he’s sober. So he was ready to go, but I realized on my wedding night that I hadn’t taken my birth control in two weeks.', 'And my friend Paige. You guys know Paige.', '[audience cheering] So she blacked out at my wedding. Stumbled over to me with her long little fingers. And she was like, “You’re gonna get pregnant on your wedding night.” And you know when, like, you can’t not believe her? ‘Cause if you do, you’re like, “Why didn’t I fucking listen to that blackout bitch?” I am so bad with my birth control. I’ll miss two days, I’ll take four. I miss five days, I’ll take seven. I’ll miss a week, and I’ll just put one up my butthole. I’m like, “I’m on track.” Does anyone cheat with an IUD?', 'Do you have an IUD?', '[woman 14] Yes. What kind do you have? Copper, silver, rose gold?', '[woman 14] Kyleena.', 'Kyleena. Why is it always a hot girl’s name? It’s like, “Kyleena.” “Mirela.” Did it hurt?', '[woman 14] Worst of my life.', 'Ooh! I feel like they don’t warn you how much it hurts. I feel like a doctor takes a paperclip, and it’s like, “Hold on one second.” [shouts] Walk it off. When men get vasectomies, they get airlifted to the Bahamas. A nurse is cupping his balls. She’s like, “You’re doing amazing.” “Cough if you need. I’ll feed you grapes.” So I realize the night of my wedding… [exhales] …that, um, I was ovulating. I’ll explain what that is to you later, Kevin. And the next morning, I was like, “I need to wake this guy up.” “We have a problem.” He’s old, so whenever I wake him up, I’m always like, “Are you alive?” He’s like, “What?” [exhales] I’m like, “Do you wanna have a baby?” And he’s like, “I kind of wanna travel for two to three years.” And I’m like, “You’re 47. Where the fuck haven’t you been?” You wanna go to Mars, Jeff Bezos? Like, who do you think you are? Carmen Sandiego? I go, “You know what? Let’s travel to Walgreens, your favorite place, ’cause I need to get Plan B.” Now, I don’t care how many times you’ve been to this Walgreens, when you go for Plan B, you’ve never seen this establishment before. It’s dark. It’s haunted. It smells different. You’re full main-character energy when you walk in. You’re always like… [sighs] How can I get pregnant as a teenager? [sighs] What am I gonna do? [exhales] And then you go up to the guy who hates you, and you’re like, “Do you have Plan B?” And he’s like, “What?” And you’re like, “Plan B.” He’s like, “Hold on one sec.” “Disheveled girl in aisle six is irresponsible with her pussy lips.” “And she needs Plan B.” And he’s like, “Let’s go to the family planning aisle.” And I’m like, “No, no, no. I need the family unplanning aisle.” And then you get there, and it’s locked up like Fort Knox. They’re locking up everything nowadays, like multivitamins. Who’s tweaking on a multivitamin? And then he tries to open it up and you’re like, “Be quiet about it.” And then he takes, like, a power tool, and he’s like… [shouting] Um… and then he gives it to you, and you’re like, “Thank you. I’m a teenager.” And then when you go outside to open it up, it has seven layers of the hardest plastic I’ve ever seen in my life. And I don’t walk around with a chainsaw. [sighs] I’m trying to get rid of my maybe-baby. Anyway, that’s how I lost my virginity. It was crazy. That’s the thing with an older man. He is… he is deteriorating emotionally and physically, which is the goal. Like, before we got married, he really annoyed me because we went to a fancy Italian restaurant. This small restaurant. I ordered a burrata. Do you guys have burrata in Philly?', '[audience cheering]', 'Oh, I love burrata. Three things better than sex. Burrata. Q-tip in your ear, ’cause it’s naughty. [laughs] And revenge. I fucking love revenge. So, I ordered the burrata. I open it up. It’s like… [squelches] You know… [squelches] He looks at me, and he’s like, “I think I’m gonna faint.” And I’m like, “I know. This burrata is so good.” [laughs] And he’s like, “No, like, could you call an ambulance?” And you know when that’s just, like, not the vibe? I start Googling. I’m like, “How do you even call an ambulance?” Is there, like, a quiet ambulance or, like, a Zoom or, like, a telehealth? And he’s like, “Can you just get the waitress?” And I’m like, “I’m not getting other people involved in your shit right now.” And finally, he hails down the waitress, and she starts freaking out. She starts calling. She’s like, “911, a man needs 911!” Everyone in the restaurant’s upset. They’re getting up. Some people are fanning him. He’s loving the attention. He’s like… [panting] Then, for the ambulance people to come, they had to, like, take the table away with my burrata. And I’m like, “Okay.” We also have to pay for this food, and I forgot my wallet in my other coat. So I was like, “Babe.” “Babe.” “Babe, I need your wallet.” He popped up, and he’s like, “I’m fucking dying here. You need my fucking wallet?” And the guy next to him is like, “Don’t speak to your daughter like that.” I’m like, “Thanks, Dad.” “We need to leave a hefty tip after the shit you pulled tonight.” And then the EMT lady came, and she knew exactly what was going on. I looked at her. She looked at me. He was having an amateur-hour panic attack. Now, as a hot girl, that’s just how we wake up in the morning, okay? I’ve had four panic attacks on stage tonight. And you know what we do? We suck it the fuck up!', '[cheering]', 'But it’s not men’s fault, okay? ‘Cause if they feel any emotion besides anger, they’re like… [voice breaks] “Could you call 911?” So she looked at him, and she was like, “You know, you’re gonna be fine.” “Um, are you nervous about anything?” And he was like, “I am nervous about getting married in a couple months.” And I was like, “Oh, now we’re playing the blame game.” And she’s like, “Look, you don’t have to go to the hospital.” “Stop drinking so much Diet Coke. Drink the water, breathe.” “You’re gonna be fine.” He’s like, “Yeah, okay, I don’t have to go to the hospital. I feel better.” And I’m like, “This is so embarrassing.” So everyone goes back to their seat, and I’m like, “What is he gonna do?” Like, “How is he gonna get out of this?” This man stands up, and he goes, “It wasn’t the food. Have a good night.” And I’m like, “Did he just have a closer?” My dad thinks I’m on my phone too much. He’s like, “You’re addicted to your phone. You’re always on your phone.” I’m like, “Dad, you’re always on your phone.” “‘Cause you text with your index finger. It takes you fucking forever.” I’m on TikTok a lot. I am. I’m on TikTok. What’s interesting to me, who’s not on TikTok? Okay, why are you not on TikTok? Are you afraid to know who you really are? [woman 15] I’m 38. You’re 38, a young spring chicken.', 'Are you on Reels?', 'No, but Instagram. Like, I’m not even on Snapchat. You should not be on Snapchat. You’re 38. [laughing] It’s just 22-year-old dongs on Snapchat. If you’re on Reels, I feel like Reels is like Juuling. TikTok is cigarettes. We’re all gonna die. Also, if you’re on Reels, that means you just found out that Pete Davidson and Kim Kardashian broke up, and I love that for you. Love that for you. Do you see the kids still doing dances? Like, it’s been a while. They’re dancing a little too long. I was wondering, I’m like, “Why are they doing this”? And then I realized, I think these kids are communicating with each other. To overtake us. And this is a violent motion. You just saw my labia. That was crazy. [laughing] But think about it. These kids are strong. Like, they survived Tide Pods. They’re sturdy in a fight. And they’re smart. Like, when they were at restaurants, they had their iPads. Three years old. Beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep. Fuck you, Mom. Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. When I was two at a restaurant, I was trying to see how many butter packets I could shove in my face without puking. My dad’s like, “Nine. That’s my girl. She’s gonna go far.” Do you guys know Jeremy? I babysat this kid named Jeremy. I hate this kid. I’d have to bribe him to do everything. I’d be like, “Jeremy.” “If you finish your math homework, you get chocolate ice cream.” He said, “Shut up, slut.” I was like, “Jeremy, don’t talk to me like that, or you’re gonna turn me on.” We’re having fun. It’s Saturday. We’re having fun.', '[audience cheering]', '[laughs] What if I did that? That would be crazy. Every time… Anyway, back to me, um…', 'I have intimacy issues.', '[woman 16] Don’t we all. Do you like to cuddle? You do? Do you like to be the big or small spoon? Both. He’s verse. He’s freaky. Actually, as a girl, it’s a lot more complicated when we’re the small spoon. Lots of things can go wrong. Think about it. First, you have to get into a weird little fetal position, right? Then you have to move your hair, so it’s out of his face but still looks cute. You’re like, “Hey!” And then he takes his big dumb hand. And he always puts it right here. Gut check. [gasps] You have to suck in like you’ve never sucked in before. You’re like, “I’m so little, so tiny.” “I’m so little.” [groans] He’s like, “Are you comfortable?” You’re like, “Sucking up my rolls!” But as you’re sucking in, God forbid a little air wants to come out. Your butt is right on his penis. The whole relationship is on the line. It’s so much pressure, and you can’t sweat even though there’s a hot body lying on you. So hold your pores. Hold your butthole. Just go… [shouts] There’s a zero percent chance you’re falling asleep. Meanwhile, he falls asleep immediately. The second his head hits the pillow, he’s like… [snoring] ‘Cause he’s so tired from gaslighting all day. It’s crazy.', '[audience cheering]', 'But I like to pivot. I like to pivot and put my head on his chest. Life hack. Then you can lift a butt cheek. The air comes out silent. You pray it’s not sulfuric. You pray. You don’t wanna Oppenheimer his entire bedroom. If it smells, you blame the dog. I don’t know why there’s always a dog staring at you. He’s like, “Ever since I met you, the dog’s been having a lot of stomach issues.” And I’m like, “You should get that checked.” But I love to put my head on his chest. It feels so good. Because you feel his heart beating, and you’re like, “This is love.” And you feel his chest go up and down. And you’re like, “Wouldn’t it be so cute if I matched my breath with his breath, and we became one soul, taking on this harsh, cold, scary world together?” But then, as you’re doing it… [exhaling] You’re like deejaying your breath to his breath. You know when you’re going too slow and you feel like… [gasps] [exhales] You’re really trying to catch up. You’re fighting for your life. You kind of forget how to fucking breathe. There’s no air going in or out. You could die. The dog’s like, “Die, bitch, please die.” [laughing] Yeah. Also, sex in the shower. Don’t do it. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. Kevin, don’t. Don’t have sex in the shower, okay? ‘Cause guys and girls like different temperatures. Girls like it lava hot ’cause we’re related to Satan. And guys like it lukewarm ’cause they’re confused. They don’t know what’s going on. Then you go to his bathroom. He’s not gonna have conditioner, which is disrespectful. Doesn’t support women in the arts. Or he has the three in one. Which should be called zero. ‘Cause I’m dirtier after using it. And it always has these insane names. It’s like Rock Hard Mountain. Punch a Wall Pinewood. Throbbing Thunder. Like, is this an Andrew Tate haiku? [laughing] You know when he’s taking up all the shower water and you’re just, like, freezing your tits off, and you’re like, “How do I become Jack at the end of the Titanic?” [chuckles] There’s room for me here. You have to distract him and take your hair and put it on the back of his shower wall. This is how we mark our territory. It’s female graffiti. Put your fucking initials if you’re feeling artsy. ‘Cause he’s never washed that wall, and he never will. Also, don’t do anal in the shower. It will hurt so bad, my f-friend told me. [chuckles] Once a guy texted me to sit on his face. That’s not straightforward. No one tells you, you don’t actually sit on the guy’s face. You have to do this weird, like, hover. Like you’re at a Porta Potti at Coachella, okay? Oh. You gotta use your pelvis, get your core in. Do I like the fact that I can suffocate a tiny man with my labia? Absolutely. He’s having trouble. He can’t find your clit. He’s on your kneecap, and you’re like, “This feels so good.” You’re patting his forehead. He looks like a Ninja Turtle. Then, you know, halfway through, you just start spacing out at the white wall in front of you And you’re like, “How did we get here, Hannah?” Where is his headboard? Is that a Mike Tyson poster? Why is his name Eric with a C? [laughs] [laughing]', 'You guys think I should have kids?', '[audience cheering] I’ll make a decision based on what you guys say right now. I’ll do it.', '[audience continues cheering]', 'Okay, I’m getting a lot of mixed. You’re pointing at your daughter right now, saying “no”? She’s gonna be funny, have a good sense of humor. I like that. She’s like… But I do feel like I get mixed… I get a lot of mixed messages from moms. They’ll be like, “It’s the happiest you’ll ever be, but you’ll never be happy again.” And I’m like, what kind of fucking riddle…', 'You’re a mom?', '[woman 17] Yeah. I actually became an aunt, though. I’m an aunt. So I’m an aunt.', '[audience cheering]', 'I’m an auntie. I love when people congratulate me. ‘Cause my brother made a mistake. No, I’m just kidding. He did it on purpose, and I know that. ‘Cause him and his wife were going around being like, “We’re trying. We’re trying.” And I’m like, “Oh!” Just tell people you’re raw dogging. Stop romanticizing it. Me and you are doing the same. You’re praying for a baby. I’m praying to not have a baby. One more thing about abortion. [laughs] Have you guys seen Nick Cannon? Has he come to Philly? Close your pussies. It’s crazy out there. He has 12 children with six different women. I actually wasn’t that judgey. I was like, “Go off, Nick Cannon, do your thing.” Until I saw the name of one of these children. It’s a beautiful name. It was weird for me. The name is Powerful Queen. That’s an adjective. It was the full name that really got me. The full name is Powerful Queen Cannon. Because that’s the name of my vibrator. [exhales]', 'Thank you so much, Philadelphia!', '[audience cheering]', 'I love you guys so much!', '[“Sonata Slay” playing]', '[cheering continues]', '[shouting]', '[audience shouting]', 'They told me I could stand up here for, like, ten seconds. I love you, babe.', '[cheering continues]', '♪ ‘Cause all I do is slay, slay all day ♪', '♪ Slaying anything And anyone that’s in my way ♪', '♪ You just good ♪', '♪ But I’m so great Do whatever it takes, all I do is slay ♪']]\n"

The show opens with a spirited introduction from his daughter, setting the stage for a performance rooted in self-deprecating humor, small-town nostalgia, and sharp observations about modern absurdities. Bargatze’s storytelling shines as he recounts his days as a water meter reader, his failed attempts to manage daily routines without his wife’s guidance, and his humorous take on aging and familial dynamics.']"

              " 'Nate Bargatze’s 2024 Netflix stand-up special, Your Friend, Nate Bargatze, is a comedic journey through the absurdities of everyday life. With his signature deadpan delivery, Bargatze riffs on relatable topics like pizza-ordering dilemmas, domestic quirks with his frugal wife, and parenting mishaps, weaving personal anecdotes with exaggerated humor. The show opens with a spirited introduction from his daughter, setting the stage for a performance rooted in self-deprecating humor, small-town nostalgia, and sharp observations about modern absurdities. Bargatze’s storytelling shines as he recounts his days as a water meter reader, his failed attempts to manage daily routines without his wife’s guidance, and his humorous take on aging and familial dynamics.',\n",
              " 'The special thrives on Bargatze’s ability to find comedy in the mundane, whether it’s debating the dominance of dogs sleeping in beds or lamenting the complexities of fast-food drive-throughs. His observations on generational quirks, from his parents’ idiosyncrasies to his own aging mishaps, resonate universally. The show crescendos with his musings on societal advancements, juxtaposed with his small-town upbringing, culminating in laugh-out-loud reflections on AI, modern hotels, and outdated services like wake-up calls. Through it all, Bargatze maintains a warm and engaging rapport with his audience, delivering a feel-good hour of humor that blends sharp wit with heartfelt relatability.',\n",

Two would be fun. Our dog sleeps in our bed, and someone told me you’re not supposed to do that, ’cause you lose dominance over the dog.

Then I was like, “Well, my back hurts too.” You know? So… Well, what’s in the middle? What muscle is in the middle? I went hiking. I jumped off a rock. I mean, a foot high. When I landed, it felt what I would imagine being struck by lightning feels like. I felt it through my fingernails. Fifty-fifty if my zipper’s up or down anymore. It’s a true flip of the coin. I don’t know what’s happening. I’ve zipped up my whole life. And now, just head out, like, “All right, see you boys later.” Just head out. Take my pants off at home. They come off easy. I’m like, “Ah, that was four hours I was walking around like…” I think it’s ’cause I’m peeing so much longer. And I’m not used to this new old rhythm yet. ‘Cause in your 40s, there’s a lot of false stops. You learn pretty quick to be like, “Let’s hang back.” “Let’s let traffic thin out a little bit.” I watch young people come and go. I’m like, “Tell my family I’m okay.” Food is still… I still have a problem with food. I… I love processed food. I love it. I’m a farm-factory-table guy.',\n",

              " 'I want… I want the most hands involved in my food. It’s coming to an end. You can feel… I can feel it. I can’t do it anymore. It really hurts. I… You know, and I tell myself, like, “I’ve done it. I was…” Yeah, my jersey would be retired of eating fast food. I’ve done all the stuff. I’ve had Taco Bell and threw it away in my neighbor’s trash so my wife didn’t find out. I used so much ketchup once at a restaurant, that a stranger walked up to me and goes, “That’s a lot of ketchup.” Do you know how much ketchup you got to use? That guy doesn’t want to get involved, you know? But he sees it. I mean, his wife’s like, “Let it go.” He’s like, “I think I got to say something. I don’t…” “I don’t think he knows that we’re all… No one’s using that much ketchup.” I went to a McDonald’s drive-through and my window did not roll down. That’s the universe saying, “Give it a rest.” And I fought through it. It’s embarrassing, because they can tell, because I had to pull past… Because I got to open my door, so it’s going to hit the speaker. So I gotta drive by it. So the car behind me is like, “Are you leaving?” I’m like, “My window don’t roll down.” And I got to open the door. Now the speaker is by the gas tank. So I gotta yell my order out. Now that guy hears it. And then I look at McDonald’s screen, well, they got it all on the board, just let the neighborhood know what I’m ordering. And then I drove by the window, the drive-through window, and I got to go by it, ’cause I got to open my whole door. So I go by it, and I see them, they’re like, “Where are you going?” I was like, “Nowhere.” And I go by, and they see my whole body sitting in a chair. It’s crazy. If you’ve never done it, it’s the most vulnerable I ever felt in my life. Just… You’re just sitting there, and you’re like, “Hi.”',\n",
              " 'They see your feet. They see your feet. They just throw it at me like a bear, just throw it. Our family, we just eat a lot of fast food. Our family text thread, my dad texted, he was like, “I found a way to get a Big Mac cheaper.” And he said, “You can order a double cheeseburger and ask for Big Mac sauce.” So he goes, “It’s cheaper, and they get rid of that third bun, so it’s Atkins.” Uh… That’s how you do it. That third bun is the one you’re like, “I don’t know if I need the third bun.” My parents are getting older, they’re not super old, but they’re at the age where, you know, if they trip, they will fall to the ground. There’s just an age where it hap… I mean… Like, if I trip, my body hasn’t touched the ground in 40 years. But for them, it’s just, I don’t know. It’s like the upper is like, “We’re going.” And… the lower is like, “What?” And it’s just… Boom. And I mean, there’s no, like, “Whoa.” It’s just, they don’t even know what’s happening. They’re just looking at you and you’re like, “You’re not feeling any of this?” And they hit the ground so hard. It’s like they got thrown off a roof. Everybody hears it, they’re like, “What’s going on?” I’m like, “My parents are down!” “I got to get ’em up.” “My mom’s got a bruise that won’t go away for two years.” I just walk ahead of them now. I’m like a Sherpa. Just let them know the terrain that we’re about to hit. “Got a little carpet coming up.” “Got a little carpet. When we go outside, a little brighter than inside.” “Yeah, and cobblestone. You ain’t gonna make that. So…” “Lay down. Lay down on the carpet.” “I’m gonna back the car up in the building.”',\n",
              " 'We had my mom go pick up our daughter recently at a friend’s house, and I texted her the address, and she drove to the wrong house. She knocked on the door, another grandmother answered. Well, this is no good. This is like two dogs seeing each other through a fence. It’s gonna be hard to get them both back inside. So, my mom, she goes, “Is my granddaughter there?” And the other lady goes, “I have three grandsons.” No solution. Just two grandmothers. “You have… You have stuff? I have stuff too.” They talked for 30 minutes. It’s the wrong door! I had to go get my daughter, then find my mom. And wives are the ones that keep it together the longest in a relationship. If you see an old married couple, like, 80-year-old… They’re 80, the wife is just… She’s with it. And her husband’s like, “Where are we at right now?” Like, he… I mean, our brains fall off a cliff, dude. Like, they’re… The only reason he’s out is because she’s like, “You better get out and let people see you a little bit.” It’s like some zookeeper walking some old gorilla around. “Let the kids touch you.” Everybody’s trying to feed him. “Don’t feed him that.” “I think he wants it.” “He definitely wants it. He’s too dumb to know he can’t have it.” My dad goes to the hospital all the time. I mean, he… He has surgery eight times a year, probably. He loves it. He loves it. The doctor will go, “Look, you could just stretch.” And he goes, “Let’s just do the surgery.” He had surgery ’cause he was addicted to Afrin, the nose spray. Yeah. Look, I… I got addicted to Afrin as well. I would honestly tell you, if you don’t know what it is, I would tell you not to get involved. It’s one of the best things I’ve ever been part of. When I was on it too, my wife was furious. I had to try to hide it from her. She could hear it from three blocks away. Just one little puff, “What’s that?” “I ain’t gonna live like this!” “I ain’t work this hard not to do Afrin in my own home.” So my dad, they go to the doctor, him and my mom. And the doctor was like, “Do you use Afrin?” And my dad goes, “No.” And the doctor was like, “I can tell that you use it.” “I was just saying that.” So… He goes, “How long have you used it?” And my dad said, “Five years.” Which is a lie. And my mom, she’s like, “Well, tell the truth.” You know, she goes, “He’s used it for 45 years.” He used Afrin 45 years. Just for reference, if you don’t know, the back of the box suggests no more than three days. I mean, there’s not a medicine on Earth that tells you to give it a good 45-year run. I think about my parents a lot because, I mean, the world is getting very futuristic. And, like them, I’m from the 1900s. You got to watch out for the 1900s people. We’re old.',\n",

That’s how… That’s how good doctors were back then. They just said… They looked at her as they smoked in her face. These were real doctors. They were like, “I don’t know.” “She’s rude. I’ll tell you that.” I mean, I think what I saw growing up… I mean, we would go watch… My dad’s a magician. So we would go watch my dad do magic at the Wilson County Fair. County fairs are great. If you never… They’re still going around. I don’t think the government knows about them, but… I mean, we ride these rides that were on the interstate an hour ago. So we would go watch my dad. So my dad would do magic. Right next to him, they had a donkey jumping off a high dive into a pool. So pretty hard to keep everybody’s attention. When my dad is like, “Is this your card?” And everybody’s like, “This donkey’s about to jump off this high dive.” That’s something you don’t think you wanna see, till it’s up there. And I use the word “jump” very loosely. These donkeys are falling off this high dive. But you can’t put that on the sign, you know? “You gonna watch a donkey fall off a high dive?” “No.” “Okay.” “What if he jumped?” “Well, at least he’s into it.”',\n",
              " 'So the donkey would go up this ramp, like, 40 feet in the air. And it would just stand there ’cause it doesn’t want to jump. It’s not in on this, so… But it gets stuck ’cause donkeys can’t walk backwards. Not positive if that is true, but I… I’ve never seen a donkey go backwards. I’ve never even really looked, but I honestly think, 45 years, I would have seen a couple donkeys go backwards. So the donkey stands there, and a dog, he sends a dog up the ramp, it barks at the donkey and the donkey jumps in the pool. And as someone that has seen this, I tell you, when that donkey hits the water, you’re like, “We should probably get out of here. Uh…” It’s not as fun as you thought it would be. I mean, this is going to sound dumb, but you’re really surprised you’re seeing what the sign said you would see. PETA got a hold of that. They shut it down. And that was one I think everybody was like, “Fair enough, we get that.” Another one PETA had to shut down, this was again, like, the 1980s. I was alive. You could fight an orangutan at a fair. They would have an orangutan just sitting in a boxing ring and guys would pay to fight it. And I say “guys,” because I just can’t imagine one woman ever fought this orangutan. I think you can put an orangutan in a room with a thousand women, and when they walked out, like, “Did anybody fight it?” “It never crossed our mind to fight it.”',\n",

The other one would’ve started it, going, “I think y’all should fight that orangutan.” So, guys get in there and they’re like, “All right, we’ll go fight this orangutan.” And the orangutan would just knock everybody out. Because we don’t have the internet to look up, “How strong is an orangutan?” It’s all word-of-mouth back then. You had to meet a guy that just fought an orangutan.

There’s… The first… One of the first things they had to do, car manufacturers, before crash test dummies were invented, they would use a pig in a car wreck. So they sit a pig I guess upright. And this little pig… Pigs are smart. Pretty good day for this pig. It’s like, “You gonna let me drive a car?” Pretty fun, pretty fun day. He’s got his elbow out. “Are y’all kidding me right now? You gonna let me drive this car?” I don’t even know what that shows you. Pigs don’t have necks. That’s what I was around when I was growing up. I mean, I look at my daughter, and I have more in common with a Pilgrim. And Pilgrims believed in witches. Little side note, I would like to say, I think the witch phase was the toughest phase for women to have to go through. Not to get serious, but a lot of people say voting. I disagree. I think it’s witch, then voting. I think it’s witch, pretty big gap, then, you know, voting. You jaywalk back then, the whole town’s like, “There’s a witch.” You’re like, “Here we go. Here we go!” And I’ll give it to ’em, because they could’ve flown away, but none of them ever did. [chuckles] All right, sorry. That… Look. Just trying to get a witch joke in, it’s pretty complicated. There’s a lot of moving parts. You got to bring up Pilgrims somehow. I took a typing class in seventh grade. That’s how…',\n",

The computer’s like, “No.” And I go, “What about now, though?” Hotels are getting futuristic. A lot of hotels, when I stay at, now, when you take a shower, they have half a glass. So, it’s open. So the water gets on the floor. Because that’s the future. They want water on the floor. And I’m old and dumb, I come… You know, we really tried to keep the water inside the tub. It was a pretty big deal, but now, they want the floors wet, that’s what they want. They want to do no glass, but I’m still alive, so they’re like, “All right, do half a glass.” “Once that guy’s gone, we’ll do no glass, floors are wet, drains off the balcony.” When I first started going on the road, I would have to do a wake-up call. That’s how I got up in the morning. I’d have to call a guy I don’t know, and just be like, “Will you wake me up tomorrow?”',\n",

So no one’s done a wake-up call in probably 20 years now. So this guy on the road with us, he’s 24 years old, he’s never done a wake-up call in his life. And so, we’re staying at a hotel, and he saw the wake-up call on the phone. And he goes, “I’m going to do a wake-up call.” And I told him, I go, “Don’t do it.” “I mean, that’s like an ashtray on an airplane.” He was like, “No, I want to do it.” “All right.” So he set it up. Next morning, his phone rings, he doesn’t answer the phone. He doesn’t know that’s the main part of your job. You gotta answer the phone and let the guy know you’re awake. So then that guy, who’s young too probably, is like, “I guess I got to go knock on the door.” “I’ve never even seen this service used so it must be the most important person alive.” So he goes up and he starts knocking on the door. My buddy still doesn’t answer the door. So the guy goes in the room. I swear this is real, ’cause look, this is two young people, they don’t know what they’re doing. So he goes in the room, like, “Do I have to touch this guy?” “Is that what a wake-up call is?” “I gotta touch a guy I’ve never seen, in the dark?” So I’d imagine he started making noises, just going, “Hep. Hey, now! Hep!” “Hep, hep, hep. Hep!” Hoping he doesn’t have to touch this man. But he had to touch him. I swear, that’s what he told me.

With his signature deadpan delivery, Bargatze riffs on relatable topics like pizza-ordering dilemmas, domestic quirks with his frugal wife, and parenting mishaps, weaving personal anecdotes with exaggerated humor. The show opens with a spirited introduction from his daughter, setting the stage for a performance rooted in self-deprecating humor, small-town nostalgia, and sharp observations about modern absurdities. Bargatze’s storytelling shines as he recounts his days as a water meter reader, his failed attempts to manage daily routines without his wife’s guidance, and his humorous take on aging and familial dynamics. The special thrives on Bargatze’s ability to find comedy in the mundane, whether it’s debating the dominance of dogs sleeping in beds or lamenting the complexities of fast-food drive-throughs. His observations on generational quirks, from his parents’ idiosyncrasies to his own aging mishaps, resonate universally. The show crescendos with his musings on societal advancements, juxtaposed with his small-town upbringing, culminating in laugh-out-loud reflections on AI, modern hotels, and outdated services like wake-up calls. Through it all, Bargatze maintains a warm and engaging rapport with his audience, delivering a feel-good hour of humor that blends sharp wit with heartfelt relatability. * * * [crowd cheering] [“Sunday Best” by Surfaces playing] Please welcome my daddy, Nate Bargatze! ♪ Feeling good, like I should ♪ [crowd cheering] ♪ Went and took a walk Around the neighborhood ♪ ♪ Feeling blessed, never stressed ♪ ♪ Got that sunshine On my Sunday best, yeah… ♪ I love you. ♪ Every day can be a better day Despite the challenge ♪ ♪ All you gotta do is leave it Better than you found it ♪ ♪ It’s gonna get difficult to stand But hold your balance ♪ ♪ I just say whatever ‘Cause there is no way around it ♪ Thank you.

Thank you. That’s very nice. [crowd whooping] This is it. We’re doing it. Uh… So… My… I love… Look, I love doing stand-up comedy. I love it. And the job I had, the last serious job, the job I will go back to when all this falls apart… [crowd laughing] I was a water meter reader. [scattered cheering] Thank you. This job was… The title was the description of what you do. [crowd laughing] People would ask, I’d go, “I’m a water meter reader.” “Yeah, what’s that?” Let me tell you what it is, all right? We’re going to read water meters. That’s the… That’s 100% of the job. So back when I did it, it was in Wilson County, Mt. Juliet, Tennessee. And so, back when I did it, I would have to park the truck, and like get out in the neighborhood. Like, run through a neighborhood, and type in how much water every house uses. So it’s 2001. Obviously, 9/11 happens. If you’re old enough, you remember when 9/11 happened, the whole country got very scared there was going to be more attacks. Well, we did as well in Wilson County. We figured, they just went to New York, obvious next stop, Mt. Juliet, Tennessee. [crowd laughing] And they are going to poison our town’s water. So they got all of us water meter readers to guard the water tanks. I really did this. I stood… just in a dark field, alone, waiting for the Taliban to show up. No weapons, no training. They gave us a lantern. A lantern! That does nothing but shows your body as you hold it up. I can’t see two feet in front of me. If someone’s got a gun, they’re like, “Shoot at the only light in that field.” I’m going to put it over my heart to see. I’m like, “What’s going on?” I mean, I think, like, to this day, I’ve always said, what did they want us to do? Call the Mt. Juliet Police? “Osama is here.” “He got past our lanterns.” “He’s in the water tank. He knew how to open that. We were…” “We were surprised by that, but he knew what he was doing.” My wife was with me when I had that job. She’s been with me way before where we’re at right now. She was in it for the benefits I got at the water company. Uh… [Nate chuckles] We have, uh… So we’ve been married 17 years. [crowd cheering] Thank you. And, uh, I know… You know, the longer I’m married, the more I realize why she was put in my life. I would not be here if she was not in my life. I know all of this. Now, I’ve also become very reliant on her because of this. I don’t know anything about me. Like… I don’t know what I like and don’t like to eat. [crowd laughing] I mean, someone would be like, “You want to try this?” And I got to get her involved. I’m like, “I don’t think so.” I don’t know how long to microwave something. I have to ask her every time, as if her family invented the microwave. “How long do we microwave this for?” And she’s like, “Do it till it’s hot.” It’s like, “But I know you know a number. You know, just…” “Just say the number. I don’t…” “I’m either gonna call my mom, or you’re gonna tell me the number.” If she doesn’t tell me, I type in 90 minutes and I walk away. [Nate laughs] I do do my own laundry. [crowd cheering] Thanks. Thank you. I think that’s what it deserves. My mom did my dad’s laundry growing up, so I thought all wives do husbands’ laundry. And I’ve always done my own, and to be honest, I felt it had been forgotten about over these past 17 years. The sacrifice I was making that other husbands didn’t have to make. One day, I was driving home and it popped in my head, and I was like, “All right, I’ll bring that up.” I mean, I didn’t bring it up that day, you know? I was like, I’m sure there will be a time where we’ll be in some fight, I’ll be losing this fight… and then, I mean, I just come, I’m like, “I do my own laundry!” She’s like, “Fight’s over!” “You win. I forgot how good I got it.” So I sit on it for, like, six months, like a long… [laughs] We finally get in a fight. I don’t remember what the fight was about. Nothing. I don’t know. It wasn’t laundry. I remember that. So, I’m losing this fight. And so, in my head I’m like, “This is it.” I mean, honestly, I was sad to see it go. That’s how good I felt. I felt bad for her. I mean… I was like, “She thinks she’s winning this fight.” “I’m about to drop a bomb on her right now.” [crowd laughing] So just out of nowhere, I just go, “I do my own laundry!” And I said it like, “They don’t make them like this no more.” I was shocked that it started a second fight I never saw coming. [crowd laughing, applauding] [Nate laughs] Thanks. We do laundry very differently. She’ll read the labels, I’ll wash a rug and a suit together. I’m… I don’t know. “You wanna put your shoes in there? Put your shoes.” The washing machine’s always a foot from the wall when I get done. [chuckles] It’s like, “That was a lot of stuff you put in there.” You know? Yeah. “And look, it’s almost all wet.” I travel a lot. Obviously. So she’ll be at home with our daughter. We have a wonderful daughter, as you have seen. And… [crowd cheering] But I know it’s hard. You know, she’s home, my wife has to be the mom and the dad, and the good and the bad parent. You know, and I come home and I’m super fun. Or I’ll mess up the routine. This is just stuff she tells me. And… [crowd laughing] Like, I’ll go… When I go home, I’ll lay in bed with our daughter and then we get in trouble for talking. I’m not the one talking, by the way. But we get yelled at as if I’m the one talking. I do get it, because I don’t think of the consequences with everything. Like, we have one dog. I would like another dog. My wife does not want another dog, because it’s a lot. It’s a lot to have two dogs, ’cause you got to open the back door and let two dogs out. [crowd laughing] Then you shut it, and now… now they’re out there. You’re inside, not dealing with it, but… But then they want to come back in and you’re like, [grumpily] “Got to go let all these dogs back in.” You’re like, “One dog, two… Look at all these dogs everywhere.” Look, I… To be honest, I’ve never taken care of the one dog we have, but… Two? Two would be fun. Our dog sleeps in our bed, and someone told me you’re not supposed to do that, ’cause you lose dominance over the dog. And, you know, I asked him, I said, “What year do you think it is?” These are all doodles. They’re barely dogs. It’s a person. They’re people. This guy acts like it’s 1980 when you kept the dog outside all year. Those, you needed dominance over. You had a wolf in the backyard. Friends come over. “You want to go outside?” “I wouldn’t.” She’s the cheaper one of us, as well. Not in a bad way, you know. She likes the lights being off. Turn the lights off, you know, save money. Turn the… Get the lights. All the lights off, it’s a fun time, being in that environment. Turn the light on, find your seat. Get a stick, knock the light back off. Sit in the dark and be sad and just be… just sad all day. But you’re saving nickels upon nickels. Right when I get in bed, “You turn that light off?” “I can’t tell if that’s on.” “Well, get out of bed, turn it off.” Eighty years, we’ll give our daughter the $37 from all the nickels we saved. All right, look, I can be wasteful. Like, if something gets to the bottom, I will throw it away. Ketchup. If ketchup gets, like, that much left, I’m like, “Bleh.” She will put the old ketchup with the new ketchup. That way your ketchup’s always gross. [crowd laughing] Toothpaste. I will use it to what I think the average person uses it to. I don’t think I should feel muscles trying to get it out. I’m not going to have an iron on top of it. But she’ll do it more. So I know when I’m done with it, I give it to the hobo I married. She cuts it, gets it all out. I married an old man from the Depression, is who I married. She would have thrived during the Depression. I don’t think she would’ve known there was a Depression. A pizza party is my nightmare. I’ll have friends over for pizza. So I’ll be like, “All right, we gotta order pizza.” And she goes, “How much?” I go, “Order the most.” “I don’t want to run out of pizza in front of my friends.” She goes, “Just call and ask them.” I go, “I can’t call these 40-year-old dudes and just be like, ‘How much pizza do you think you’re gonna eat tonight?'” They have a real… They have a family. They work in a building, right now. You want me to call and be like, “You have a big lunch today?” “No, we’re trying to save money, so I need to know exactly how much pizza you’re going to eat in eight hours.” I just want to buy stuff and her not know I bought it, and… that’s so hard. I think if I knew the name of my bank, I could do it. But I got to go through her to get that information. I poke around, I’ll be like, “If I had a bank, what bank do you think I would go to?” I also, once a week, walk into a bank and go, “Hello, is my money in this bank?” She has to get me out of stuff all the time. If I buy something and it doesn’t fit, I’ll never take it back. I’m embarrassed. I’m pretty sure it’s going to be the exact same people. And they remember me. And right when I walk in, they’ll be like, “We knew you couldn’t handle that shirt.” She takes back groceries to the grocery store. [incredulously] Yeah. Food. I… Honestly, I don’t think it’s allowed. I… Honest. I think she’s bullying these 15-year-old children. They don’t know what to do. Their mom walks in being like, “Your bananas got weird too quick.” And they’re like, “What?” “You picked them out. They’re not mine. What are you talking about?” “I’m gonna change them. I’mma go change them out.” “Yeah, that lady is stealing bananas.” Recently, I was walking to my car and I had a college kid come up and he was raising money, uh… You know, for nature. Or it was for Earth. It was nature and Earth. Uh… I don’t know. He used real words. But it was, you know, basically… I felt he even looked at me, like, “It’s going to Earth.” I was like, “Yeah. Well, Earth is going through it right now.” So… He was telling me everything Earth is going through. You know, it’s pollution. He said, “Our water’s being poisoned.” You know, I said, “Not under my watch, but I understand.” [crowd laughing, cheering] I think I was buying a tree, I don’t really know. But I tried to give him cash and he was like, “Oh, you got to do a credit card.” I was like, “Okay.” So, I give a random iPad all my family information. It was $75. So he, like, swipes the card, and then after it goes through, he goes, “Just so you know, it’s a monthly charge.” [crowd gasps] Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah. He told me after. And he was like, “Look, you can cancel it on the website.” I was like, “I don’t know what’s going on right now.” He goes, “Put your email down for the receipt.” I was like, “All right.” I just put my wife’s email address down. Guess who’s going to put a stop to this real fast? [crowd laughing, cheering] She’ll have that tree cut down tomorrow. I called her, ’cause I have to call her when I sign us up for stuff, and… [chuckles] She answered the phone, just goes, “I’m on it.” Hung up. She runs everything. She does stuff, doesn’t tell me. We got a new roof, and I did not know that. A whole new roof, I found out from my neighbors. They were like, “How’s that new roof going?” I go, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” And they go, “You didn’t know you got a new roof?” I go, “No, I did not.” And then I had to go get her, I was like, “You gotta go talk about that new roof you didn’t tell me about.” “I looked like an idiot out there.” We live… So, in our neighborhood, we live in a cul-de-sac, which is very exciting, because I grew up on a straight street… and I always dreamed of living in a cul-de-sac. You see them and you’re like, “Can you imagine being up in one of those?” We do all the cul-de-sac stuff, you know. Like, if anybody comes down there, we’re like, “What are you doing down…” Just, any car. We’re like, “You better get out of our cul-de-sac.” We take our trash out, uh… one of the days. I don’t know the day, but it’s a day. We’re doing it. There is one day. I know we forgot to take it out a couple weeks ago. That stress could break up a family. All week was like, “Everybody, eat out of your hands.” We had friends over, “Put your trash in your pockets, take it to your homes.” We got very lucky with our neighbors. Our neighbors are super cool, and we’re very close with them. Uh, they all have real jobs. They, like, went to college and stuff. And… one of them is a management consultant, so he manages all the consultants and… Yeah, it’s a tough job. All right? There’s a lot of consultants and he’s like, “You better get back.” You know? “You can’t…” “Just can’t consult up in here.” So, he’s busy. Our other neighbor’s an actuary. I thought that was with birds. I was like, “What’s that bird right there?” He goes, “I don’t know.” And I was like… [crowd laughing, cheering] “As an actuary, you don’t know what that bird is right there?” I went to career day for my daughter’s school, and, like, I get what I do is very fun, but I was nervous, ’cause I’m there with real people and they’re smart, and… So I was hoping to sit at a table alone. They put me at a table with a surgeon. Which I… I think they did it on purpose. Almost to show the kids, “Here’s the difference between reading.” [crowd laughing, cheering] So the kids, like, come up, you know, and they’re like, “What subjects do you use for comedy?” And I was like, I don’t even know what subjects they’re taking. Uh… I was like, “I do English. I do mostly English onstage.” They asked him, “How long do you go to school to be a surgeon?” You know, and he’s like, “54 years,” or whatever. It’s like… They asked me, they’re like, “How long to be a comedian?” I was like, “You’re good now.” So… “Look, finish elementary school, make your parents happy, but then I’d get out and get after it.” I had a hard time in school. There was… I got… I barely graduated, got into a community college, barely got into a college they have to let everybody in. I went to community college for one year, I have zero credits. Community college, a lot of people don’t know, is college when they’re like, “You’re probably going to stay in your community. So…” “We’re just going to show you the ropes around town.” “Kind of give you a lay of the land.” That whole year, I don’t have credits, because I had to take remedial classes. Which remedial is basically for… They’re classes for someone my age now trying to go back to school because they don’t remember school. And I took them right out of school. I just… They’re like, “You don’t remember school?” I was like, “I just came from school.” They go, “It looks like you’ve never heard about it.” Everybody in there was, like, 50. I’m like, “Well, who’s the teacher?” “I think you have to tell me if I ask. Who’s the teacher?” I took such basic… I took Speech. In college. I’d go… I would ride there with my friends, going to a business class or something. Whatever you go to. I was like, “All right, I’ll catch you after Speech.” And I still say a lot of words wrong, that’s what I don’t understand. I say, uh, “Poim.” “Poim.” Which no one ever knows. Uh, poem. Like… Yeah. P-O-E-M. I go, “poim.” Well, fix that, Speech class. What if I want to be a “poim” writer? What if I have a lot of great “poim” ideas? And no one takes me serious, ’cause I’m like, “Listen to my poims.” “Ol.” I say, “Ol.” A super Southern one. Uh… Oil. I don’t even know how to say it. Like, to y’all. Oil. O-I-L. Yeah. Yes. [laughs] I go, “Motor ol.” Like, “Tinfol.” I mean, Southern community college, that should be mandatory that they fix that. They should write O-I-L on the board, and I just go, “Ol.” They go, “We’re gonna take care of that. All right?” “There’s a pretty good chance you’re gonna be working with a lot of that.” “Silver War.” That’s how I say it. Instead of “Civil.” I go, “Silver War.” Because… You know? Look, that might be on me. All right? I’m not… I’ll tell you, I don’t even know anything about the “Silver War.” I don’t know anything about history. And I can tell, because every history movie I watch, I watch on the edge of my seat. [laughing, applause] “What is gonna happen?” I watched Pearl Harbor. I was just as surprised as they were, you know? I don’t read. Yeah, and I think that matters. Reading is the key to smart, I believe. And… I don’t do it. I think it’s caught up to me. I want to do it. I like the idea of reading. I even buy books, but these books are the most words. And… It’s every book. You just open it and you’re like, “What are you talking about?” It… I mean… And they don’t let up. Every page, just more words. How about you put some blank pages in there? Why don’t you let me get my head above water for two seconds? [crowd laughing, applauding] My eyes can read good. It’s my brain. My eyes are such good readers. I feel so bad, ’cause they’re attached to this dumb brain. I mean, they’re looking at these words, they’re like, “You’re not getting any of this, man?” “That’s the fifth time we’ve read that sentence. Let’s try another one.” Fiction, non-fiction. I don’t know which one’s the truth. I read every book as the truth is how I handle it. From what I can tell, we have a pretty big wizard problem in this country right now. We went to… Like, we went to Europe last year. And by the way, on the way to… We were flying from Nashville to London, and we go, uh… It was 4:42 p.m. Nashville time. So as a game, as a family, I said, “Let’s guess what time it is in London.” So I said 12:42 a.m. Our daughter said 1:42 a.m. My wife, her guess was 11. And that’s it. Yeah, she didn’t say the 42. And, I was like, “Just say the 42.” She goes, “You know what I mean.” I go, “I know, but just… show our daughter you know what a normal person would say.” That started a pretty big fight. If you go to Europe, just so you know, uh… it’s the most old. It’s very old. You think we’re old, and you get there and you’re like, “Good night.” Uh… “What have y’all been doing over here?” You just walk around, they’re like, “That building is from 8.” You’re like, “Good golly.” Went to Australia as well. Australia’s very far away. I’m going to tell you, our Earth is bigger than I thought it was. We flew 16 hours, over 500 miles an hour. Barely made it. Barely. I think we went the wrong way, as well. I had jet lag there. I did not mind it, ’cause I woke up early. I woke up at 5:45 a.m., and I don’t ever wake up that early. So I was, like, first in line at the breakfast buffet. Here’s what I will tell you, when you get up at 5:45 a.m. noon is pretty far away. I mean, you will bet your life it’s noon, and it’s maybe 8:30. By 6:00 p.m., it’s like, “How are people out?” “Why won’t the sun go down?” That’s the next phase of my life, getting up early, you know? We’re starting. We get up at 9:15 a little bit. Yeah. You know. I’ve never seen my daughter go to school, but I’ve been close. I’m cold now too, that I’m old. Forty-five. I just get cold, I always have to bring a jacket. It could be 135 degrees outside and I will walk around with a jacket. And I see these young people, and I just think, “Where are your jackets?” My body’s falling apart. My… My shoulder hurts, ’cause I stand onstage like this. It’s crazy. This was a huge mistake to get into this. If I had known that this would be a big problem, I would have probably tried to not make it a habit. My body can’t handle this. And I went to the doctor to try to fix it… I mean, they talked to me like I was an old car. He goes, “I wouldn’t put any more money into it, to be honest.” I pulled a muscle recently, I guess it was in my soul. I mean, it was dead middle of my body… I thought it was the front. Then I was like, “Well, my back hurts too.” You know? So… Well, what’s in the middle? What muscle is in the middle? I went hiking. I jumped off a rock. I mean, a foot high. When I landed, it felt what I would imagine being struck by lightning feels like. I felt it through my fingernails. Fifty-fifty if my zipper’s up or down anymore. It’s a true flip of the coin. I don’t know what’s happening. I’ve zipped up my whole life. And now, just head out, like, “All right, see you boys later.” Just head out. Take my pants off at home. They come off easy. I’m like, “Ah, that was four hours I was walking around like…” I think it’s ’cause I’m peeing so much longer. And I’m not used to this new old rhythm yet. ‘Cause in your 40s, there’s a lot of false stops. You learn pretty quick to be like, “Let’s hang back.” “Let’s let traffic thin out a little bit.” I watch young people come and go. I’m like, “Tell my family I’m okay.” Food is still… I still have a problem with food. I… I love processed food. I love it. I’m a farm-factory-table guy. [crowd laughing, cheering] I want… I want the most hands involved in my food. It’s coming to an end. You can feel… I can feel it. I can’t do it anymore. It really hurts. I… You know, and I tell myself, like, “I’ve done it. I was…” Yeah, my jersey would be retired of eating fast food. I’ve done all the stuff. I’ve had Taco Bell and threw it away in my neighbor’s trash so my wife didn’t find out. I used so much ketchup once at a restaurant, that a stranger walked up to me and goes, “That’s a lot of ketchup.” Do you know how much ketchup you got to use? That guy doesn’t want to get involved, you know? But he sees it. I mean, his wife’s like, “Let it go.” He’s like, “I think I got to say something. I don’t…” “I don’t think he knows that we’re all… No one’s using that much ketchup.” I went to a McDonald’s drive-through and my window did not roll down. That’s the universe saying, “Give it a rest.” And I fought through it. It’s embarrassing, because they can tell, because I had to pull past… Because I got to open my door, so it’s going to hit the speaker. So I gotta drive by it. So the car behind me is like, “Are you leaving?” I’m like, “My window don’t roll down.” And I got to open the door. Now the speaker is by the gas tank. So I gotta yell my order out. Now that guy hears it. And then I look at McDonald’s screen, well, they got it all on the board, just let the neighborhood know what I’m ordering. And then I drove by the window, the drive-through window, and I got to go by it, ’cause I got to open my whole door. So I go by it, and I see them, they’re like, “Where are you going?” I was like, “Nowhere.” And I go by, and they see my whole body sitting in a chair. It’s crazy. If you’ve never done it, it’s the most vulnerable I ever felt in my life. Just… You’re just sitting there, and you’re like, “Hi.” They see your feet. They see your feet. They just throw it at me like a bear, just throw it. Our family, we just eat a lot of fast food. Our family text thread, my dad texted, he was like, “I found a way to get a Big Mac cheaper.” And he said, “You can order a double cheeseburger and ask for Big Mac sauce.” So he goes, “It’s cheaper, and they get rid of that third bun, so it’s Atkins.” Uh… That’s how you do it. That third bun is the one you’re like, “I don’t know if I need the third bun.” My parents are getting older, they’re not super old, but they’re at the age where, you know, if they trip, they will fall to the ground. There’s just an age where it hap… I mean… Like, if I trip, my body hasn’t touched the ground in 40 years. But for them, it’s just, I don’t know. It’s like the upper is like, “We’re going.” And… the lower is like, “What?” And it’s just… Boom. And I mean, there’s no, like, “Whoa.” It’s just, they don’t even know what’s happening. They’re just looking at you and you’re like, “You’re not feeling any of this?” And they hit the ground so hard. It’s like they got thrown off a roof. Everybody hears it, they’re like, “What’s going on?” I’m like, “My parents are down!” “I got to get ’em up.” “My mom’s got a bruise that won’t go away for two years.” I just walk ahead of them now. I’m like a Sherpa. Just let them know the terrain that we’re about to hit. “Got a little carpet coming up.” “Got a little carpet. When we go outside, a little brighter than inside.” “Yeah, and cobblestone. You ain’t gonna make that. So…” “Lay down. Lay down on the carpet.” “I’m gonna back the car up in the building.” We had my mom go pick up our daughter recently at a friend’s house, and I texted her the address, and she drove to the wrong house. She knocked on the door, another grandmother answered. Well, this is no good. This is like two dogs seeing each other through a fence. It’s gonna be hard to get them both back inside. So, my mom, she goes, “Is my granddaughter there?” And the other lady goes, “I have three grandsons.” No solution. Just two grandmothers. “You have… You have stuff? I have stuff too.” They talked for 30 minutes. It’s the wrong door! I had to go get my daughter, then find my mom. And wives are the ones that keep it together the longest in a relationship. If you see an old married couple, like, 80-year-old… They’re 80, the wife is just… She’s with it. And her husband’s like, “Where are we at right now?” Like, he… I mean, our brains fall off a cliff, dude. Like, they’re… The only reason he’s out is because she’s like, “You better get out and let people see you a little bit.” It’s like some zookeeper walking some old gorilla around. “Let the kids touch you.” Everybody’s trying to feed him. “Don’t feed him that.” “I think he wants it.” “He definitely wants it. He’s too dumb to know he can’t have it.” My dad goes to the hospital all the time. I mean, he… He has surgery eight times a year, probably. He loves it. He loves it. The doctor will go, “Look, you could just stretch.” And he goes, “Let’s just do the surgery.” He had surgery ’cause he was addicted to Afrin, the nose spray. Yeah. Look, I… I got addicted to Afrin as well. I would honestly tell you, if you don’t know what it is, I would tell you not to get involved. It’s one of the best things I’ve ever been part of. When I was on it too, my wife was furious. I had to try to hide it from her. She could hear it from three blocks away. Just one little puff, “What’s that?” “I ain’t gonna live like this!” “I ain’t work this hard not to do Afrin in my own home.” So my dad, they go to the doctor, him and my mom. And the doctor was like, “Do you use Afrin?” And my dad goes, “No.” And the doctor was like, “I can tell that you use it.” “I was just saying that.” So… He goes, “How long have you used it?” And my dad said, “Five years.” Which is a lie. And my mom, she’s like, “Well, tell the truth.” You know, she goes, “He’s used it for 45 years.” He used Afrin 45 years. Just for reference, if you don’t know, the back of the box suggests no more than three days. I mean, there’s not a medicine on Earth that tells you to give it a good 45-year run. I think about my parents a lot because, I mean, the world is getting very futuristic. And, like them, I’m from the 1900s. You got to watch out for the 1900s people. We’re old. [crowd cheering] It’s so… I mean, my great-aunt Helen from the ’30s. She’s deaf. They didn’t know she was deaf back then. The doctors, they had no idea. They were baffled. That’s how… That’s how good doctors were back then. They just said… They looked at her as they smoked in her face. These were real doctors. They were like, “I don’t know.” “She’s rude. I’ll tell you that.” I mean, I think what I saw growing up… I mean, we would go watch… My dad’s a magician. So we would go watch my dad do magic at the Wilson County Fair. County fairs are great. If you never… They’re still going around. I don’t think the government knows about them, but… I mean, we ride these rides that were on the interstate an hour ago. So we would go watch my dad. So my dad would do magic. Right next to him, they had a donkey jumping off a high dive into a pool. So pretty hard to keep everybody’s attention. When my dad is like, “Is this your card?” And everybody’s like, “This donkey’s about to jump off this high dive.” That’s something you don’t think you wanna see, till it’s up there. And I use the word “jump” very loosely. These donkeys are falling off this high dive. But you can’t put that on the sign, you know? “You gonna watch a donkey fall off a high dive?” “No.” “Okay.” “What if he jumped?” “Well, at least he’s into it.” So the donkey would go up this ramp, like, 40 feet in the air. And it would just stand there ’cause it doesn’t want to jump. It’s not in on this, so… But it gets stuck ’cause donkeys can’t walk backwards. Not positive if that is true, but I… I’ve never seen a donkey go backwards. I’ve never even really looked, but I honestly think, 45 years, I would have seen a couple donkeys go backwards. So the donkey stands there, and a dog, he sends a dog up the ramp, it barks at the donkey and the donkey jumps in the pool. And as someone that has seen this, I tell you, when that donkey hits the water, you’re like, “We should probably get out of here. Uh…” It’s not as fun as you thought it would be. I mean, this is going to sound dumb, but you’re really surprised you’re seeing what the sign said you would see. PETA got a hold of that. They shut it down. And that was one I think everybody was like, “Fair enough, we get that.” Another one PETA had to shut down, this was again, like, the 1980s. I was alive. You could fight an orangutan at a fair. They would have an orangutan just sitting in a boxing ring and guys would pay to fight it. And I say “guys,” because I just can’t imagine one woman ever fought this orangutan. I think you can put an orangutan in a room with a thousand women, and when they walked out, like, “Did anybody fight it?” “It never crossed our mind to fight it.” [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Put three men in that room, two of those men will fight that orangutan. The other one would’ve started it, going, “I think y’all should fight that orangutan.” So, guys get in there and they’re like, “All right, we’ll go fight this orangutan.” And the orangutan would just knock everybody out. Because we don’t have the internet to look up, “How strong is an orangutan?” It’s all word-of-mouth back then. You had to meet a guy that just fought an orangutan. You’re like, “But the arms are skinny.” He’s like, “I know. That’s what made me get in there as well.” [crowd laughing, applauding] So PETA put a stop to that also. Yeah. Look, whatever you want to say about PETA, they did some real work in the 1900s. There’s… The first… One of the first things they had to do, car manufacturers, before crash test dummies were invented, they would use a pig in a car wreck. So they sit a pig I guess upright. And this little pig… Pigs are smart. Pretty good day for this pig. It’s like, “You gonna let me drive a car?” Pretty fun, pretty fun day. He’s got his elbow out. “Are y’all kidding me right now? You gonna let me drive this car?” I don’t even know what that shows you. Pigs don’t have necks. That’s what I was around when I was growing up. I mean, I look at my daughter, and I have more in common with a Pilgrim. And Pilgrims believed in witches. Little side note, I would like to say, I think the witch phase was the toughest phase for women to have to go through. Not to get serious, but a lot of people say voting. I disagree. I think it’s witch, then voting. I think it’s witch, pretty big gap, then, you know, voting. You jaywalk back then, the whole town’s like, “There’s a witch.” You’re like, “Here we go. Here we go!” And I’ll give it to ’em, because they could’ve flown away, but none of them ever did. [chuckles] All right, sorry. That… Look. Just trying to get a witch joke in, it’s pretty complicated. There’s a lot of moving parts. You got to bring up Pilgrims somehow. I took a typing class in seventh grade. That’s how… [crowd applauding, whooping] And I thought it was a waste of my time. I… In my head, I was like, “Who’s going to be typing?” “Cursive is the future.” [crowd laughing, applauding] That’s why I… ‘Cause the future… I don’t know what’s going… I don’t know technology. I don’t know what AI is. I don’t think you get to know what AI is and also see a donkey jump off a high dive. I think it was one or the other, and I saw the donkey, so I’m out. If I send an email and it says the file is too big, I don’t know what to do. My best guess is… I try to resend it. That’s what I try to… You know how dumb that is? The computer’s like, “No.” And I go, “What about now, though?” Hotels are getting futuristic. A lot of hotels, when I stay at, now, when you take a shower, they have half a glass. So, it’s open. So the water gets on the floor. Because that’s the future. They want water on the floor. And I’m old and dumb, I come… You know, we really tried to keep the water inside the tub. It was a pretty big deal, but now, they want the floors wet, that’s what they want. They want to do no glass, but I’m still alive, so they’re like, “All right, do half a glass.” “Once that guy’s gone, we’ll do no glass, floors are wet, drains off the balcony.” When I first started going on the road, I would have to do a wake-up call. That’s how I got up in the morning. I’d have to call a guy I don’t know, and just be like, “Will you wake me up tomorrow?” [crowd laughing, applauding] That’s the last person I would talk to, was him. I would call my wife, then a man I’ve never seen. “You promise you gonna wake me up tomorrow?” We would tell each other good night. So no one’s done a wake-up call in probably 20 years now. So this guy on the road with us, he’s 24 years old, he’s never done a wake-up call in his life. And so, we’re staying at a hotel, and he saw the wake-up call on the phone. And he goes, “I’m going to do a wake-up call.” And I told him, I go, “Don’t do it.” “I mean, that’s like an ashtray on an airplane.” He was like, “No, I want to do it.” “All right.” So he set it up. Next morning, his phone rings, he doesn’t answer the phone. He doesn’t know that’s the main part of your job. You gotta answer the phone and let the guy know you’re awake. So then that guy, who’s young too probably, is like, “I guess I got to go knock on the door.” “I’ve never even seen this service used so it must be the most important person alive.” So he goes up and he starts knocking on the door. My buddy still doesn’t answer the door. So the guy goes in the room. I swear this is real, ’cause look, this is two young people, they don’t know what they’re doing. So he goes in the room, like, “Do I have to touch this guy?” “Is that what a wake-up call is?” “I gotta touch a guy I’ve never seen, in the dark?” So I’d imagine he started making noises, just going, “Hep. Hey, now! Hep!” “Hep, hep, hep. Hep!” Hoping he doesn’t have to touch this man. But he had to touch him. I swear, that’s what he told me. He woke up to another guy going, “Hey, buddy.” “It’s time to wake up.” Thank you so much.

Actor Jamie Foxx is asking for prayers as the actor has now spent more than two weeks in an Atlanta hospital. Foxx literally died and had to be revived. That’s what the health emergency was. Somebody in the clone department gettin’ lazy, bro. It’s not Jamie Foxx. My gut feeling is telling me that Jamie Foxx is dead. [distorted] Dead. Dead. Dead.

And all the time! [crowd] God is good! Man, I ain’t gonna make it through this shit. [crowd cheers] Atlanta saved my life. [crowd cheers] Atlanta saved my life. The internet tried to kill me, though. [crowd jeers] [Jamie] They said I was paralyzed. [man] That’s right. Said I couldn’t walk. But look at me now.

[woman laughs] [crowd cheers] [sighs] Atlanta saved my life. [audience cheers] The internet was trying to kill me, though. [crowd murmurs] The internet said that Puffy tried to kill me. [crowd jeers] That’s what the internet was saying. I know what you’re thinking, “Did-he?” [all laughing] Hell naw, n*gga. I left them parties early. I was out by nine, n*gga. “Somethin’ don’t look right, n*gga.” “It’s slippery in here, n*gga.” [crowd gasps and laughs] Atlanta saved my life. [crowd cheers] The internet tried to kill me. Katt Williams! [audience jeers] Katt Williams got in on it. Did y’all see the special? Katt Williams said he knew. [imitating Katt] “Jamie Foxx got so much money.” “They say he’s sufferin’ from a mystery illness.” “A mystery illness?” “What the ♪ Fuck?” ♪ That shit sound just like that, n*gga. [crowd cheers] That n*gga said… “Goddamn, that sound… [imitating Katt, dramatically] …a mystery illness.” “What the fuck?” [scoffs] That n*gga turned into the Wicked Witch of the West. [imitates Wicked Witch] “A mystery illness.” “I’ll get you my little Jamie and your little dog Toto too.” [cackles] [crowd laughs] Katt will say 2,000 things that don’t make sense, right? But then say four things that make sense and put “sir” after it. “The glass is half full, sir. I just filled it to the top, sir.” [crowd laughs] “Man goes to bed with an itchy ass, he wakes up with a smelly finger, sir.” [audience chuckles] [Jamie] I know, man. Y’all know me, man. And I’m so glad to see y’all here. I’m so glad to be here. [audience cheers] This is what I needed, man. You got a lot of people that prayed to make sure I was here. [audience] Yes. Yes. And I appreciate every prayer, man. Now, what’s interesting is Katt Williams might be onto something. Because it is a mystery. [clicks tongue] We still don’t know exactly what happened to me. [sighs] All I can tell you is that I appreciate every prayer. Because I needed… every prayer. I appreciate every well-wish, Atlanta. Uh… to the world, I… I can’t thank you enough, even when I see people on the street, and they roll their window down and yell out, “Man, we glad you here.” As I look out, and I see my family and I… see my friends. [clicks tongue] I can’t tell you how good it feels. If you could see it through here… it feels amazing. [crowd cheers] It actually happened here in Atlanta. A little history, Atlanta, I started doing stand-up comedy back in 1991, right here in Atlanta. So it’s fitting that I came back here to tell you, uh, the story because… what had happened was… [clicks tongue] [sighs, exhales deeply] [sniffles] [woman 1] We love you. [woman 2] Atlanta saved your life. Hey, hello. You did. [crying] Wow. Man, please, Lord. Let me get through this. [crowd cheers] Please. [woman 3] All right, you got it! You got it! [cheering continues] April 11th, I was having a bad headache, and I asked my boy for a aspirin, and I realized quickly that when you in a medical emergency, your boys don’t know what the fuck to do. And I was like, “Damn.” But I was having such a bad headache. So, I asked my boy, I said, “Listen, I need a… a… a aspirin.” Before I could get the aspirin… [ominous tones play] [clicks tongue] …I went out. [sniffles] [music fades] I don’t, um… I don’t remember 20 days. [woman 1] Oh, man. [audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What they told me was, was that… [clicks tongue]…they took me to the first doctor. And that doctor just gave me a cortisone shot and sent me home. [crowd murmurs] Yeah, I don’t know… What the fuck is that? [crowd chuckles] I don’t know if you can do Yelps… [audience chuckles] …for doctors, man. That’s half a star, n*gga. [audience laughs] You know? “No, he good. Give him that.” Man, what the fuck? But my sister… said, “No.” [woman] All right. Four foot 11… of nothin’ but pure love said that something’s wrong with my brother. She came over to see me, and I was… They told me I was leth… lethargic. And she says, “Get him in the car. That ain’t my brother right there.” My little sister who’s always played the background, now gotta play the lead. [man] Amen. [inhales sharply] They say she drove around Atlanta, sorta aimlessly. She didn’t really know where the hospitals was. But as she was drivin’ around, she came up on Piedmont Hospital. Give it up for Piedmont. [crowd cheering] What’s interesting about it is that as she drove around, she didn’t know anything about Piedmont Hospital, but she had a hunch that some angels is in there. [woman 1] Mm-hmm. [crowd murmurs in agreement] ‘Cause she said, “That’s what we gon’ need.” [scattered applause] [man 1] All right. [woman 2 whoops] [man 2] Yes! [woman 3] Hallelujah! [woman 4] Love you. Love you. [woman 5] Atlanta saved your life! Atlanta saved my life. [crowd cheering] So they tell me my sister took me into the hospital. And this cool white boy, Dr. Schuette… Cool white boy. They say he had on a Laker jersey. Just cool as shit, you know? But… he told my sister some horrible news about… her big brother. He said… “He’s havin’ a brain bleed… [audience murmurs] [Jamie sighs] …that’s led to a stroke.” [clicks tongue] Damn. [emotionally] Me. Me, man. Me. [softly] Wow. Here’s the thing. When you dream about what you want to be in life, you don’t dream tragedy. [crowd] No. You dream everything is good. “I… I got the life. I got the cars.” “I got all that.” [sniffles] You don’t dream that something would go wrong. But when something does go wrong… you need a sister. Four foot 11. [crowd] Mm-hmm. Full of nothin’ but love. [audience cheers and applauds] [sighs, sniffles] The cool doctor with the Laker jersey, white dude, said, “Listen.” “He’s havin’ this brain bleed that led to a stroke, and if I don’t go in his head right now, we’re gonna lose him.” [audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What I was told was my sister fired right back and said, “You can go in his head, but you ain’t gonna find nothin’.” [audience laughs] He said, “Why you say that?” She said, “Have you seen how big this n*gga’s head is?” [audience laughs] My sister made a joke because sometimes you gotta laugh… [crowd] To keep from crying. …to keep from cryin’. [crowd murmurs in agreement, applauds] [cheering] What actually happened was the doctor said, “If I don’t go in his head, we’re gonna lose him, and she fired back and said, “You can go in his head, but you’re not gonna find anything ’cause I already talked to God.” [woman 1] That’s right. [crowd cheers] The cool white doctor, named Dr. Schuette, shot right back and said, “I’m a religious man too.” [woman 2 whoops] [woman 3] All right. But I gotta do my job. [woman 3] All right. So, what I was told is that they take me in to operate on me, and, uh, my sister knelt down outside the operating room and prayed the whole time. [woman 3] All right. [quietly] Your life doesn’t flash before your face. It was kinda… oddly peaceful. I say this all the time. I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. I didn’t see the light. [audience chuckles] I was in a tunnel, though. It was hot in that tunnel. [woman 1] Ooh! [audience murmurs and chuckles] [laughing] [audience murmurs] Shit, am I goin’ to the wrong place in this motherfucka? ‘Cause I looked at the end of the tunnel, and I thought I saw the devil. Like, “Come on, n*gga.” [audience chuckles] Or was that Puffy? [audience gasps and laughs] [Jamie] I’m fuckin’ around. But if it was Puffy, he had a flamin’ bottle of Johnson &… No, I’m just kiddin’. [imitating Puffy] “Come on in!” No, I’m just kidding. [laughter dies down] No, I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. [clicks tongue] But my sister… [sniffles] …prayed the whole time. And when that cool white dude… [sniffles] …Dr. Schuette came out, he said, “Well, um, you was right.” “Your prayers are answered. We didn’t find where it was comin’ from.” “But he is havin’ a stroke.” “He may be able to make a full recovery.” “But it’s gonna be the worst year of his life.” [sniffles] That’s what it was, Atlanta. You finally got the story. [man] Amen. [clicks tongue] [woman] Saved your life! Saved my life. [crowd cheers] That’s why this moment is the most incredible moment. ‘Cause you do take it for granted. [sniffles] But I’mma tell you something about my sister, Deidra Dixon, and my daughter Corinne Marie Foxx. [dramatically] They held me the fuck down! [audience cheers] “Nobody sees him!” They cut it all off. [crowd cheers] They held it down. They didn’t want you to see me like that. I didn’t want you to see me like that. I want you to see me like this. [crowd] Yeah! [audience cheers] There’s another reason too why my daughter didn’t want nobody to see me ’cause I was dizzy from the… the stroke. I was so dizzy. So, my head would do this. [crowd laughs] Stop… Stop laughing. Laugh. Go ahead, n*gga. I understand. But she says, “They gon’ meme the fuck outta this motherfucker.” [crowd laughs] ‘Cause I was doing that. [laughs] But now I have a better appreciation when I see people out and they doing this. I be like, “Oh, I know what that is. What’s up?” [crowd laughs] “What’s up with you?” “What’s up? Just chillin’.” “Just hangin’ out. What’s new?” I know. It’s fucked up, right? [audience chuckles] Yeah. [chuckles die down] [woman] You look good! [Jamie] Thank you so much. I feel good. [audience cheers] Twenty days I don’t remember. [sniffles] But on May 4th… [crowd] Yeah? I woke up. [snaps] [crowd cheers] And when I woke up, I found myself in a wheelchair. I couldn’t walk. [audience groans] Couldn’t walk, bro. In a wheelchair, and I was like, “What the fuck is…?” “Why am I in a wheelchair?” I’m just coming out of some shit. I looked at Dave Brown. I said, “What am I doin’ in a wheelchair?” He said, “Foxx, you don’t remember?” “No! Why?” “What y’all doin’?” He said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” [clicks tongue] “Dave, knock it off. Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.” [audience chuckles] He said, “You don’t remember?” “I don’t remember, but I know Jamie Foxx ain’t got no stroke.” “‘Cause I’m Jamie Foxx. Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx.” [audience laughs] He said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” “And don’t try to get out of that chair, ’cause you can’t walk.” I said, “N*gga…” [hesitates] “Shit!” [audience laughs] “What the fuck you do to my legs, Dave?” I said, “Dave…” [splutters] “What’s going on, man?” He said, “Foxx, it’s real.” “Come on, Dave, man. That’s a horrible joke.” [man 1] You right! I said, “Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.” [sighs] [crying] “It’s a bad joke, Dave.” [sniffles] “I don’t get strokes. Come on, man.” [audience murmurs sympathetically] [man 2] We love you, man. I love you back. [audience cheers] [quietly] “I don’t get strokes. I don’t get strokes.” “That’s old man shit, man. I don’t get no strokes, n*gga.” Stop this fucking… prank. [sniffles] [clicks tongue, sniffles] They flew me to Chicago for my rehab. Chi-town. [audience cheers] Right there. They took care of me. Shirley Ryan, right over there. [audience cheering] Took care of me. [clicks tongue] But when I got to the rehab, there was this lady that was all over me. She was all over me, brushin’ my teeth, and… and… and… and washing my face, fixin’ my clothes, pushin’ my wheelchair. And I’m like, “Damn…” [mumbles] [audience laughs] “Who is this bitch all over me, man?” “She all over me, n*gga. She all over me, n*gga.” I said, “Dave, is she a fan? Did she see Django? Like, what? Shit.” “Why she all over me like this, dawg?” And Dave says something that stopped me in my tracks. He says, “Foxx, that’s your nurse.” I said, “What kind of old man shit is that?” So, the first night, she says, “Okay. Time for the showers.” I say, “Okay. Somebody put me in the chair, get me to the water, I’ll knock it out.” She says, “No, I’m gonna bathe you.” I said, “No, the fuck you ain’t.” She says, “Well… “I say, “No, no, no.” “You not finna… No. You not finna see this pickle.” [audience laughs] She said, “What you mean?” I say, “Uh-uh. It’s…” “Why?” I said, “No. ‘Cause there’s shit goes along with this pickle.” “I’m Black.” [audience laughs] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “It’s a whole lot of shit goin’ on here with this pickle.” “I just can’t let you see this pickle just on… out the package that quick.” [audience laughs] I said, “There’s something wrong with it. I don’t know if it’s been cold.” Fellas, you know how it is. You don’t ever take your pants off right away in front of your girl. You gotta… pump some oil in that motherfucker. Your girl… Ever pull your drawers up? “Bitch. Hold on!” [crowd laughs] “What’s wrong?” “Ain’t nothin’ in this motherfucker yet.” And that shit be stuck to your thighs. She’s like, “Are you okay?” “No! You got to give me a three count.” [audience laughs] “Give me a three count before you expose my pickle like that.” I gotta… You know… That bitch… Even if we ain’t finna fuck, it gotta have a certain… [inhales sharply] So, I’m sayin’ this to the lady. I said, “You can’t see my pickle,” and she hit me with some crazy shit. She said, “J, you don’t remember, do you?” “What?” “I’ve been bathing you for the past month and a half.” [audience exclaims, laughs] [imitating Katt Williams] I said, “Mystery illness?” [audience laughs] “What the fuck?” She been bathing me for a month and a half. I said, “You been in there?” She says, “All in there.” Goddamn! – “All in there?” [emphatically] “Yes, all in there.” [inhales sharply] Fuck! That affected me more than the stroke. I’m like, “Damn, is my dick dead?” [crowd laughs] “Because I need my dick!” [audience laughs] But, yeah. She said she’d been all in there, and then I asked a silly question. I said, “Well, was I representin’?” [audience laughs] She says, “I don’t know what that means.” She don’t, but we know what that means, right, brother? I’m like, “Fuck!” [inhales sharply] “Shit!” “She’s seen it!” “And I don’t remember her seein’ it!” So it hit me. I ain’t seen my dick in 20 days. So I rush to the bathroom, pull my pants down, look down. That motherfucker had a stroke too. [audience laughs] I said, “Man, what’s wrong, n*gga?” “You tell me, n*gga, what’s wrong?” “What happened?” “I don’t know. The lights went off.” [audience laughs] “You cool?” “No, I ain’t cool!” “Did you see the nurse?” “I seen the bitch. I didn’t do nothin’.” [audience laughs] Uh… [chuckling] [clicks tongue] Then it was the process of the therapist. They’d bring therapists for my therapy, and I didn’t want to hear that shit. I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need no fuckin’ therapists. Why did this shit even happen to me? I’m Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx. So, every therapist that came in, I said, “Get the fuck out.” “I don’t want to do this shit.” I… I… I felt like, uh, Wesley Snipes in New Jack City. When he was at the table at the end and Gee Money would walk up. [as Gee] “Yo, you, Nino.” [as Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] “Huh.” “Is that what this is about? Over a fucking skeezer?” “I don’t give a shit about that ho bitch.” [crowd laughs] [scoffs] “Yeah, yeah.” “Don’t nobody know nothing, huh? Hmm, well, I’ll be goddamned.” “Huh. Hmm. Ha. Huh.” [audience laughs] [as Gee] “If you’d have been…” [as Nino] “What?” “If I’d have been what?!” “That’s what I thought you said. ‘Cause that’s all I got.” “Nothin’!” [audience laughs and cheers] “Now, leave me.” [imitating Gee] “Yo, Nino.” [imitating Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] That’s my movie. [chuckles] Remember the old dude? [imitating Bill Cobbs] “Your soul is required in hell, young man.” “Look at you in here, sellin’ drugs to your own people.” [chuckles, imitating Nino] “Cancel this bitch. I’ll buy me another one.” “Sit your five-dollar ass down…” [crowd] “Before I make change!” [Jamie] That’s my audience. That’s Atlanta! Huh. Yeah. [crowd cheers] I was Wesley Snipes. I was arrogant. “I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need nothin’. I don’t want to see no therapist.” They say, “You got a second chance.” “I don’t want a second chance.” “What’s wrong with my first chance?” What’s wrong with my first chance? So, I was… irreverent. I was… I gave up. [sniffles] Then… I heard in the other part of the room… I heard ’em go, “We need Holly.” [audience chuckles] Who the fuck is that? “We need Holly for this one. Only Holly can get him goin’.” “Holly is the one.” I’m like, “I don’t give a fuck about no Holly.” “She gon’ get the same shit.” “And she comin’ here on that bullshit.” You know them movies, “It’s only one person could do this.” “We gotta get Holly.” I’m like, “Man, bull-Holly.’ [sniffles] [audience laughs] I’m layin’ in my bed. That’s all I could do every day. I could walk a little bit, but I couldn’t walk. So it’s early in the morning. I hear, “Get up!” Goddamn! “I’m Holly, motherfucker!” [audience laughs] [woman] Oh, damn. I said, “Hey, Holly.” [imitating Holly] “Yes, listen. You gotta knock this shit off.” “This whole Jamie Foxx shit.” “Stop this arrogant bullshit.” “That stroke doesn’t give a fuck about who you are.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker.” [audience cheers] [woman] Go, Holly! “All of this ‘I’m Jamie Foxx’ and this Wesley Snipes shit you’re doin’.” “New Jack City.” “Fuck that city.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, and I can get you there, but you gotta tell me the truth and cut this ‘Jamie Foxx’ shit.” I say, “Yeah, miss lady, I’m good.” “Oh, you good?” “You can beat this?” I say, “Yeah.” “Walk to me now.” I said, “Yeah…” [audience chuckles] [woman 1] Aww. [woman 2] Oh. [man] Damn, bro. She said, “I can help you, Jamie Foxx.” [sniffles] “But you gotta tell me what’s really goin’ on with you.” “You’re dizzy, right?” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” “You’re so dizzy, you can’t walk.” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” She says, “You remember the movie Karate Kid?” I say, “Yes.” She said, “We gonna wax on… [with audience]…wax off.” [audience cheers] I said, “What that mean?” She says, “I’m gonna help you with that so you can go back to bein’ a man.” She said, “Take your right hand, and put it on your left shoulder.” “Your left hand on your right shoulder. Now close your eyes.” And I fell. She picked me back up. “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “I want you to look left, and I want you to look right.” I look left. I look right. I fell. She said, “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “This is it. Look left and look right.” I look left. I look right. I got that. And then she said, “Now, Jamie Foxx, now you got that? I want you to look up and look down.” I look up, look down, I got dizzy. I fell back in my bed, and I said, “Miss Holly, I don’t want to do this no more, man.” “What has happened to me?” [shakily] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “I don’t want to do this.” And she said, “I got 15 more minutes left.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, motherfucka.” [applause] [woman] Holly! “You look left, and you look right.” I looked left, right. She said, “Go to sleep!” [snores] [crowd laughs] The next mornin’… “Get up!” Goddamn, bitch. You gotta get a bell around your neck or somethin’. [audience laughs] She said, “Look left, look right.” Huh? “Look up! Look down!” I said, “Yeah.” “You gotta kill that old Jamie Foxx in order for the new Jamie Foxx to walk outta here.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker!” [audience cheers] Next morning came, Holly came in. I was already out of bed. “Hey, bitch.” [audience laughs] “I knew you was coming, bitch. I’m up!” “Knock it the fuck off.” “Left, right, up, down. Get the fuck outta here.” So I got down again, and Holly took me into the big facility, but there’s other patients in there, and I was down in the dumps. She says, “What’s your fuckin’ problem?” “What is your problem? You don’t want to fight?” She said, “Jamie, when you walk in this facility, look to the left of you, people that ain’t gonna get outta here.” [audience groans] And I did. I looked… There was a quadriplegic. There was a person in a wheelchair. There was another guy’s whole side was gone. She said, “They not gettin’ outta here.” There was one little white lady. All she could do was… turn this little pinwheel. She said, “What do you think now?” And I wept. Cryin’. I said, “God, to all the blessings, go over there.” [man] Yes. [Jamie crying softly] So, then they called my… my psychiatrist, Dragana. He knew I was going through some shit. He says, “What’s goin’ on with you? Why can’t we just talk it out?” I said, “Dragana, we can’t, man, ’cause I’m angry.” “I don’t know why this is happenin’ to me.” And as I said that, I knew why this was happenin’ to me. It was God. [woman] There it is. [gently] It was God. It was God. I talked to him different. I was like, “Hey, man. You sure you got the right dude?” He says, “Who’s this?” I say, “It’s Foxx!” “Who?” “Foxx!” “Come on, G, it’s J!” “Foxx! Jamie Foxx.” “The one down here puttin’ smiles on people’s faces.” “Who?” I said, “Damn. You want my government name? Eric Bishop.” [audience laughs] “Terrell, Texas? The one that beat the odds, that got the Oscars?” “The one that got the Grammys? C’mon, G. It’s J.” “Come on, man!” He said, “What’s up, my n*gga?” [audience laughs] You can tell by that phrase alone that God is not white. [crowd laughs] ‘Cause I wouldn’t even let the Messiah call me that. That’s how me and God talk. I said, “Damn, man, you sure? Why am I going through this?” “Is it a clerical error?” “Did Peter write down the wrong name? I mean, did you read it wrong?” “I’m not sayin’… I’m just sayin’, you been at this for a while.” “Maybe you just… read that shit wrong, my n*gga.” [crowd chuckles] He said, “No. This should be happenin’ to you.” I said, “What? Why?” I said, “God, look at all these bad people.” [crowd murmurs] “Look at all these bad people down here.” “Shouldn’t these bad people be goin’ through this?” You know what he said? “Those bad people already belong to somebody else.” [audience exclaims and murmurs] “You belong to me.” [crowd cheers and applauds] “Remember when you used to say your grace before you ate your food?” “You belong to me.” “Remember when you played the piano for the church?” “When’s the last time you been to church, my n*gga?” [audience exclaims] [man] Mm. [woman] Mm! But I shot back, “God, I get it.” “But the crime don’t fit the punishment.” [crowd laughs] “The crime don’t fit… I’m serious!” “This is too much on me. I’m still down here. I’m gregarious.” “I’m makin’ people laugh, making ’em have fun.” I said, “But look, what this is doin’ to my family, God.” I said, “Look what it’s doing to my kids.” And you know what he said? “You see what they did to my kid?” [audience exclaims] [applause] [woman] Heavy. I gave you two beautiful daughters. [man] Amen. That was my only… begotten son. [scattered applause] And then I said, “Man, why you bringing up old shit?” [audience laughs] As soon as I said it, I got dizzy. I said, “Okay, okay!” “G, come on, man! Come on. Knock it off, bro.” “C’mon, my n*gga. I’m just…” “Bro, I’m a kidder!” [chuckles] “Bro, I’m joking. Come one, man.” “Let me out this bitch. Come on, bro.” “I’m fuckin’ around, bro.” “Okay. I didn’t mean to say ‘fuckin’.” I’m foolin’.” “Just let up off me.” [audience laughing] And finally, it came to me. It’s about blessings. [woman 1] Yes. [woman 2] Right. God blessed me with this talent. [man] Amen. He blessed me with all this money and this fame. And when I forgot about God… [woman 3] Mm! …he blessed me with a stroke. [sound distorts] [gentle piano music playing] [crowd applauding] [Jamie crying] Just give me one second. [gospel singer] ♪ Change me, O God ♪ ♪ Make me more like you… ♪ [Jamie] Y’all know I couldn’t wipe my own ass? [audience laughs] [sweet tune fades slowly] [hushed] I couldn’t wipe my own ass. That’s what really got me at one point. I went from Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx to, “Okay, lean over.” [crowd laughs] “Okay, we’re gonna go in there.” I said, “Damn, y’all gotta go all the way?” Damn, this is… Oh, this is fucked. Ugh. I can’t wipe my own booty… Ass. [inhales sharply] I lost everything. But the only thing I could hold onto was… was my sense of humor. I never let that go. I couldn’t necessarily walk that good. I couldn’t talk that good. But I… But I didn’t let go of my funny. I said, “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” So I was always crackin’ jokes to the point to where the nurses thought I was really losin’ my mind. And I was never myself. Never myself. ‘Cause it’s a wellness check, they ask you who you are. For five days, I was Denzel Washington. I was Denzel. [as Denzel] “All right.” [chuckles] “All right, so that’s what you’re tellin’ me. Okay.” “All right.” [chuckles] “You gotta wipe my ass, huh? Okay.” “All right. Okay.” “That’s what you’re telling me. I had a stroke. Okay.” “All right. You gotta wipe my…” [chuckling] Ah. My nurses. My nurses. [chuckles] “So, you’re tellin’ me… That’s what you’re tellin’ me.” “You gotta wipe my…” “Okay, I’m gonna lean over. Okay. I’m gonna lean over.” [laughs] “I’m gonna lean over. Get on in. Okay. You goin’ too far.” “You get your fuckin’ hands off me!” [crowd applauds] “You think you can do this shit to me?!” [audience laughs] “You’ll be serving tapioca pudding in Pelican Bay when I’m done with you!” [audience chuckles] “You had a stroke, sir.” [with audience] “That stroke ain’t got shit on me!” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. For three days, I was Dave Chappelle. [imitating Chappelle] “Damn, it’s crazy!” “I can’t believe I came in, they said, ‘Dave, you gone and had a stroke.'” “There’s no way Dave could have a stroke. I was incensed!” “Damn, there’s no way. I’m strong! Said they gotta wipe my ass.” “No way! I’m strong!” “Wu-Tang, n*gga! Pow!” [crowd laughs] If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. For six days, I was Mike Tyson. [imitating Tyson] “I’m heavyweight boxing champion of the world.” “Hello, I’m Mike Tyson. Heavyweight boxing champ of the world.” “Somebody told me I had a sthoke.” [crowd laughs] [as nurse] “Sir, it’s ‘stroke.'” [as Tyson] “No, ‘sthoke.’ I had a sthoke.” [as nurse] “You’re not saying it right.” [as Tyson] “I can say it however I want.” “Because I’m Mike Tyson, heavyweight boxing champion of the world.” “So, I say, ‘sthoke.'” “You’re not gonna wipe my ass. Nobody’s goin’ near my culo.” [audience chuckles] “They said I had a sthoke.” “And I gotta fight, and I don’t care who I fight.” “I’ll fight Logan Paul.” [crowd laughing] “I’ll fight Jake Paul.” “I’ll fight RuPaul. I don’t care who it is I fight.” “Because I don’t get sthokes.” “I give sthokes.” “I be sthokin.'” “That’s what I be doin’.” [laughs] If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Then for like five days, I was Jay-Z. [crowd exclaims] [chuckles slightly, imitating Jay-Z] “Last night was crazy.” “It’s crazy. They told me I had an ailment.” “I said, ‘Impossible.'” [audience laughs] “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles slightly] “I started… started off in Marcy Projects, you know.” “Dame had an idea.” “Y’know, he said, ‘Well, you do music.'” “I said, ‘Great.'” “Then later, he came with the clothing line.” [restrained chuckle] “And then I met B.” [awkward, drawn-out laugh] “So, they told me I had an illness. I said, ‘Impossible.'” “They said, ‘Are you mad?’ I said, ‘No.'” “And then they said I need a bedpan.” “And I said, ‘I don’t do bedpans.'” “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles timidly] “And then I shit all over myself.” [audience laughs] [Jamie] “I said, ‘Oh, shit.” “I think I need a bedpan.” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Then for three days, I was this dude. [imitating Trump] “There’s lots of great nurses.” “Lots of great nurses. I see the Blacks.” “I like the Blacks.” “They’re hungry. They’re eating dogs.” [audience laughs] “They’re eating pets! They’re eating dogs!” “They’re eating pets. I like the Blacks.” “The Haitians. Sak pase.” “Map boule. They’re eating dogs.” “I like all of the nurses. I like…” “I like the nurses. I like the nurses.” “I like ’em. They like me. I like them. I like the white nurses.” [emphatic] “I like the white nurses.” “I like the Black nurses.” “I like all of the nurses. The Black…” “I like… I have a huge, huge Black following.” “I got a huge… There’s a Black. There’s another Black.” “There’s another Black. Oh, Puerto Rican. Same shit.” [audience laughs] “I like Kamaya-maya.” “Kamaya-maya Harris.” “I love Kamaya-maya.” “What’s her name? Kamala! Kamala!” “I love Kamala. I love… I love… I love Kamala.” “I love Kamala. I love Kamala.” “She’s Black. She just turned Black. I don’t know where she was.” “She just became Black. She just… ‘Poof, I’m Black!'” “This is fine. If she wants to turn Black, she can turn Black.” “I like her because she’s Black and she’s Indian.” “I like that. I like it.” “She’s mixed. She’s Black. Hey, for real, though. And Indian.” [imitating Native American chant] [audience exclaims] [panting] If I can stay funny… [all]…I can stay alive. [crowd cheering] [Jamie clicks tongue] ‘Cause it was touch and go. [clicks tongue] It was touch and go. [clicks tongue] And they told me, uh… They said the first 15 days, they thought they were gonna lose me because my vitals were out of control. [imitates monitor beeping] They said, “We’re gonna lose him.” So it was a 13-or 14-day period where he says, “We gotta keep him calm.” “And we’ve given him every medication. It’s not workin’.” “We have to keep him calm.” “His vitals are so high, we’re gonna lose him.” You know what the worst thing to have when you tryin’ to stay calm in a hospital room? Black family members. [audience laughs] Aka, n*ggas. ‘Cause you know they come in with, “Oh, Lord!” “Good God Almighty!” “Not my baby! Not now! Not now!” [alert beeps] “Ooh, good God Almighty! Please save him, Jesus!” My Black family was goin’ so crazy, my white doctor said, “Hey, we need to keep these n*ggas outta here so he can stay alive.” I’m jokin’. He didn’t say that. Now, you know if I was to say that, that’s what TMZ would report. [imitates news fanfare] [imitating TMZ announcer] “Jamie Foxx said his white doctor had to call him ‘n*gga’ in order to stay alive.” That’s not what happened. [audience laughs] Yeah. All right? He actually said, “Get these Black motherfuckers outta here.” No, I’m kidding. But it was real. My vitals were so bad, they were gonna lose me. And… that’s when a miracle happened, and that miracle was working through my youngest daughter. She’s 14. I didn’t want her to see me like that. But she snuck into my hospital room with her guitar. [crowd] Aww. And she says, “I know what my daddy needs.” [breathing shakily] She said, “That’s my daddy.” What’s interesting is my daughter used to carry her guitar all the time with her. And they said, when she was playing, my vitals… went down. The nurses at the nurses’ station were baffled. Like, “Wow, what did they give him?” So they rushed into the room, and she said, “Shh.” [softly] I got him. My daughter used to carry that guitar when she was ten years old. She would carry it everywhere. She carried it everywhere. I was like, “You gonna carry a guitar?” Going to Disneyland, she got that guitar. [crowd laughs] We going to a football game, she got that guitar. Everywhere we went, she had the guitar. But you know what I found out? It was God in that guitar. [women] Yes. [crowd applauds] God was in that guitar. That’s my spiritual defibrillator. [crowd] Aww. [crowd cheering] [woman] Aww! That’s Anelise. When you think about, as you grow older, you wonder about those hard times. Who’s gon’ be there? Who’s actually gonna be there? [crowd] Aww. I don’t have to wonder that anymore.

[reciting rhythmically] Now, this ain’t no church song But it’s the closest thing to it No, it’s a conversation with God And how he got me through it See, I remember the moment When my blood turned cold And my heart almost stopped My vision was blurred My veins was blocked They rushed me to the doctor But the doctor couldn’t find a plan So my daughter started to cry But my sister threw up her hands And said, “Please, Jesus” “Not right now” “Please Lord, ’cause I don’t know How to live without him” “I don’t have enough tears to cry” “And I don’t have the wings To fly to you to beg you myself” “So, dear Lord, I bow” “Please, don’t take him now” ♪ Don’t take me now ♪ [crowd cheers] ♪ Give me just a few more minutes ♪ Come on, Anelise.

I want to get through this ’cause every time I run into somebody now, that I haven’t seen in a while, I cry. ‘Cause y’all my people. You’ve known me for so long, so every time I run… Especially when I run into my homies. I ran into T.I., I cried. I think he kinda cried… But he was like… [as T.I.] “What you sayin’, my n*gga?” “What you sayin’ with me, partner?” “I pray for you, partner. Period.” “I pray for your partner. I pray for you. I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, partner.” “I prayed expeditiously for you, n*gga.” [audience laughing] But every time I run into somebody, I cry. I ran into T.I., I cried. I ran into Candice Parker, I cried. Then, somehow, I ran into Halle Berry. [audience exclaims] I didn’t cry as much. [crowd laughs] ‘Cause Halle just rushed me and hugged me so tight. I was like, “Ooh, Lord, have mercy, Jesus.” “This here is Halle Berry.” And she don’t realize how fucking sexy she is. And I don’t want to blow the moment ’cause it was heartfelt. She said, “Jamie, oh my God!” And she hugged me. I said, “Ooh, oh, my gosh.” She said, “There’s so much I wanted to tell you.” And I said, “There’s so much I gotta tell you!” ‘Cause she was huggin’ me. I’m like, “Oh my God.” “Please don’t let me disrespect this moment.” So I had to relay… ‘Cause the hug was so nice, I had to relay to my pickle. “Hey, stand down, n*gga. This ain’t that kind of hug.” He shot back, “Shit!” [audience laughs] “N*gga, that’s Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” “Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” I’m like, “Man, don’t blow this for me, my n*gga. She’ll feel it!” “Please!” And she’s holding me. She’s talkin’ to me, this close to my ear. I said, “Goddamn!” She right here in my ear. I said, “Damn!” Know how women pretty like that always have a fragrance you’ve never smelled. That shit… I said… [sniffs] “Ooh, what the fuck is that?” “God, this smells like Heaven.” I said… [inhales] I took that shit in, and she was hugging me. I said, “Oh, God, please. Please stay with me, Lord. Please.” “Don’t let me fuck this moment up.” She hugged, and then she… As I tried to pull away, she hugged tighter. Oof. I said, “Good God Almighty.” [crowd laughs] And I could feel my hips. I said, “Hips! Hips, stop! Stop!” But I did just clench up to let her know I’m there. [crowd laughs] So she’s huggin’ me, and I’m trying to get out of this moment, and as I’m trying to push away from her heartfelt sexual grip, I tried to push away, know what she did? She kissed me on my neck. [crowd exclaims] And n*gga, I came… [crowd exclaims] …to my senses! [crowd laughing] You nasty motherfuckers. Yo, man, I ain’t finna come like that with Halle. And as she was huggin’ me, “Oh my God, thank you so much.” So Halle, when you see this, please understand what I’m sayin’. You just so beautiful. That’s all we wanna say. Halle you’re beautiful. So she let me go. She let me out of her clutches. I said, “Thank you, Jesus!” But then, I felt a rumblin’. I felt something rumbling. I said, “Ooh, whee!” “I can’t wait.” So I rushed to the bathroom to see what was rumblin’. And I pulled my pants down, and I said, “Oh, shit!” “Somebody back!” [laughs] “Somebody back!” And then I ask him, “Hey, n*gga, what got into you?” Know what he said? “Sometimes, you gotta pop out and show n*ggas.” [intense beat playing] ♪ We back!

I should learn something about the Maldives.” “I don’t know anything about this country.” And Jax had brought this little book of fun facts, so I start reading some fun facts. It said that the Maldives is in the Indian Ocean. Great. It’s comprised of 1,200 islands. Awesome. I read some more fun facts. It said, “It is illegal to be gay… in the Maldives.” [laughter] [laughter] I’m like, “We’re going on our gay honeymoon…” [laughter] “…to a country where it is illegal to be gay.” So I’m like, “Ha-ha, okay, um…” [laughter] “…maybe it’s an old law, it’s not in practice anymore.” And it said, “Oh no.” That’s what it said in the book. “Oh no.” [laughter] “It is illegal to be gay.” “At whatever time you’re reading this, it’s illegal.” [laughter] It can lead to eight years in prison. [audience groans] Yeah! Lashings. I don’t even know what that is, but I don’t want it. [laughter] So I’m on the plane, looking at my brand-new bride with very different eyes. [laughter] All the romance has left my body. ‘Cause here’s the problem. Between the two of us, only one of us can pass for being straight. [laughter] [whooping] And the other one gets called “sir” every time she walks into a bathroom. [laughter] Yeah. Happened to me at Disneyland. I was coming out of the bathroom. I got called “sir.” And I didn’t know what to say, so I turned around and I said, “It’s ma’am!” [laughter] Then I walked out like this. [laughter] I can see how that’s confusing. I was like, “All right, I need to look at this itinerary.” It said that 18 hours into this 24-hour flight, we actually have an overnight layover. And our overnight layover is in Qatar. [laughter and groans] Now, I don’t know if you guys knew this, but it is more illegal… [laughter] …to be gay in Qatar. It can lead to life in prison. Floggings. Again, what is this? [laughter] We’ve now landed. We’re walking into the hotel. I’m panicked. And Jax says, “Listen, when you get nervous, you offer up way too much information.” [laughter] “Now is not the time.” So we have one room booked. We’re filling out the paperwork. And the woman at the front desk asks, “One bed or two?” [audience chuckling] [laughter] And Jax isn’t answering. And I could find myself shifting. I’m turning into a pretty little lady. [laughter] [audience whoops, applauds] I said, “We’d like two beds.” “I’m traveling with my cousin.” [laughter] “We’re going to the Maldives.” “Our husbands are already there.” [laughter] “They were roommates and fraternity brothers in college.” “They just love going on these guy trips and playing golf and smoking cigars.” “We’re just gonna have a little girl time.” “We’re gonna get our nails done and go shopping.” “None of that gay shit’s going on here!” [laughter] Jax is like, “Shut up!” [laughter] We get our keys. We run up to the room. I’m acting like there’s cameras inside of the hotel room. I did, in fact, sleep in that other double bed on the first night of my honeymoon. I slept in a nightgown. Head-to-toe nightgown. [laughter] I don’t even know how that got in my bag. You just land in Qatar and a nightgown appears in your luggage. I kept having these nightmares that someone would break in the room and put me in handcuffs. And as they’re hauling me off, I look back at Jax and I yell, “Tell my story, cousin!” [laughter] Next morning, we run to the plane. Six-hour flight. Land in the Maldives. Then we take an hour puddle jumper to a remote island. And there’s a woman from the resort, on the dock, holding a bucket of Heinekens for all the passengers. It’s a very fancy place. [laughter] Jax goes to reach for these Heinekens, and I go, “Aah! No!” “Lesbian! Beer!” “It’s a trap!” [screams] [audience laughing] I flung it out of her hand and ran like a damsel in distress. Ah! [laughter] I was like, “Oh my God.” “What if this island is just full of a bunch of gay booby traps?” [laughter] “What if they offer us free Crocs?” [laughter] “How am I gonna turn that down?” [laughter] I was afraid there would be a granola trail leading to a bottomless pit. I was like, “I’m not gonna be able to swim all week, ’cause everybody knows I swim in an XXXL T-shirt with the sleeves cut off and a pair of sweatpants.” [laughter] “It’s my lesbian swimsuit.” [audience cheers] I just wanna be under the radar. Normally, on your honeymoon, you’re shouting it from the rooftops. We get to our bungalow, and there’s a cake waiting for us that says “Happy honeymoon.” I was like, “Aah!” I grabbed it and I threw it in the ocean. [laughter] I ate a slice first. I’m not crazy. [laughter] We were there for a whole week. We got one picture together. Jax and I are standing seven feet apart… [laughter] …with a random family in between us, just both giving a thumbs-up. [audience laughing, clapping] It was the least romantic trip of our lives. But a beautiful country. I highly recommend it to all of you non-gay folks. [laughter] I’m learning a lot about marriage. Uh, communication, very important. You have to learn how to fight, because that is an inevitable part of communication. Now, if you are in a newer relationship and you wanna figure out how each other handles stress, you should travel together. Because traveling is stressful. It is why Louise drove Thelma off that cliff. [laughter] “I told you not to eat my snacks.” [laughter] Now, early on in our relationship, Jax and I, uh, we went to Italy, and we landed in Rome, and we had to take a train from Rome to Naples. Those train stations are so chaotic. Our train’s leaving in 30 minutes. We don’t know where our platform is. And at the time, Jax was a kindergarten teacher, so she would talk to me like I was a five-year-old. [laughter] She even said, at one point, “When the hand goes up, the mouth goes shut.” [laughter] [whispers] Wow. And it works. So we had to figure out where to go, and she bends down and she goes, “Hey!” “Are you listening?” [laughter] “Hey!” I’m like, “Yes.” She said, “I want you to stay right here.” “Okay?” “Stay right here and hold our luggage, ’cause you’re a little bit stronger than me.” “I’m gonna go find our platform, ’cause I’m a little bit smarter than you.” [laughter] I was like, “You could’ve ended on the compliment.” She said, “Whatever you do, do not leave.” I’m like, “I got it. God!” [laughter] She said, “Did you wash your hands?” [laughter] “Yes.” “Let me smell ’em.” “No!” [laughter] So she leaves. I’m standing there. It’s so hot. People are passing by me, speaking Italian. They’re like, “Pizza. Pasta. Meatball.” [laughter] Now I’m hungry. She’s been gone forever, so I start showing people our ticket, and someone points me in the right direction. I’m like, “I know Jax told me to stay right here, but I think I could be more helpful if I go to the train, in the air-conditioning, put our bags up.” “I can start eating biscotti, and I’ll text her where to go.” [laughter] So I leave this spot. [audience murmurs] Don’t you turn on me! [laughter] I go to the train, put our bags up, I start popping biscotti, and I text Jax where to go. It’s 15 minutes till our train’s leaving. She does not answer. Ten minutes till the train’s leaving, I call her. She doesn’t answer that. It’s now five minutes till our train’s leaving, and I’m like, “Well, one of us should enjoy this trip.” [laughter] Three minutes till our train’s leaving, I have one foot on, one foot off. I’m looking down the platform like, “Oh my God. Oh my God.” I spot Jax. I wave her down, and she starts running as hard as she can down this platform. I’m like, “Oh my God.” “This is so romantic.” [laughter] “I have never had anyone run down a platform for me.” She gets on the train, doors shut right behind her. And I go… ♪ Reunited, and it feels… ♪ And she goes, “What the fuck?” [laughter] Ugh! That’s not part of my rom-com! [laughter] Julia Roberts doesn’t say “What the fuck?” She says, “I have been looking for you for the last 20 minutes.” I said, “I texted you.” She said, “My phone doesn’t work in Europe.” I said, “I don’t know your phone plan.” [laughter] Then the entire train shushed us, and they pointed at a sign. It turns out, we had accidentally bought a ticket on the quiet car. [laughter] I would’ve never bought a ticket on the quiet car, ’cause I’m like, “How we gon’ chat?” [laughter] But now, Jax wants to fight, and I’m like, “Thank God we got tickets on the quiet car.” [laughter] She’s going in, and I go… [mouthing silently] [laughter] [laughter and applause] [audience cheering] I sit down so proud of myself, thinking I have gotten out of a fight. She found a new way to fight. She goes… [mouthing silently] [audience laughing] This goes on for, like, 45 minutes. [laughter] We were so exhausted from mime-fighting… [laughter] …that we completed two of our exercise rings on our Apple Watches. [laughter] We both eventually passed out. Hour and a half later, we woke up in Naples, biscotti’s rolling down my shirt. Totally forgot what we were fighting about. So my advice to all of you new couples is, go to bed angry. I’m telling you, just sleep it off. It works for bears. Why can’t it work for us? [laughter] [whooping] [cheering] And if you go to Europe and you take a train, just know, one of you is gonna mess up. So I highly recommend you book a ticket on the quiet car. It could save your relationship. It is much cheaper than a therapist, and it comes with biscotti. So that is my advice to you guys. [audience cheering] [Fortune laughs] Now, I never had a serious relationship before Jax. She is definitely my most serious relationship. Now, my parents divorced when I was 12, and I don’t know how this happened, but I somehow became my mom’s husband. [laughter] Which is weird because I have two older brothers, so… [laughter] …I don’t know why I was the man of the house. But I had to make sure everything was okay. I set her alarm clock every night. As I got older, I became my mom’s plus-one in social situations. When I was in college, my mom and I went on trips that were way too romantic for, like, a mother and daughter. We went to New York City and shared frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity, and we walked arm in arm in Central Park. And when you’re single, there’s no one to be like, “Hey, that’s weird. You’re on a date with your mom.” [laughter] When I moved to LA, she and I went on a Christmas Caribbean cruise together. Yeah, shared a room. That’s too much time with your mom. [laughter] I started dreaming of icebergs. [laughter] [Fortune chuckles] I said, “Mom, why don’t you go out there on the ship and try to meet somebody your own age?” She goes, “Why would I wanna meet somebody when I have you?” I’m like, “Oh my God.” [laughter] We are headed for a Grey Gardens situation. [laughter] “Mom, stop talking to that squirrel!” [laughter] I got a break at one point from being her husband. She got a boyfriend. Yeah. They met in the newspaper, in the classified ads. No pictures. You just had to like each other’s grammar. [laughter] But she was a single mom of three kids, and she was a schoolteacher, so she was broke. And after date one, she was sold on this guy. She comes home. She goes, “I like him.” “He is rich.” [laughter] I said, “How do you know?” “‘Cause he told me.” Oh, okay! [laughter] [chuckles] Sure. She goes, “I know from three things.” I said, “That’s very specific.” She goes, “Number one, he drives a Mercedes convertible.” “That is rich.” I said, “Yeah, but what year is it?” ‘Cause when I was in high school, I drove a BMW, but it was 20 years old. And it was a stick shift, and it would just stall in the middle of intersections. And I would have to Fred Flintstone this car out of the intersection to keep from getting hit. When I was going down hills, sometimes the brakes would just give out, so I had to pull up the emergency brake in order to come to a complete stop. And when it rained, dirty rainwater would seep through the sunroof, so I would have to drive with my head tilted to keep from getting pink eye. [laughter] I’m just saying, follow-up questions are important. She said, “Number two, he has his own tanning bed.” I was like… [laughter] [retches softly] Now, for all you young’uns out there, tanning beds were all the rage in the ’90s. People were hopping in those things left and right. It was like the cold plunge of today. [laughter] [Fortune chuckles] Instead of helping with circulation, it could cause cancer. But, oh, you looked great in the winter. “And number three…” She was the most impressed with this. She thought this was the measure of success. She says, “He owns his very own industrial crushed-ice machine.” [laughter] “He is rich.” She would go to his house on the weekends, and take a cooler… [laughter] …and fill it up with crushed ice, come home like she was holding a golden bounty. [laughter] “Crushed ice for a week.” I was like, “Dinner would be nice, but slushies it is.” Couple years later, they broke up. My mom was crushed. [laughter] Sorry. [laughter continues] Sorry. [whooping] She was… crushed, unlike her ice. She had to go back to that broke ice. The ice in the trays, where you’re filling it up with water, and you’re like… trying to put it in the freezer, and everything’s spilling, you’re like, “Ugh!” No, I didn’t meet Jax until I was 35. My mom had gotten very comfortable, uh, with me being her husband. And at 35, she did not think I was in danger of getting took. [laughter] So something happened when I met Jax that I did not expect. My mom got a little jealous. [audience murmurs] Yeah. I remember if I would buy Jax something, like a scarf, my mom would be like, “I like scarves.” I’m like, “You’re not my girlfriend.” [laughter] [Fortune sighs] Their birthdays are five days apart, which is my nightmare. [laughter] I get heart palpitations in February. I remember, early on in my relationship, it was very popular to go on Facebook and profess your love for whoever you were with. So Jax’s birthday, I go on Facebook, and I’m like, “I love you so much.” “You’re the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me.” [imitates vomiting] [imitates vomiting] [laughter] I posted, like, 30 pictures in a collage that took five hours to put together. [laughter] Five days later, I call my mom. “Hey, Mom. Happy birthday.” [laughter] “Thank you.” “Are you okay?” “I’m fine.” “Well, what are you doing?” “I’m on Facebook.” [laughter] “I was looking at my messages, and I don’t see one from you, and I know your thumbs work ’cause you used them five days ago.” [laughter] “I sent you an edible arrangement. What is this?” But she was pissed. So I had to unfriend her. [laughter] [cheering] [Fortune chuckles] I don’t know if any of you guys have ever had to break up with your mom. [laughter] Awkward! Once Jax and I got married, she had another family she had to deal with. She’d get a little jealous if I spent more time with Jax’s family than my family. And I was like, “Well, Jax’s mom makes us apple pancakes…” [laughter] “…and you just asked me to borrow $500.” [laughter] [chuckles] It’s just different. It’s just different. But she does love Jax. She does. She just thinks that Jax stole her man. [laughter] [Fortune tuts] My wife is Jolene. [laughter] [audience cheering] But I fly home to North Carolina to have some one-on-one time with my parents. They like that. I don’t know what it is about going to my hometown, but I immediately revert into a 15-year-old. I could rent a car. I am 25. [laughter] My mom insists on driving me everywhere, so now I have to ask her permission to go places. She has to approve who I hang out with. It’s very weird as an adult. Even my taste buds revert back to when I was in high school. Like, when I’m in the South, I don’t wanna eat at a Michelin star restaurant. I don’t even trust their tires. [laughter] When I’m home, I wanna eat fried food, and I wanna eat biscuits. [cheering] For the European folks watching, these biscuits are like your guys’s, but, uh, they’re fluffier, and they have eight more sticks of butter. [laughter] Now, I love a place back home called Bojangles. [whooping] Pretty tasty biscuits! But the one place that I don’t think gets enough credit is a fast-food chain called Hardee’s. Are you guys familiar with Hardee’s? [cheering] Now, if you don’t know Hardee’s, it’s owned by Carl’s Jr. Very similar vibes, but Hardee’s is known for their biscuits. I’d have to fact-check this, but I think it’s called Hardee’s ’cause it could clog your heart and your arteries. [laughter] But, mmm! Worth it. Now, every woman has a biological clock. Mine is set to know when fast-food chains stop serving breakfast. [laughter] [woman whoops] And Hardee’s ends at 10:30. Last time I was home, I overslept, ’cause my mom didn’t wake me up. [laughter] And I woke up in a panic. I was like, “I need some biscuits!” And I looked at my watch. It said it was 10:15. I go, “Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!” “Mom! Mom!” “I gotta borrow your car. I gotta go get some biscuits.” She said, “My car is in the driveway, and it’s already running.” [laughter] “Why is your car already running?” “Well, I was driving it this morning, and I realized that if I turned it off, it might not turn back on, so I left it running in the driveway for the last hour, just in case we need it.” I was like, “I don’t have time to get into the nuts and bolts of this.” [laughter] “I guess I’m glad you left it running in the driveway and not the garage.” [laughter] “I gotta go get my biscuits.” So I threw on my flannel, got in her car, and I drive across town to the Hardee’s. It’s a small town. I get to the drive-through at 10:22. There’s a line to the street. I’m like, “Oh God. Everybody wants biscuits.” Now, normally, I would park the car, run in, get those biscuits, but I’ll remind you that if I turn this car off, it might not turn back on, and there ain’t no Ubers in this tiny-ass town, and y’all know I’m not walking. [laughter] So I’m waiting in the line like, “Come on! Come on!” 10:28, I get up to the speaker, and I just yell, “Biscuits!” [laughter] You can’t waste time. [laughter] She accepts the order. I’m like, “Yes!” And then that car dies, dead as a doornail, right there in the middle of that drive-through line. I’m like, “No, no, no, no, no, no, no!” She goes, “No? You don’t want biscuits?” I go, “No, no, no, I want biscuits.” “I’m in my mom’s car, and my mom’s car just died.” She goes, “I’ll cancel the biscuits.” “No, no, no, please, don’t cancel the biscuits.” “Will you just ring ’em up, put ’em up front?” “I’ll get rid of this car, I’ll come in, and I’ll get those biscuits.” She goes, “You’ve got two minutes.” [audience gasps] [lightly] Bitch! [laughter] So I don’t know what to do. I can’t walk through the drive-through. I’ve tried twice at midnight. They do not like that. [laughter] I don’t know how I’m gonna get rid of this car. But you know how a mom gets that mom strength when her baby’s in trouble? And she’s gotta, like, lift up a bus to save her baby? [huffs] Well, all of a sudden, I got that mom strength, but for me, my baby was biscuits. [laughter] So I put the car in neutral, I get out of the car, and I turn into an American Gladiator. [laughter] And I start pushing this car, inch by inch. I’m like… [grunting with effort] [laughter] [prolonged grunt] I sound like a feral cat. [high-pitched grunt] These two guys in a truck behind me get out of their truck to come help me. All they see are my broad shoulders from behind, and they go, “Oh, he’s got it.” [laughter] And got right back in their truck. I’m T-Rexing this car… [grunts] [woman whoops] [grunts] I’m sweating my tits off, which is even more confusing for those guys. [laughter] [grunts] I’m in the zone. There’s one minute left. There’s parking spaces across the way. I give the car one last “goosh.” This car starts rolling. I start sprinting towards the door. At least, I think I’m sprinting. [laughter] Thirty seconds. I can smell the biscuits. It’s like the Olympics of the South. All of a sudden, I hear a “boom!” I look up. Everyone in the Hardee’s is staring at me. I had pushed that car so hard, it rolled through the parking space, over an embankment, into a ravine. The hood popped open. Smoke’s billowing out of it. The alarm’s going off. The trunk popped open. I’m like, “Oh my God!” “Biscuits!” [audience cheering] Got the biscuits. Shoved ’em in my mouth. “I did it!” [laughter] I was so proud of myself. I called my mom to tell her what happened. And she told me I was grounded. [laughter] She said, “You are never driving my car again.” I said, “Ain’t nobody driving that car again.” “But I got my biscuits.” [audience cheering] But honestly, I don’t know if my parents should be driving anymore. They’re older now. They’re in their late seventies. And I don’t know, as their kid, when do I have to have that talk with them to tell them they can’t drive? Now, I know with my grandmother, what happened with her is she was driving one day, and she was just chatting away, and then all of a sudden, she went across four lanes of traffic. And we said, “Well, Nana, that’s that.” [laughter] She said, “I didn’t even realize I was driving.” Mm-hmm. [laughter] “Yep.” “We’re gonna need those keys.” [laughter] We’re getting closer with my mom. I can feel it. We had just bought her a new car, and she called me up and just very casually said, “Hey!” “I just drove off a cliff.” [laughter] “What?!” “I was driving, I rounded a curb, and I drove off a cliff.” “I heard you!” [laughter] “I just don’t understand what you’re telling me.” “My car flew through the air.” [laughter] “It landed on a large hill, and then it rolled down to safety.” [laughter] “Okay, but how did this happen, Mom? Were you texting?” “No, I wasn’t texting. I wasn’t talking. Nothing.” “Okay, well, did another car swerve into your lane?” “No, there were no other cars anywhere near me.” “Was it bad weather? Was it raining?” “Mm-mm.” [laughter] “It was a beautiful sunny day.” “One of the best we’ve had in a long time.” [laughter] “Was it a sharp curve?” “Nope. It was a very normal, very approachable curve.” [laughter] I said, “You didn’t do this on purpose, did you?” “No! I had just watched a pickleball tournament.” “I have a lot to live for.” [laughter] She said, “I just drove off a cliff.” [laughter] And then she said one of the greatest things I have ever heard. She said, “It was bound to happen one of these days.” [laughter] [chuckles] What?! [laughter] “Well, Ginger, that’s that.” “We’re gonna need those keys.” [laughter] [Fortune chuckles] [audience cheering, applauding] [whistling, whooping] Now, my mom has always been quirky, for sure, but it is getting worse with age. Like, I truly never know what is gonna be on the other end of any given phone call. She called me last year, and she goes, “Hey.” “I just wanna start by saying I’m okay.” I’m like… [laughter] Jax was like, “I’m going in the other room.” “This is gonna be a while.” [chuckles] She said, “Well, it had just finished raining, and I decided to drive to the cemetery to check on our family plot.” [laughter] I was like, “Normally, that’s the one place you don’t have to worry about.” [laughter] “Well, you would think.” “But it’s a good thing I drove down there, ’cause when I pulled up, I noticed a fresh mound of dirt on our family plot.” “So I got out of the car to get a closer look, and as I’m walking, I realize that some stranger had been buried in our family plot.” I was like, “Oh, I did not see that coming, for sure.” She said, “I walked closer to see whose name was on the marker, and when I got over there, all of a sudden, my foot fell through the grave.” [laughter] “I panicked.” “I panicked because I realized that my foot was about to touch the casket.” [laughter] “I could not bear the thought of that, so I jerked my foot out of that grave, and when that happened, I fell on the ground.” “Well, while I was on the ground, I realized I have fallen, and I can’t get up.” [laughter] [Fortune scoffs] I’m like, “Oh my God. We have reached the Life Alert stage.” [laughter] “It’s worse than I thought.” She said, “I didn’t have my phone on me. I wasn’t expecting to get out of the car.” “I couldn’t get up. I didn’t know what to do.” “So I started to crawl across the cemetery.” [laughter] “Why are you crawling across the cemetery?” “Well, I thought I could crawl across the cemetery, I could go over to the curb, I could sit on the curb, and from there, I could hoist myself up.” “Well, when I got to the curb, I could not hoist myself up, so I just sat there.” “Well, apparently, while this was happening, there was a couple who was driving past the cemetery.” “They looked over, and they saw some thing covered in dirt crawling across the cemetery.” [laughter] “And they thought, ‘Hmm, I wonder what that is.'” “‘Let’s go check.'” I said, “There is no world in which I am driving past a cemetery, I look over and I see some thing covered in dirt crawling across the cemetery, and I’m like, ‘Hmm, I wonder what that is.'” “‘Let’s go check.'” That ain’t happening. [laughter] She said, “Well, they pulled in the cemetery, and when they pulled up to me, it turned out, they were older than me.” [laughter] “They couldn’t help me up, so I asked to borrow their phone.” I said, “Oh, to call a friend?” “No. I called the fire department.” [laughter] “Why?! You are not a cat in a tree!” She said, “Hello. This is Ginger Feimster.” “Fortune Feimster’s mother.” “Do not bring me into this!” [laughter and cheering] “I am in the cemetery, and I have fallen, and I can’t get up.” [laughter and cheering] “Can you please send someone to come get me up?” “But whatever you do, do not drive that large fire truck.” “That would be so embarrassing.” [laughter] And they said, “Ma’am, that is our only mode of transportation.” She said, “So all of a sudden, here came this large fire truck barreling through the cemetery, and then five firemen in full gear got out of the truck.” I’m like, “Oh my God!” These poor firemen. They’re just trying to eat a spaghetti dinner. [laughter] The alarm rings, and they’re like, “Let’s go save some lives!” They put on 300 pounds of gear. They get in their fire truck. They race across town, risking their lives. They pull into the cemetery, and it’s just an old woman on a curb going… [laughter] She said, “One of them got behind me and just went boop and got me right up.” [laughter] “So that was my day.” [laughter] “I had one foot in the grave.” I’m like… [mouthing inaudibly] [audience cheering] That is my mother, Ginger Feimster. So, of course, you can imagine, when I met Jax, she was like, “What of that is in your DNA?” [laughter] [Fortune chuckles] I’m like, “Won’t it be fun to find out?” No, I’m quirky too. I’m definitely very quirky. But I’ve learned to channel it into my performances. Now, I’ve actually been doing this a lot longer than people realize. I was not in, like, theater in school. I was too busy lezzing out on the softball field. [laughter and cheering] But I actually got my start, uh, with performing at church, which is not usually where you think of the arts. [laughter] But my very first musical ever was about Jonah and the whale. And no, I was not the whale, you assholes! [laughter] I was a sailor. It was a very progressive United Methodist Church. [laughter] I had to throw Jonah overboard for disobeying God, and… it was a lot of pressure, you know? My grandma’s in the fourth pew. The Lord’s watching. I didn’t wanna go to church unless I knew it was show day, and then I was like, “And a five, six, seven, eight.” [laughter] I brought a baton to church once… [laughter] …and just started twirling it in front of the congregation. But I was like, “I need to tie this in.” So I just started saying books of the Bible. I was like, “Deuteronomy.” “Genesis.” “Thessalonians.” “Corinthians.” “Job.” [laughter] [audience cheering] [Fortune chuckles] I was a star pupil. I was even in the kids’ choir. I got all of the solos until my nemesis moved into town, Becky fucking Johnson. [laughter] [audience boos] We were 12 years old. All the boys thought she was so cute and pretty and had the best personality, and I thought she was a real bitch. [laughter] She made my life hell. She was cute though. [laughter] But she challenged me to the solo, and the choir director told the boys in our group that they could pick the winner. [audience laments] Thank you! So I decided I was gonna watch the adult choir, and I would just emulate the women from the adult choir, not realizing that I’m 12 and they’re 70-year-old former opera singers. [laughter] So my very first audition, I sang this. ♪ Oh Lord, my God ♪\\n♪ When I in ♪\\n♪ Awesome wonder ♪\\n♪ Consider all thy works ♪\\n♪ Thy hands hath made ♪ [audience cheering, applauding] A freakin’ shoo-in! [laughter] And then Becky fucking Johnson pulled out a boob, got the part. [laughter] That’s where I learned that this business is cutthroat, baby. [laughter] Even at church. The competition continued into the kids’ handbell choir. Ooh, it was very competitive. We practiced every Wednesday night for three hours. No school credit. No snacks. No bathroom breaks. One kid shit his pants… [laughter] …and had to keep ringing like nothing happened. [laughter] [laughter continues] We’re all smelling it, like, “Agh!” [laughter] [retching] [laughter] “Is this worth it?” [laughter] But we hung in there ’cause once every three months, we got to have a big performance in front of the entire congregation. Now, they would line these bells up in order of size. The smallest up here. The biggest down here. Nobody wanted anything to do with these bells. This was the melody. These were the bass bells. It was like playing the tuba. The tuba sounds like you’re playing farts. Blech! Gross! [laughter] But our choir director would only let the little skinny pretty girls, like Becky fucking Johnson, play these bells. Now, I developed before everybody. I was very tall. My voice got deeper. My hair was in a slicked-back, greasy ponytail. I was rocking kitten heels. [laughter, whooping] And one Sunday, I decided to shoot my shot. I said, “Hey!” [in gruff voice] “I’d like to get in on these bells down here.” [laughter] “I’ve been playing goalie, and I’m ready to get in on the field, Coach.” “I got big hands.” “I can actually hold two of these bells with each hand. Watch.” Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. [laughter] [in own voice] He was like, “Don’t do that.” [laughter] “So, uh, am I in or out?” He said, “Your bells are down there.” I’m like… [grunts] So I did the walk of shame to this end of the table. My grandma’s looking at me like, “What the fuck?” [laughter] You can cuss when you’re a Methodist. So we start playing our big song. They’re playing everything. I’m just standing here, waiting. I’m in my sister-wife dress. [laughter] Looking like a human napkin. [laughter] And who’s down there playing the entire song, getting all the glory of God? [audience joins in] Becky fucking Johnson! Ugh! [laughter] I am so bored just waiting to play one note. I start smoking a cigarette. [laughter] Drinking coffee. Finally, we get to the end of the song, and I get to pick up my big-ass bell. [grunts] I’m like, “Here we go.” I get to play the very last note. I go, dong… [fades out] [laughter] [fades back in]…ong. I’m like, “That’s it?” My grandma’s like, “That’s it?” I thought, “Oh my God.” “I have spent all this time, week after week, hours and hours, no school credit, no snacks, shit in my face.” [laughter] “I did that for the Lord, and all I got in return was one note.” And that’s why I’m gay. [laughter] [audience cheering] I tried. [laughter] A few years ago, I looked to see what Becky F Johnson was up to. [laughter] That’s what I call her now that I’ve matured. Back then, she was unhappily married to a man, so there is a god. [laughter] And I may not go to church on Sundays anymore, but I do have my own Sunday morning ritual. [chuckles] I gotta commit to this. [chuckles] [audience laughs] I make my… [snickers] [laughter] I got this. [audience cheering] [clears throat] I make myself a cup of coffee. I pull out my laptop. I go on Facebook. I re-friend my mom. [laughter] And I look to see if Becky F Johnson’s life is still a living hell. [laughter] And all I can say is… ♪ Hallelujah ♪\\n♪ Hallelujah ♪\\n♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪\\n♪ Hallelu… ♪\\n♪…jah! ♪ [audience cheering] Ugh, that is so petty. Oh my God. [laughter] I cannot be petty. No. I have a lot to be grateful for, truly. I cannot be petty. I am so grateful that my life has unfolded the way it has. I could’ve never guessed this. I’m so grateful that I met Jax. Um… She’s the best. [man] Whoo! [audience cheering] Jax and I took our next big step together. Um… No, not kids. [snickers] [laughter] We actually bought a house together, uh, which was very exciting. A very adult thing to do. [cheering and applause] And Jax is the exact person you wanna do this kind of adult decision with. She’s very responsible. She asks all the right questions. She was like, you know, “How’s the roof?” Uh… “What’s the plumbing like?” “Is there mold?” I’m like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.” Um… “And, uh, I don’t know, are there ghosts?” [laughter] She looked at me like I was crazy. I’m like, “That’s a valid question.” Because when I was home, I… Ghosts were on my mind. There’s these houses in my hometown built in the 1800s, and a lot of ghost sightings have happened there. I don’t know what it is about ghosts in the 1800s. Uh, the 1800s is a very popular time for ghosts. [laughter] I’m just saying, you don’t see a lot of ghosts in Daisy Dukes. [laughter] So people have been spotting these ghosts so much that they’ve become very casual about it, in a way that I’m not used to. So I was having lunch with my mom and her friends, and my mom said, “You know, I went to the Tates’ house a couple of weeks ago.” “I went upstairs to use the bathroom, and when I came out of the bathroom, there was Catherine.” I said, “Who’s Catherine?” She goes, “Well, she’s dead.” [laughter] “And she’s a ghost.” And all of her friends go, “Mm-hmm.” She said, “Catherine grew up in that house.” “She lived there her whole life. Never got married. Never had kids.” “She died in that house, and then when the Tates moved in, there was Catherine.” “She was in the den, the living room, the kitchen, outside of the bathroom.” “It’s just Catherine.” I said, “So Catherine just comes with the house?” Her friend goes, “Yep. I saw her a couple of weeks ago. She looked great.” [laughter] [woman whoops] So hearing about Catherine made me think about the house that I grew up in. It made me think about the house Jax and I were looking at. And it was just on my mind. Now, I’ve never seen a ghost. I’m more of an energy person. It sounds very LA to be like, “I’m an empath.” [laughter] But when I was growing up, in this house that I grew up in… It was built in the 1800s. It had such a weird energy to it. I could never pinpoint what that was. Um… I just felt so unsafe in that house. I would make my dad sit outside of my bedroom until I fell asleep. And I would catch him trying to crawl out of the bedroom, like my mom in the cemetery. [laughter] And I was like, “Dad, I’m scared!” So he didn’t sleep for a year and a half. And then he and my mom divorced. I think ’cause he just wanted to take a nap and get the hell outta that house. So as my punishment, I became my mom’s husband. Now, when I was in high school, she got that rich boyfriend I was telling you about, and she would go there on the weekends, and I would be there by myself, so scared, I slept with a knife under my bed. Not my cake-cutting knife. A different one. [laughter] And hearing about Catherine, this all comes up, and I said, “Mom, you know, the house that we grew up in, that house had such a weird energy.” My mom said, “That house was the most haunted house…” [laughter] “…I have ever lived in.” “You mean the house you left me in alone when I was a teenager?” “I had to. I was scared.” [laughter] I said, “What did you hear?” “Well, when I was there, I would hear footsteps at night, going up and down the stairs.” “You and your brothers were asleep. I would hear door slams, screams.” “That thing was evil.” “You should’ve told me. I would’ve gone to my grandmother’s house.” “Your grandmother’s house was the second most haunted house I have ever been in.” “Your grandfather has been floating around there since 1963.” [laughter] “But whatever was in our house was so evil that I said to it one night, ‘If you do not leave, I’m gonna call the Duke University paranormal department.'” [laughter] I don’t know if that’s an Ivy League Ghostbusters or what that is. She said, “But I did not wanna fool with it.” “I decided to put our house on the market.” And then she started whispering. “But I did not disclose that there was a ghost, and that house has been sold every five years ever since.” “So I believe evil still lurks within.” [laughter] Now, a couple of months ago, I was in Chicago for a show, and the night before, I was leaving a restaurant, and this man stops me, and he goes, “I have something weird to ask you.” I said, “Oh man.” [chuckles] “I am about to touch a wiener.” [laughter] [Fortune chuckles] [laughter continues] He said, “I think my good friend lived in your childhood home.” And he asked me the address. I said, “That is my childhood home.” I said, “Can I ask you a weird question?” I said, “Did your friend ever say if that house was haunted?” He said, “My friend said that was the most haunted house he’s ever lived in in his entire life, and he and his family moved out after six years.” So evil does lurk within. That’s why I’m saying, if you’re buying a house, do not be afraid to ask about ghosts. And if the disclosures say, “The roof is from 1996, there’s new plumbing, oh, and Catherine will join you at the table,” don’t buy that house. But I’m happy to say that Jax and I have been in this house now for over a year, and so far, no ghosts. Uh, so I’m very excited about that. Thank you. You guys really get me. [applause and cheering] But there is one thing that I wanted to do in this house. Now, in this journey to where I’m at now, it’s been about 21 years in Los Angeles. And it took me a really long time to… to get traction, to… to work, to be successful. And during that time of working hard and not getting anywhere, I would daydream about one day, if I’m lucky enough to work, to make money, to buy a home, there is something I am going to put in that house, and that will be the symbol of success. And I didn’t know where this idea came from. [laughter] But I will tell you guys that six months ago, I installed my very own… …industrial crushed-ice machine. [audience laughing, cheering] [cheering intensifies] I made it, baby! The only problem is that now my mom wants to move in with us… [laughter] …which would, in fact, make our house haunted. [laughter] I said, “Why don’t you just come over for slushies instead?” She goes, “Well, I think, at the very least, that we should, in February, for mine and Jax’s birthday…” [laughter] “…the three of us should go on a cruise.” “You pay.” [laughter] I said, “Mom, I love you, but I would rather go back to the Maldives wearing Crocs, rainbow shorts, and a cut-off tee that just says ‘dyke.'” [laughter and whooping] “That ain’t happening.” Thank you guys so much! [audience cheering] Thank you for being here. [rock music playing] Seattle, you’re the best. [cheering continues] [rock music continues] Someone wanted to know how you feel about my current material involving you. Um… I’ve been your material for a long time. [Fortune] Mm-hmm. [laughter] And I haven’t gotten any revenue. [laughter and whooping] [cheering and clapping] [barks]\"],\n",
              " 'jeff': ['Jeff Dunham’s “Scrooged-Up Holiday Special” brings his signature comedic edge to the holiday season in Milwaukee’s iconic Pabst Theater. The show blends stand-up comedy and ventriloquism with a festive twist as Dunham and his cast of quirky characters reimagine “A Christmas Carol.” Highlights include Walter’s cranky takes on Christmas traditions, Bubba J’s beer-fueled holiday musings, Peanut’s chaotic antics, and Achmed’s dark humor as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Dunham intertwines hilarious banter, nostalgic reflections, and playful audience interactions, all while casting his characters in a potential film adaptation of the Dickens classic. With laugh-out-loud moments and a lively holiday atmosphere, Dunham delivers a unique blend of irreverence and cheer for fans of all ages. * * * [upbeat rock music] [Bubba J] Hey, everybody! It’s the holidays! A time for some joy and laughter. And no one hands out that stuff better than your friend and mine, Jeff Dunham! [audience cheering] Hey, hey, Milwaukee! [audience cheering] Welcome to my Scrooged-Up Holiday Special in the beer capital of the world. [audience cheering] Man, what a gorgeous theater. What a perfect place to do this. My boys have been exploring it, you know, during the day when nothing’s going on here. That third balcony is way the heck up there. That’s literally the nosebleed section. It’s awesome. They were running around, and James discovered something today that I thought was pretty great. So, he’s running around. And because it’s the Pabst Theater, he found the ‘P’ on the carpet upstairs. Right there. See it? And it runs all the way, up and out… the sides of all the runners going up and down the hallways You can see him point to it. Oh, yeah, there he is pointing to it. He thought that was very cool. No. He didn’t think it was cool. He thought it was hilarious because if you back up a little to the next photo, it spells “poop.” [audience laughing] So, why a Christmas special? Well, I’m sharing with you what I know and what I grew up with. I was raised in a home that celebrated Christmas, so this is a Christmas special. If I was Jewish, this would be a Hanukkah special. If I was black, this might be a Kwanzaa special. If I was an atheist, this would be a special. [audience laughing] But Christmas is extra special for me, because when I was eight years-old, that year under the Christmas tree, Santa left me my very first ventriloquist dummy. And I’ve shown this photograph before, but I have to show it again because it’s one of my favorite ones. So, under the tree is Mom and me and my first dummy and Dad, and there we are right there. [audience applauding] [Jeff] Thank you. I think I love that picture also because you can tell how proud my father is. [audience laughing] But that moment right there began a lifelong career leading to this very moment here tonight. But this special is different from any one I’ve ever done. My wife Audrey came up with the idea of me and my guys doing our own film version of the Dickens classic, A Christmas Carol. I thought that would be a great movie. Why not? Let’s see if we can get it made. But then in the meantime, I thought, how about for my next stand-up special, what if it’s me talking to the guys about their possible roles in the film and what characters I think they should play. So, tonight I’m casting. [audience laughing, cheering] So, if you know the Christmas Carol story, see if you can guess who of my guys should play whom in the movie. [laughing] You guys ready for the little people in the boxes? [audience cheering] The first guy I’d like to introduce has been in my act a long time, and I’m fairly certain you can guess who he’d play in A Christmas Carol. Please help me welcome my old friend, Walter. [audience cheering] Shut the hell up! Good evening, Walter. And why am I dressed like this? I am hot as hell! I know. I think I’m having a stroke. Come on. [gargling sound] I bet you love the holidays. I bet you’re an idiot. Come on. What’s your favorite Christmas carol? My favorite Christmas carol… That’s right. You mean one that makes me feel joy and hope and a beautiful peace inside? That’s right. “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.” [audience laughing] That’s not a Christmas carol. Just imagining fills me with great joy. Well, I’m happy to see you dressed for the occasion. Me? I didn’t do this. You did this to me! He takes us on the tour bus and plays dolly freakin’ dress-up. No, I don’t. No one can hear us scream. That’s not true. Ah! He’s touching us again! Stop it. You look great for the occasion. What occasion? This is our Christmas special, and this special is gonna be on Amazon Prime. Amazon? Yeah. Oh, so they’re gonna deliver this special and leave it on everyone’s front porch? [audience laughing] Inside another box that’s ten times the size it needs to be? [audience laughing] Then some jerk comes along and steals it off the porch, and I have to order it all over again? You know, Amazon makes things very convenient. Yeah, and how lazy have we gotten? I mean seriously. “I need a, uh, a toothpick. I think they’re upstairs. Nah, that’s too far to walk.” [audience laughing] “I’ll just order it on Amazon.” Let’s see. Two cents for a toothpick and 29 dollars for shipping. Done. [audience laughing] Walter… Then, five minutes later it’s at my front door. Yeah. “Oh, look! They shipped me my toothpick in a box the size of a [bleep] Yugo.” [audience laughing] A Yugo? That’s your reference? I guess you’d prefer a Prius? [audience laughing, cheering] That was a long time ago. You are forever damaged, my friend. Look, our special’s gonna be on Amazon Prime, the subscription service. Oh, good, so we can subscribe, watch this special, then quickly unsubscribe so they won’t charge us. That’s not the best way to save money. Says the guy who owned a Prius. [audience laughing] A blue Prius. [audience laughing] Does your wife enjoy the holidays? My wife? You mean the nutcracker? [audience laughing] Your wife is a lovely lady, and I know that you love her very much. Whatever. Tell everyone what you gave your wife last Christmas. COVID. No. [audience laughing] Look, next year there’s an idea of us filming a Christmas movie. A movie? Yeah, I’m picking the best roles for all the guys. Oh, and that’s why I’m dressed like this? Yes. So I have to act? Ever done any acting? Sure. Like what? I laugh at your jokes. [audience laughing] That’s not funny. No, not usually. They’re not. [audience laughing] What’s the movie? A Christmas Carol. And all of us are gonna be in it? That’s the plan. And, uh, have you actually decided on who gets what role? I’m working on that right now. Okay, so you’re trying figure out who I should play? [audience laughing] Well, yeah. So, for me, you’ve narrowed it down to a few possible characters? [audience laughing] I’m a very versatile actor. I’m sure. I can even be that little kid who has a crutch. [audience laughing] Tiny Tim. Why are we suddenly talking about your… Oh! Oh! Oh! The kid! Tiny Tim! [audience laughing] I thought you were talking about your… Walter… Tiny Tim. Walter! I’m sorry. Tiny Tim has a very important role. I’m sure he does, Jeff. Good for you! [audience laughing] This is a Christmas story. Good place to hang the mistletoe. That’s all I’m saying. [audience laughing] Walter… You know, the twigs and berries. Will you stop it? [audience laughing] Okay, back to the movie. Now, what’s that kid’s name? It’s Tiny Tim. Right. And I’m telling you… with a little makeup, I could be that kid. You could be Tiny Tim? He’s angry, right? No. Oh, I think he is. What is it he always says? Well, his most famous line is, “God…” Oh, yeah! “God, why was I born? It’s a hard-knock life!” [audience laughing] What? Then, he sings it, and the sun comes out tomorrow, and blahdy-blah-blah. I hate that stupid show. That’s Annie. Yeah. And then Tiny Tim gets left alone at his house, and his mother yells, “Kevin!” [audience laughing] That’s Home Alone. I could be Kevin, and you could be the guy that gets hit in the head with a box of tools and his hair catches on fire. [audience laughing] Can you act? Can I act? You know, hang on a second. What? I don’t mean to interrupt here. I keep looking at you. I don’t usually throw around compliments. I just gotta say here, you know, you’re getting old, but you’re still looking pretty good. Don’t you think so? He’s doing all right? [audience cheering] Thank you. Ha-ha. I’m [bleep] with ya. I’m acting. [audience laughing] One of the most moving scenes in the story is near the end when Scrooge breaks down crying because he’s filled with regret. Do you think you could do that? Oh, sure. I’ll just pretend I’m your father. [audience laughing] [laughing] What does that mean? Oh, come on. Think about you. What? Your father saved his entire life to send his only son to a university. Yeah? Then, you took your degree, did nothing with it, and ended up doing a puppet show. How much does that suck for your parents? Walter… I mean, look at what you’re doing now. This seems pretty good to me. No, not that. This. What? You’re arguing. Yeah? With me! [audience laughing] Right. Which is actually you! You know what’s really weird? What? You’re also losing this argument! [audience laughing] You ever seen The Twilight Zone? You’re freaking in it! [audience laughing] [sings The Twilight Zone theme] [audience laughing] Let’s talk about your actual role in A Christmas Carol. I don’t know who I would be. [chuckling] It’s very obvious. It is? Yeah, you don’t even have to audition. What? Think about it. Who do you look like? Uhh… Come on. Good God, you? No, not me! Well, folks say you and I kind of look alike. Well… Come on. Do the face. [audience laughing, cheering] That’s just scary. Please tell me we’re not related. [chuckling] All right. At least I can smile. [audience ooh’s, laughs] I can smile. Really? Yeah, well, it hurts a little when I do. [audience laughing] Let’s see. [audience laughing] Oh, I think I pulled a groin muscle. [audience laughing] As for our movie, Walter, you would be Scrooge. What? Me? Come on. Ebenezer Scrooge was a very rich man who never got married. Oh, hell yeah. I’ll be that guy. [audience laughing] In the beginning of the story, Scrooge is very lonely. Do you know why? He was a ventriloquist? [audience laughing] Sorry. In the story, Scrooge gets woken up three times in the middle of the night. And it gets worse and worse the older you get. [audience laughing] Back then, women were expected to marry, have children, and keep a nice household. And those were the only acceptable roles for women during that era. Is that too much to ask? [audience laughing] Are you trying to turn off every woman in this room? Oh, no, no. You’ve got that covered. [audience laughing] Hey ladies, you wanna hear a sentence that in the history of humans no woman has ever said? Ready? [women in audience cheering] “Ventriloquist… that’s hot.” [audience laughing] Wah-wah. [audience laughing] Who wrote A Christmas Carol? Charles Dickens. [giggling] Sorry. Just laughing at his last name. Dickens. They could be friends. Who? Tiny Tim and Little Dickens. [audience laughing] You sure Tiny Tim’s name isn’t Kevin? No, it’s not Kevin. That’s Home Alone. Well, that’s you as a kid… home alone, playing with your Tiny Tim. [audience laughing] Say goodnight, Walter. Thanks, Milwaukee! [audience cheering] Our next guy up is pretty much a party animal and perfect to play in our movie as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Please welcome your good buddy and mine, Bubba J. [audience cheering] [upbeat rock music playing] [goofy laughter] How you doing, Bubba J? Pretty good. And ho-ho-ho! Oh, it’s not Christmas yet. Oh, well then, ho-ho-hold my beer. [goofy laughter] [audience laughing, cheering] It’s Milwaukee. They love that crap. Okay. [audience laughing] [audience cheering] [goofy laughter] Bubba J. What? Have you done any acting? Oh, sure. Really? Yeah. When? When the police pull me over, I act like I haven’t been drinking. [audience laughing] What if there’s a breathalyzer? [chuckles] I get to go on a sleepover. Oh. [audience laughing] Can we talk about the movie now? Okay. To talk about the movie, let’s get in the mood of the season. Okay. When I wake up on Christmas morning, I’m happy to be alive. Well, you didn’t drink as much as I did. [audience laughing] So, Christmas is my favorite time of year. It’s all about loving your fellow man. [audience laughing] Really? Yes. Uh, does your wife know that? [audience laughing] That’s a shocker. You should be upfront with Audrey about that. I had no idea. She’s gonna be like, “Jeff, why do you now like the hot dogs more than the honey-baked ham?” [audience laughing] They honey-baked ham? They know what I’m talking about. All right. [audience laughing] It’s warm… That’s enough. Okay. [audience laughing] Hey, in this movie, do we get presents? I don’t know. Come on. Presents are the best part about Christmas. Well, you know, Bubba J, it is better to give than to receive. Yes, especially when you’re in prison. [audience laughing] No honey-baked ham. All right. [audience laughing] [goofy laughter] It’s more like a rump roast. Will you stop? I’m so sorry. [audience laughing] [Jeff] This is not my fault. So, does your wife bake during the holidays? Oh, yeah. What? Meth. No. No. [audience laughing] What? I mean like a holiday treat. Well, she can put colored sprinkles on it for ya. Oh, whoops, I said “colored.” Nice knowing you, cracker. [audience laughing] So, do you have a favorite Christmas carol? Oh, well, my dad likes the song “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.” Oh, you know, a couple years ago, that song was kind of canceled. Do you know why? Uh-huh. Global warming. [audience laughing] How about “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus?” Oh, I did too, but I think it was my uncle. [audience laughing] All right, back to our movie. Okay. Did you see the movie The Muppets’ Christmas Carol? Oh, no, I hate puppets. They scare me. [audience laughing] Okay. So, the movie we’re shooting is our version of A Christmas Carol. Okay. It’s a story about a man who learns the true meaning of Christmas. Was it during a Zoom meeting? [audience laughing] No. You know, one time during a Zoom meeting, I learned the true meaning of forgetting to turn your camera off during personal time. [audience laughing] On Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by three ghosts. Do you know why? He swiped right? No. No. [audience laughing] The Ghost of Christmas Past wakes up Scrooge in the middle of the night and says to Scrooge… “We’ve been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty.” [audience laughing, cheering] No. In this movie, I want to be a superhero Santa. And instead of reindeer, I have hot chicks with Christmas ta-tas. [audience laughing] I’m afraid to ask… what are “Christmas ta-tas,” Bubba J? They’re like ornaments that I can touch. [audience laughing] No. No. You sound like all the girls I dated. “No. No.” [audience laughing] ♪ Can’t touch this… ♪ [humming] [audience laughing] So, when you were a kid, did Santa come down the chimney at your house? We didn’t have a chimney. We lived in a mobile home. Oh. My parents said he came up the tailpipe. [audience laughing] I think there’s another prison joke here if you want it. [audience laughing] [audience cheering] You know, my daddy kinda looked like Santa. Really? What, did he say ‘ho-ho-ho?’ Sometimes when my sisters were going out. [audience laughing] Was your father that mean? No, he was just counting. [audience laughing] I see. One time, he said ‘ho’ four times. What did that mean? [goofy laughter] Mom was going with ’em. [audience laughter] Okay, so in England, do you know who they call ‘Father Christmas?’ Nick Cannon. No. [audience laughing] Are you familiar with Dickens? Oh, yeah. Yesterday I stepped on a rake, and it hit me in the Dickens. No. [audience laughing] No. Charles Dickens. Oh, yours has a first and a last name. [audience laughing] Fancy. Bubba J… Hey, honey, meet Charles. [audience laughing] You know, people have been reading A Christmas Carol for 150 years. Then I’d say it’s too long. [audience laughing] They can’t all be gems. Shut up. [audience laughing] But like I said, we’re shooting our version of the story. We are? Yeah, we’re shooting Scrooge. Well, I hope he’s white. Otherwise, it’ll be a hate crime. [audience laughing] Sometimes, I ad-lib you into trouble, don’t I? [audience laughing] In the story, Scrooge becomes a second father to Tiny Tim. Oh, my uncle is my second father. Oh. Yeah, and my real father, too. [audience laughing] Then he had that operation, and he was my other mother. [audience laughing] [goofy laughter] Okay, like I said, Scrooge has three visitors in the middle of the night. Like Jack Daniels? No. No. Jim Beam? Dos Equis? No. No! Ghosts. Ghosts? Yes, and I want you to play the Ghost of Christmas Past. You want me to be a ghost? Yeah. I shouldn’t do it. Why not? It never goes well when there’s a redneck in a white sheet. [audience laughing, cheering] Well… [laughing] Boo! I got it. Since the story takes place in old England, can you speak with a British accent? Oh, yeah, sure. I do it when the cops pull me over for driving on the wrong side of the road. [audience laughing] [drunk British accent] “Hello, there, Officer.” [audience laughing] “I had no idea you blokes drive on the wrong side of the road.” “Rah, rah, rah, rah.” [audience laughing] Does that work? Oh, yeah. Because your accent is so good? No, because my teeth are so bad. [audience laughing] Well, A Christmas Carol takes place in London around the time Queen Victoria married her first cousin. Oh, she beat me to it. [audience laughing] But she was Queen until she was eighty-two-years-old. Do you know what happened after that? Uh, they convinced her to not run for a second term? [audience laughing, cheering] [goofy laughter] I’m smart. I watch TV. All right. So, Bubba J, what happens when the director of a movie yells, “Action?” Oh, that’s my favorite kind of movie. [hums stereotypical porn music] [audience laughing] You know, if you’re an actor, you have to know your cue. Oh, that’s nothing. When a cop pulls me over, I have to know the whole alphabet. [audience laughing] Okay, so in the movie, you’re playing the Ghost of Christmas Past. How was I? What? If I’m the Ghost of Christmas Past, I already did it. No, you haven’t done it yet. You’re playing him in the future. Oh, we’re going back to the future? No. Can I take Scrooge to the past in a DeLorean? [audience laughing] Are you joking? Jokes? Where we’re going, we don’t need jokes. [audience laughing] [audience cheering] So, Bubba J, we’ve now gotten to the part that I think is your favorite part of the show. Can I introduce it? Sure. This is the part of the show where you get to hear about what I think about after I’ve had a few too many. [goofy laughter] This is ‘Bubba J’s Egg Nog Shots and Christmas Thoughts.’ [audience cheering] Every Christmas, my mother bakes us cookies and a gingerbread halfway house. [audience laughing] Think about this… is Cindy-Lou Who Chinese? [audience laughing] [audience laughing] Is it wrong for a snowman to ask Santa Claus for a bigger carrot? [audience laughing] If the Grinch stole Kwanzaa, would Democrats say it was Trump’s fault? [audience laughing] When the little drummer boy played for baby Jesus, was that the peak of his career? [audience laughing] Did the three wise men include gift receipts? [audience laughing] You know what those gifts were, right? Oh, yeah. Gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Good for you. Very beautiful gifts. Yeah. I doubt when he was in the manger and was given those gifts, that’s the first time anybody went, “Jesus Christ, look what you got!” [audience laughing, cheering] Keep going. Maybe Santa wouldn’t have to check his list twice if he used a bigger font. Duh. [audience laughing] Is Santa bipolar? [goofy laughter] You get it? I wrote that one. I’m killin’ right now. That’s good. When Santa goes to a strip club, does he make it snow? [audience laughing] Why you laughing? I wrote that yesterday. It’s funny. [audience laughing] If there’s an earthquake on Christmas in Los Angeles, I bet you’ll find a shelf on an elf. [audience laughing] For Christmas this past year, I got my wife a boob job. For Christmas this year, I’ll get her the other one. [audience laughing] And finally, can a Gingerbread Man transition? [audience laughing] What would he become? [goofy laugh] A donut hole. [audience laughing, cheering] Say goodnight, Bubba J. Thanks, Milwaukee! Merry Christmas! Happy New Year! [audience cheering] [indistinct Bubba J chatter, goofy laughter] For the next cast member in our movie, I realized I had the perfect guy to play Tiny Tim. He’s a semi-professional ventriloquist dummy that I designed and just happen to sell online and on Amazon, but… this is the brand-new and improved and cuter version 2.0 for kids and adults. Please help me welcome the perfect Christmas present for any new ventriloquist, Little Jeff. [upbeat rock music playing] [audience cheering] How you doing, Little Jeff? Oh, I’m doing just fine, Jeff. Thank you very much. Okay. And you know where we are? Oh, yeah, sure. We’re in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. That’s right. Yeah. [audience cheering] In the lovely and historic Pabst Theater. That’s right. Yeah. Where you have dressed me like a bum. Hey. Okay, we’re really not supposed to use the word ‘bum’ anymore. Oh, my apologies. It’s offensive to some folks. That’s right. Why am I dressed like this?! Looks like Goodwill went to ill will. [audience laughing] Or I need a freaking will. All right. Am I supposed to be homeless? It’s not homeless. But wait a minute! The other guys and I already live in boxes, so we are kind of homeless already. Just look. We’re going to be shooting a movie, and I want you to play Tiny Tim. Who you calling tiny? No, it’s just a character name. Well, I don’t like it. I’m taller than Tom Cruise, I’ll have you know. [audience laughing] Shut up! I am! He does his own stunts ’cause little guys don’t get hurt. [audience laughing] I didn’t know that. Oh, sure. You can carry him around in one of those frickin’ suitcases, too. See, he could be in A Christmas Carol. Tiny Tom. [audience laughing] I don’t think so. Tiny Tom and Tiny Tim could fight Evil Scrooge. [laughing] [laughing] I got a weapon right here. Hi-ya! Hi-ya! [hums Mission Impossible theme] [audience laughing] Can you put that down, please? Okay, whatever. Not like it’s my crutch. [audience laughing] This jerk hot-glued it in my hand. I hate you. All right. [audience laughing] I don’t look like this when you’re buying a box. I don’t have on my stupid hat and the bum clothes. You’re not… don’t say “bum.” Bum bum. Bum bum bum. Bum bum bum bum. Bum-bum, bum-bum-bum, bum-bum. Hi-ya! [humming] Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee, dun-dun-dun. Can we go on? I don’t care. I forgot where we were. Mil-wau-kee. I know that. [audience laughing] Be nice, or Santa Clause won’t bring you anything. That fat guy never gave me nothin’! Really? Maybe ’cause you’re not nice. I’m nice! You sure? Ahh… Santa knows when you’re naughty and nice. Why does no one find it creepy that Santa does constant surveillance on your kids? [audience laughing] So, I’m curious… do you have any Christmas traditions? Yeah, I like to go to Vegas. Ah. Does it feel like Christmas in Vegas? It does when the strippers wear Santa hats. [audience laughing] You know we’re making a Christmas movie? Is it one of the horrible sappy ones on the Hallmark Channel that make me wanna dropkick a cat? [audience laughing] No. Like I said, it’s our version of A Christmas Carol. Oh, that sounds fantastic! Any big stars in this movie? Uh, well, I’ll be in it. So that would be ‘no.’ Anybody else? [audience laughing] All of us, including you. If you say you want me to be a tiny little elf, I will Tom Cruise you. Hi-ya! Look, in this story, Tiny Tim is dying. Aw, how come? Well… You wrote his jokes? [laughing] That’s funny crap right there. That’s a good one. I got you there. Does this Tiny Tim have a job? No. So, he’s unemployed and he’s a foreigner. Bus him to California. They’ll love his ass. [audience laughing, cheering] And Tiny Tim needs medical help? Yeah, some kind of operation. Oh, so then Tiny Tim becomes Tiny Tina? [audience laughing] Why don’t we talk about Christmas carols? Maybe you could sing one at the end of the movie. What? I don’t know any Christmas carols. I bet you know more than you think. I don’t know. I’ll give you a line or two of the song, and I think the rest will just pop into your head. Okay, whatever. ♪ O Holy Night ♪ ♪ I think you’re out of tune ♪ [audience laughing] ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ No one knows what the heck a bough is ♪ [audience laughing] ♪ Hark, the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Who is Harold and is he a queen? ♪ [audience laughing] ♪ O come all ye faithful ♪ ♪ I can’t believe you said that ♪ [audience laughing] [audience cheering] ♪ Silent Night ♪ ♪ Your hearing ain’t right ♪ [audience laughing] ♪ What child is this? ♪ ♪ With Maury Povich ♪ [audience laughing] ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ ♪ If you’re wearing them, you’re gay ♪ No!

[Jeff] Thank you. The Ghost of Christmas Present was another bit of easy casting for me, because there’s no one more present or in your face than this purple guy. Please help me welcome my old friend, Peanut! [audience cheering] [upbeat rock music] Heya, Peanut. Doin’ pretty good. How about you? I’m fine. That’s [gibberish]. That’s good! [laughing] Ha ha! Stop it! Cut it out. So, what’s up, Jeff-fa-fa? As I’ve been telling the other guys, you know we’re going to be shooting a Christmas movie next year. Yes! What’s your favorite part of Christmas? The MILF on a shelf. [audience laughing] Oh, sorry. Elf. Elf, elf, elf on a shelf. Sorry, I get those two mixed up sometimes. Well, my friend’s mom is incredibly hot. Right. And incredibly short. So, “MILF on a shelf.” Stop it. Okay, sorry. [laughing] Ha ha! Stop! [audience laughing] Can’t wait to kiss her under the camelt… Mistletoe, mistletoe, mistletoe! [audience laughing] Mistletoe. Sorry. [audience laughing] Sorry. [laughing] Okay, what’s up? Do you know who I want you to play in A Christmas Carol? The rabbi! No. No. There is no rabbi. No. Really? Racist! Stop it. There’s no rabbi in the original story of A Christmas Carol. You should change that. No, I shouldn’t. Jeff, these days you have to be diverse in your hiring. I know. And equitable. Yes. And inclusive. You’re here. [audience laughing] The hell does that mean? Well, you’re not exactly typical. Oh, really? Well, neither are you. I’m not purple. [audience laughing] I’m “of color.” [audience laughing] No one who is “of color” is purple. [scoffs] Barney? Well… [audience laughs] Grimace? [audience laughing] Peanut, those guys are all fake. You’re real. [audience laughing] I’m just gonna let that hang in the air for a while until everyone figures out you’re a danger to yourself and those around you. [audience laughing] In the movie, I want you to play the Ghost of Christmas Present. Sounds great! Right. You enter Scrooge’s bedroom wearing a robe. Oh, I’ll be like Hugh Hefner. “Hello.” [audience laughing] No, but you tell Scrooge that unless he helps Tiny Tim, the boy will die. Why don’t we make it that Walter dies instead? He’s old. It’s time, Jeff. [audience laughing] Come on, he’s made of wood. So, instead of a cremation, we’ll have a campfire and make s’mores. [audience laughing] That’s terrible. Wait! You said I’m the Ghost of Christmas Present? Yes. So, I give presents? No, not “presents.” I said “present,” as in “now.” I’m changing it. I’m the Ghost of Christmas Presents. Yay! In fact, I have a Christmas present for you, Jeff. For me? Yes. Marnell! What are you doing? It’s okay. I already set up with Marnell. Marnell! Don’t yell at Marnell. I always yell at Marnell. Marnell! Oh, look, there it is. There’s the Christmas present! Look it, look it. Marnell, you gotta help Jeff open it ’cause one of his hands is occupied. Well, I don’t know. You do a lot with one hand, don’t you, Jeff? [audience laughing] [laughing] Ha ha! Stop it! Thank you, Marnell. Marnell. [deeper voice] Marnell. Marnell. [audience laughing] What white guy’s named Marnell? It makes no sense whatsoever. And his last name is White. What the [bleep]? [audience laughing] You know you thought you were diversity hiring when you hired ‘Marnell White,” then that [bleep] showed up. [audience laughing, cheering] [Jeff chuckling, stuttering] Open it! But… [high-pitch voice] Open it, open it, open it! [audience laughing] [mumbling indistinctly] Oh. [scoffs] Look, it’s the Peanut ventriloquist dummy! I’m so excited! Look at that! [audience cheering] So great! Look at that! Tell ’em about the box. The box! Tell ’em about the box! Just the freakin’ box! Okay. So, even the box is great. We made it like a little steamer trunk. It has stickers on it and a handle. It’s easy to carry. And this can be for kids or adults. Way to go, Jeff. You’re doin’ great. Now, show ’em the doll. It’s such a great dummy. It’s handsome. It’s me. It’s so great! [audience laughing] Show ’em! Okay. Here it come, here it comes. [excited laughing] Oh, look, it’s a little Peanut! [squealing] [audience cheering] Yay! So great! Tell them about it. Okay, well, this is actually a very high quality product. It’s a legit ventriloquist dummy. Not a doll! No, it’s not a… No string in the back of the neck! He’s a hollow body. Hollow body! And there’s a stick. A stick! It’s called a head stick. Head stick! And you can move it around. There’s a trigger! Trigger on the stick, and you can make him move like that and make him talk. Show ’em how it works. Show ’em! Show ’em! Show them? Show ’em how it works! You just can’t do it. Show ’em. Oh. All right. [screaming] [audience laughing] What the hell? What did you do? W-what? I’m gonna be in therapy for ten years now! What did you do? I… you wanted me to show them how it works. Not pull his head off! What is wrong with you? [audience laughing] Put it back! You are a sick man deep down. [audience laughing] Okay, so there he is. Anyway, like I said, a high quality product. And even the feet and the hands, I 3D scanned the real Peanut. Yeah, and now I have cancer. [audience laughing] Okay, make him talk. What? Make him talk. Make him… Yeah, make him talk. Okay, but that’s ventriloquism. Right. It’s not easy. No. Lot of practice. Lot of practice! Right? Okay. Good. I mean, first you have to learn how to talk without moving your lips, and then you have to learn how to throw your voice, and then you have to learn how to make your voice different so it’s not the same as yours, and then have to learn how to manipulate it and make him come to life. Jeff, make the [bleep] doll talk. [audience laughing, cheering] Look, I don’t really do this. I just sell the dummy, uh… But I guess I can figure this out. So, uh, once for each syllable… Okay, here we go. [clears throat] Okay. [Southern accent] Hi, look at me! I’m Peanut! I’m just sittin’ up here. I’m an ugly little guy. Look, I got a big purple head, and I got a green thing coming out of the top of my head. I look like a pineapple gone bad! That’s what I look like. [goofy laughter] Hey, look, I got only one shoe. Did I lose a shoe or did I find a shoe? I’m so stupid, I don’t know. Blah…! [audience laughing, cheering] The hell was that? What the hell was what, Big Ugly Peanut? It’s just me, Little Handsome Peanut talking to Big Handsome Jeff. We’re just up here talkin’. Oh, look. Exorcist. Errr… [audience laughing] [goofy laughter] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah… [audience laughing] Payback’s a bitch. [audience laughing, cheering] Okay, first of all, that sounds nothing like me. Oh, well, I don’t do impressions. [audience laughing] No, Ugly Peanut, he doesn’t do impressions. This is just how I talk. [goofy laughter] That sounds stupid. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah… [gibberish noises] [wild laugh] Blah… [audience laughing] I’m gonna [bleep] kill you. [audience laughing] Oh, no! Big Ugly Peanut, don’t drop the f-bomb! People get upset when you do that. He’s gotta talk and tell stupid jokes. Blah, blah. I’m funny, telling stupid jokes. Blurr… [audience laughing] I’m gonna hire Achmed… [audience laughing] …to get on the tour bus, sneak in your bunk, and murder you in your sleep. [audience laughing] Oh, no! Big Ugly Peanut, don’t kill Jeff! ‘Cause if he’s dead, we’re all out of work. [wild laughing] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah… [audience laughing] Are you finished? Yeah, I think so. This wasn’t funny. Oh, it was really funny. I did not like it. I loved it. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Big Peanut… That’s me. And Little Peanut. That’s me. [all three chuckling] [audience cheering] And that’s Peanut, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you! [audience cheering] [Jeff] Thank you. So, there’s a character in my act that I knew would be perfect to play Death. I think many of you know who that is. Please help me welcome the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. [upbeat rock music playing] [audience cheering] [cackling] [vaguely Arabic accent] Greetings and ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas, infidels! [audience cheering] Um, Achmed, why do you have on that hat? I am Santa Claus. No, you’re not. Yes, I am. We are in the movie A Christmas Carol, and I am here, Santa Claus, to bring Christmas joy to all the evil infidel children around the world. [laughing] In the story A Christmas Carol, there is no Santa Claus. What is that line from that old movie, Miracle on 34th Street? Ah, yes. [clears throat] Yes, Virgin, there is a Santa Claus. Achmed… Santa! And I am right here. Ho-ho-ho! Virgin, you need a ho. [audience laughing] Achmed… I am Santa, and I have a Christmas song to sing to Scrooge. Well… It’s called “Deck the Hell.” [clears throat] La la… [to tune of “Deck the Halls”] ♪ Death to my pal, Ebenezer ♪ ♪ Fa la-la la-la, la-la, bye-bye ♪ ♪ You will soon be one dead geezer ♪ ♪ Fa la-la la-la, la-la, you’ll fry ♪ ♪ You can help that Tiny Timmy ♪ ♪ Fa la-la, la-la-la, or turn blue ♪ ♪ Take it from me, the Grim Reaper ♪ ♪ Fa la-la la-la, la… I killed you ♪ [audience cheering] [Achmed] Thank you. Thank you. Achmed, what do you think about becoming an actor? I will not do nude scenes. [audience laughing] It’s not funny! [audience laughing] When I say I am all bone, it is not what you think. [audience laughing] So, are you familiar with A Christmas Carol? Is she really angry like Christmas Karen? [audience laughing] That’s a different thing. I hope so. I’m scared of that crazy lady. [audience laughing] Do you know who visits Scrooge in the middle of the night? [gasps] 72 virgins? [audience laughing] No. Scrooge gets woken up in the middle of the night by three different folks. Oh, Seal Team Six. [audience laughing] I knew a guy that happened to. Yeah? Did not end well for him. No. You’re talking about Usama. Yes. That was awful what happened. Well… Bitch owed me money! [audience laughing] Hey, I was curious. Yes? Is the term ‘elf’ politically correct, or do we now have to call them vertically-challenged North Poleans? [audience laughing] Also, I would like to thank my reindeer for flying me here tonight. Much safer than on Boeing. [audience ooh’s, laughing] Oh, too soon? [audience laughing] Ah, by the time this special airs, it’ll be fine. Okay. [audience laughing] Wait, on second thought, I don’t think I can be Santa. Why not? I’m on a no-fly list. [audience laughing] It’s not funny! [audience laughing] I kill you from here! [laughing] Okay, look, A Christmas Carol takes place at Christmas time. That doesn’t mean there has to be a Santa in our movie. Oh, come on! I’ll be great! And I already did some trading with the real Santa. What? Yeah, I traded him eight of my best goats for eight of his reindeer. What? And they are virgin reindeer. [audience laughing] How do you know if they’re virgin reindeer? Uh, the red nose is still in tact. [audience laughing] [audience cheering] Some of them got it. Some of them didn’t. Okay. [audience laughing] Achmed… Oh, come on, please? I can visit Tiny Tim and bring toys made from Santa’s workshop. Are the toys really made in Santa’s workshop? Uh, yes. [audience laughing] But “Santa’s Workshop” is now the code word for China. [audience laughing] Or as Trump calls it, “Gina.” [audience laughing] [laughing] I was thinking the other day… it’s a good thing China is not in Virginia. Because then Trump would say, “I’m having a rally in Vagina.” [goofy laughter] [audience laughing] [Achmed cackling] You don’t think the elves make the toys now? Well, Chinese kids are very small. No. No. No. [audience laughing] Achmed, you can’t make jokes like that. Too late, and do not call me Achmed. My pronoun is now “Santa.” [audience laughing] Santa is a name, and a name is not a pronoun. It’s a proper noun. You see, this is why you don’t have any friends outside the suitcase. [audience laughing] As Santa, I will have my list of kids who are naughty and nice. And by the way, you know how Santa gets his list? No. The Chinese track the kid on [bleep] TikTok. [audience laughing, cheering] [Achmed] True story. [Jeff chuckling] By the way, did you know I used to be as big as Santa Claus? Yeah, but you know… [clunk] [audience laughing] Look, if I played this ghost, what are my lines? Oh, the ghost you play is silent. Silent? Right. You mean I don’t say anything? That’s correct. Oh. How can I yell “silent” if I’m always silent? [audience laughing] You take Scrooge to a cemetery and simply point at his grave. You want me to point? [audience laughing] A little help. [audience laughing] [audience laughing, cheering] Did my arms just fall off? Holy crap, I really was made in China! [audience laughing] Are they down there? Yeah, they’re down there. Where are they? No, don’t… you’ll hurt… Oh, no! Hold on a second. Look, stop! [indistinct arguing] [screaming] [audience laughing] What the hell? Now what do we do? We can get some barbecue sauce. [audience laughing] [audience cheering] It’s not funny! [audience laughing] ♪ I want my baby back, baby back… ♪ [audience laughing] Not funny! [audience laughing] Put my ribs back on me. [audience laughing] Say please. [audience laughing] [bleep] you. [audience laughing, cheering] Not funny! [audience laughing] Stop laughing, or I will come down and Monty Python it and bite your legs off! [audience laughing] Silent! [audience laughing] You’re gonna go to war? What? Take up arms and… [snickers] …go? [audience laughing, cheering] [mocking] Oh, ha ha ha. [audience laughing] Okay. Looks like you cracked a rib. Shut up! [audience laughing] I remember ’cause I superglued it. Silence! [giggling] [audience laughing] [giggling] [audience laughing] [giggling, snickering] Okay. I hate you! [audience laughing] Get my arms! Holy crap! [audience laughing] I don’t know which one’s left and which one’s right. [audience laughing] I don’t… I don’t know how this goes in here. That’s what she said. [audience laughing] Okay, next one. Look at that. Cut it out! [audience laughing] You’re getting sleepy. Silence! [audience laughing] [Jeff chuckling] Hi. [audience laughing] [audience laughing] Thank you. All right, good to go. Here we go. [audience laughing] Ready? Okay! [audience laughing] [audience cheering] The hell is that? Well, my daughters were cheerleaders, and I, you know… Fix my legs. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Great. [audience laughing] Thank you. Very good. Than… what the…? [audience laughing] Son of a bitch. What the…? [audience laughing] Okay, you’re an asshole. [audience laughing] Cut it out! The [bleep]?! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop touching my wiener! Okay! [audience laughing] Don’t touch your face. You just touch my wiener. I… [audience laughing] All right, back to our movie. Okay. Look, the story takes place in old London. Do you know what the call Santa Claus in England? Hey, you fat American! Get [bleep] off my roof! [audience laughing, cheering] Achmed… I should’ve done that with a British accent. [clears throat] [obnoxious vocal warm-ups] What the hell? [audience laughing] Me with my accent doing a British accent? What the hell does that sound like? I don’t know. Clearly. Because I just tried it, and you almost lost a tonsil. [audience laughing] By the way, what is your accent? You’re asking me? [audience laughing] I… I don’t know. Middle Eastern? Where in the Middle East? Iowa? [audience laughing] I am telling you my fans want to hear me speak. Let’s get some lines for my character. Like what? I don’t know. [clears throat] Hey Scrooge, I’ve got some good news and some bad news. [elderly voice] What’s the bad news? [audience laughing] What the hell was that? [audience laughing] I was acting. Well, don’t. You’re scaring the children. Do it again. [audience laughing] What’s the bad news? If you keep living the way you do, you will be dead by Christmas. What’s the good news? I lost 200 pounds on Ozempic! [audience laughing, cheering] [Achmed laughing] Say goodnight, Achmed. Happy holidays! It’s Achmed, the dead terrorist. I’ll kill you! [audience cheering] [Jeff] Thank you. [Achmed] Infidel! What? [Achmed] Infidel, come back! What? [Achmed] I need you to give this to Peanut! Oh, okay. Yes, I will give this to Peanut for you. There we go. I will give that to Peanut. Very nice. There we go. [audience laughing] All right, so I th… [explosion] [audience laughing] [audience cheering] [coughing] Silence! I’ll kill me! And that’s Achmed, the dead, blown-up terrorist. [audience cheering] You guys have been an awesome audience! Thanks for coming out tonight! We’ll see you next time! Good night! [cheering] [upbeat rock music playing] Thank you guys so much! How about seeing my wife and two little boys? Here are Jack and James. Come on, guys. [audience cheering] And my beautiful wife, Audrey Murdick, ladies and gentlemen! [audience cheering] All right, happy holidays, everybody! And Merry Christmas! See you all next time! Thanks, everybody! Good night! [audience cheering] [rock music version of “O Come All Ye Faithful” playing] [beeping] [explosion]'],\n",
              " 'jim': ['[audience cheering] ♪ My friends all call me Casper ♪ ♪ ‘Cause the sun don’t ever shine on me ♪ ♪ Wanna be, I wanna be lonely ♪ ♪ Wanna be, I wanna be, yeah… ♪ [audience cheering] Thank you, Boston! [applause] Thank you! It is great to be here. I look good. [cheering] I don’t know if you know, I’m normally a fat guy. But, since I’ve lost all this weight, now I’m just… arrogant. [laughter] And by the way, thin people, that’s how we view you, as arrogant bastards. [laughter] I have lost weight. Since I’ve lost weight, I find I get two types of reactions. One group, these people, they won’t even say anything to me. They’ll just go up to my wife and ask, [in high voice] “Is Jim okay?” [laughter] [normal voice] Which sounds like concern, but I just hear judgment. ‘Cause to them, it’s more likely that I’m sick than I would ever have any self-discipline. [laughter] [in high voice] “Well, obviously, Jim’s not exercising and eating healthy.” “He must have cancer.” [laughter] [normal] That’s one group. The other group, these people will come up to me and accuse me of being on an appetite suppressant. They’re like, [in low voice] “You’re on Ozempic! Admit it! You’re on Ozempic!” [normal] And I’m not, alright? I’m on a different one. [laughter, applause] I’m on Mounjaro, which is better, right? ‘Cause it sounds like an Italian restaurant. [gravelly voice] “Welcome to Mounjaro.” “When you’re here, you’re not eatin’ anything “’cause you’re a fat ass. Yeah!” [laughter] [normal] Now, I understand some people are against the appetite suppressants. You know, they’re like, [nasal] “That’s cheating. It’s cheating.” [normal] I’m not playing Major League baseball. I’m just a fat guy trying to not die. [nasal] “But it’s not fair!” [normal] Yeah, neither is balding and being born with no pigmentation. [laughter] But I’ve learned to deal with it. This is an exciting time for me! I’m thin, I’m in my 30s… [audience laughing] It is crazy. Most of my adult life, I heard this constant internal monologue. [deep voice] “Jim, you gotta stop eating. Jim, you gotta control your impulses.” [normal] And now, I know all I needed was a weekly shot that killed all the passion inside of me. [audience laughing] I’ve learned so much! I now understand thin people. You don’t forget to eat. You’re dead inside. [audience laughing] Life is about compromise! Sure, I may never feel true joy again but I can finally fit in my clothes that went out of style 30 years ago. So, it’s not a bad deal. It’s crazy. These appetite suppressants are a game changer. Here’s what’s gonna happen. All us fat people are gonna become thin. Then, we’re gonna mix in with you thin bastards. [scattered laughter] And when you’re not looking, we’re gonna eat you. [loud laughter] Doesn’t matter if we’re hungry. We just like to eat. Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom! It is amazing how popular the appetite suppressants are, right? ‘Cause we live in this age of… [high voice] body positivity. Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. [normal] Oh, this drug will make you not hungry. [high voice] Give it to me or I’ll kill you. [audience laughing] I’m trying to enjoy being thin, you know, ’cause I know I’m gonna be fat again. [laughter] I mean… this is not sustainable. [laughter] This is the drug! This is like 99% Big Pharma, 1% little Jim. [laughter] Right? I mean… [applause] Right? [audience cheering] Besides, I still got my fat clothes! ¿I’m not a fool. [laughter] I see ’em hanging in my closet, taunting me. [growls] [laughter] [gravelly voice] “You’ll be back!” “You’ll be wearin’ me. “‘Member that time you ate an entire pizza and told your wife it never came?” [growls] [laughter] “That’s who you really are.” [normal] The drug changes your attitude towards food. I now view McDonald’s like some weird crush I had. I’m like… [scoffs], “I can’t believe I was so into you.” [audience laughing] “Meet me at midnight, and please don’t tell my wife.” Appetite suppression wasn’t even the intended use. The drug was created to help people with diabetes or something stupid. [audience laughing] But, once it got out that there was a diabetes medicine that made people not crave donuts, every fat person was like… [low voice] “I just got diabetes.” [laughter] “Oh, ah, my diabetes is kickin’ in.” [normal] It’s not the first drug with a beneficial side effect, right? We know about Viagra, the contraceptive pill cures acne, and, of course, alcohol makes people attractive. [audience laughing] But it must be frustrating for these scientists that develop these life-changing drugs, and we fixate on a side effect. Like the people that created Viagra, they were probably so excited at that press conference. They’re like, [smart voice] “Ah, ah, well, [laughs]” “After decades of hard work, my team and I have developed this pill, “which will save the lives of men suffering from high blood pressure. “Now, uh, th-there are some minor side effects. “Uh, nausea, dizziness, uh, you get a huge boner, but…” [laughter] “But, most importantly, “this is a lifesaving blood pressure medicine. Any questions?” [dumb voice] “Uh, yeah, the boner part?” [laughter] “H-How long does the boner last?” [smart] “Well, th-that’s not really important, but four hours.” [dumb] “Jesus Christ.” [laughter] [smart] “Uh, I-if we could focus on the fact that this is a life-saving blood pressure medicine.” [dumb] “Uh, I got a blood pressure question.” [audience laughs] “Say I had high blood pressure, and I was going on a date to, let’s say, an orgy.” [laughter] “When would be the optimal time to take your boner pill… I mean, blood pressure medicine?” [audience laughing] [normal] I’m sure there’s some men in the audience who take Viagra, and by some, I mean every guy over the age of 40. [laughter] And, by the way, if you do take Viagra, you shouldn’t be embarrassed. It doesn’t mean you’re not a man. It just means the body part that defines you as a man doesn’t work. [audience laughing] You’re like a eunuch, and they’re manly! [audience member] Woo! Now, there are some men over the age of 40 who don’t take Viagra, and they’re called “celibate.” [laughter] But heck, I’ve taken Viagra! You know, just for the high blood pressure. [laughter] And the articles. [laughter, applause] The articles are amazing. [cheering] We live in this age of incredible medical and technological advancement. I know people are worried about artificial intelligence. [deep voice] “AI’s gonna take over. AI’s gonna take over.” [normal] I hope so. [laughter] I’m exhausted! I feel like my intelligence has taken me as far as I’m gonna get. [laughter] I need artificial intelligence. I was reading this article, “Will AI Take Over?” I was halfway through before I realized it wasn’t about a guy named Al. [audience laughing] “Will Al Take Over.” I thought it was about Al Roker. And his love of A1. [soft voice] “Jim, that’s a dumb joke.” [laughter] [normal] I feel like most of the technological advancements are wasted on me. You know, like, I still struggle with Wi-Fi passwords. Like, even if the password’s written down right in front of me, I’m like, “I’m probably not gonna be able to do this.” [laughter] It’s just like six or eight letters or numbers, and I feel like I’m taking the SATs. I’m like… [scoffs], “I-I need more time.” [laughter] [sighs] I shoulda slept better last night.” You ever have someone tell you a Wi-Fi password? “Oh, our Wi-Fi password, it’s super easy. “It’s just beagle, all lowercase. And the E’s a three, and the G’s an eight, and the last E’s an F.” [audience laughing] Uh, yeah, but h-how do you spell beagle? [laughter, applause] Technology is getting more complicated. I miss the simpler times. Like, remember when you used to be able to choose your own password? ‘Cause now, you have to get approval, and they always kinda give you an attitude, like, [tough voice] “Yeah, that password’s not strong enough.” [laughter] “That password’s very weak.” [normal] You’re like, “I don’t care. Just use it.” [laughter] [tough] “Nah, I don’t accept that password. Pick another one.” [normal] So, you put in a password. They’re like, [tough voice] “Yeah, that password’s too easy to guess.” [normal] That’s ’cause you just saw me type it in. [laughter] [tough] “Eh, pick another one.” Yeah, you already used that password. Pick another one.” [normal] I get writer’s block when it comes to passwords. [tough] “Pick another one.” [normal] I-I think I’m out. I already used my birthday. I don’t have any more. [laughter] The criteria for passwords is ridiculous. [tough] “Now, your password must have a capital letter, a number”, a character, a rabbit’s foot, something your mom wore at her wedding.” [audience laughing] Sometimes, they offer a password. That’s kind of humiliating. [tough voice] “Hey, dummy, you want us to just give you a password?” [laughter] [normal] Doesn’t that defeat the whole point? [tough] “Well, we won’t tell anyone.” [audience laughing] “You can trust us. We’re a faceless algorithm “created by a multinational corporation.” [laughter] “We won’t share your password.” [applause] [normal] Wh-Why… Are you winking? [tough] “No, no, no, I just got some dust in my AI.” [audience laughing] [applause, cheering] I’ve let them pick my password. You ever do that? Their password just looks like they let a cat walk on a keyboard. [laughter] Well, I coulda come up with that. [tough voice] “Yeah, but you didn’t, did you, dummy?” [normal] Well, I-I’m never gonna be able to remember that. [tough] “Well, we’ll remember it for you, dumb-ass!” You just let us know when you need it.” [normal] W-Well, can I have it now? [tough] “No!” [laughter] “We don’t know, you might be a robot.” [normal] Wait, aren’t you a robot? [tough] “Yeah, but you don’t know that. You’re so dumb.” [normal] You ever forget your password, and they make you take that quiz with the photos? [tough voice] “Hey, idiot! You see a stoplight in any of these photos?!” [laughter] [normal] For a second, you’re like, w-wait, what’s a stoplight again? I always overthink it, and I’m like, well, that pole could be connected to a stoplight. [laughter, applause] Is there partial credit? I usually just guess, but when I get it right, I’m like, I’m good at the stoplight game. [laughter] Made it to the next level. Now, I’m allowed to check my own email. [laughter] They’re so condescending to us. [condescending voice] “You accept these cookies?” [normal] Cookies? [laughter] You know someone was like, [gravelly voice] “Just tell the idiots they’re cookies.” [normal] And we’re like, “Cookies? I like cookies.” “I’m gonna accept all the cookies. Can I accept milk with the cookies?” They present it like it’s a gift. [condescending] “Do you accept these cookies?” [dumb voice] “Well, gosh, I don’t wanna be rude.” [condescending] “The polite thing is to accept the cookies and let us track your internet activity.” [dumb] “As long as I get them cookies.” [audience laughing] We’re so accepting of all of it. You ever been in a conversation with someone where you’re talking about a vacation destination, and then, the next time you’re online, you start seeing ads for that destination? [audience member] Yeah. And instead of being outraged that your privacy was obviously invaded, you just book the trip. [audience laughing] “Looks like we’re going to Mexico!” [oafish laughter] I’m convinced technology’s making us delusional. The way everyone talks about going to Mars now, it’s like, [dumb voice] “We’re going to Mars!” We’re going to Mars! I can’t wait to go to Mars!” [normal] I don’t think they were talking about you. [laughter] Why do you think you’re going to Mars? You haven’t been to Minnesota. They weren’t inviting us. I’m pretty sure they were just bragging. Jeff Bezos did take his brother to outer space. I have three brothers, and I don’t even wanna buy them dinner. [laughter] I appreciate the optimism, but are we going to Mars? We put a man on the moon 54 years ago. And you know how many times we put a man on the moon after that? Zero. You know why? ‘Cause we never put a man on the moon. [audience laughing] I don’t know. I don’t know. [laughter] I don’t know, maybe we put a man on the moon. I don’t know. Maybe we’re going to Mars. Honestly, I-I don’t know how a microwave works. [laughter] Like, if someone put a gun to my head, and they’re like, “Explain the microwave!” I’d be like, “Ah!” [laughter] “A light turns on. It rotates. “When the bell rings, your hot dog’s done. “Is that close?” [laughter] There is so much I don’t know. Most of the time, I don’t even feel like an adult. I still don’t feel comfortable buying shoes in a store. Shoes are the only clothing we let an absolute stranger put on us. You’d never go up to a salesperson, “Will you put these pants on me?” [laughter] Wh-Where are you going?” Yet, when we buy shoes, we become helpless. We just sit down and we’re like, [grumbles] “You do it.” [laughter] My mommy’s not here, so you have to do it.” And we know nothing about these people putting shoes on our feet. There’s no background check. All we know is they like to work with stranger’s feet. Everything they say is kinda creepy. [creepy voice] “How do they feel?” [laughter] [normal] “Excuse me?” [creepy] “Are they tight?” [laughter] [normal] “I-I beg your pardon?” [creepy] “Is that your big toe?” [laughter] [normal] “How dare you.” [creepy] “Why don’t you walk around the store, show me how cute you look in that outfit?” [normal] “Well, since you asked nicely.” [audience laughing] I’ve decided I’m gonna stop acting like I understand things I know nothing about. Like the stock market. When they talk about the stock market in the news like, [gravelly] “The stock market today, rah rah rah rah rah rah!” [normal] I normally go, “Oh, that’s interesting.” On the inside, I’m like, [dumb] “Duh!” Stock market, duh…” [normal] The saddest part of that, in college, I majored in finance. [laughter] [applause] I did. I really did. [laughs] Four years, 80,000 [dumb] dollars! [laughter] [normal] I’m so glad this is what I do for a living. But, I tell you, the pandemic… the pandemic did reveal how important your occupation is to society. And let’s just say stand-up comedian, not essential. [laughter] Not even sential. They opened up strip clubs before they let us tell a joke. “Stay over there, funny people. Ladies, welcome back.” [audience laughing] It didn’t surprise me! There isn’t a time in history when I think I would’ve been useful. Even in an initial civilization. “We need someone to gather water, someone to build housing. Jim, how could you help?” “Uh, I can make fun of those people.” [audience laughing] It’s weird. I work in the entertainment industry, and I understand there’s a commonly held belief that people that work in show business are narcissists, that are grossly overpaid for unimportant jobs, but, believe me, it’s amazing. [laughter, applause] It is a sweet gig. [applause, cheering] Of course, there are some people in the entertainment industry that have unique skills that are properly compensated. I’m talking about once-in-a-generation talents, right? You know, someone like Pat Sajak. [laughter] Former host of Wheel of Fortune. Was there anything Pat Sajak couldn’t do? Think about this. He was the host of Wheel of Fortune… [inhales] [audience laughing] He was like a Renaissance man. I’m sure Pat Sajak’s a good guy. And I love Wheel of Fortune, and I’m not even 80. [laughter] I love Wheel of Fortune. So when he announced his retirement, I was kinda bummed, you know? And he seems like a good guy, so he probably gathered everyone from the Wheel of Fortune family together, and he was like, “I’ve been doing this for a couple decades, and I’ve decided to retire.” I wish I was there ’cause if I was there, I woulda been like, “You know this isn’t a real job, right?” [laughter] “You don’t get to retire from playing Hangman.” [laughter] “The appropriate thing to do is to apologize and give back all the money.” [laughter] ‘Cause Pat Sajak had a good gig. You know how much he made a year? $17 million a year. [audience gasps] Yeah, that could buy a couple vowels. [audience laughing] 17 mill… And he didn’t even turn the letters! That was probably part of the negotiation. He’s like, “I can’t do everything!” [laughter] So, they got Vanna White. He made 17 million. Vanna made 3 million. I think we’d all agree, they both should make… nothing. [audience laughing] [Jim laughs] When he announced his retirement, were the producers like, “Oh, no! “This is awful. Where are we gonna find someone to say, ‘It’s your turn to spin the wheel’?” [audience laughing] The good news, there is good news, Pat Sajak is continuing on as a consultant on the show. [laughter] I-I don’t know what consulting work… there is on the Wheel of Fortune. [laughs] “Uh, any new letters come out today?” [laughing, applause] “No, Pat. Still the same 26 letters.” “Alright, well, I-I’ll be in my office.” [audience laughing] [Jim muttering] I love doing stand-up comedy. Occasionally, I’ll be hired for an acting job. And sometimes, the directors of these projects will say to me like, “Jim, I think I’d like to see you clean-shaven.” And I’d be like, “I don’t think you do.” [laughter] I always do it, but after I shave my beard, I am so disgusted with my appearance. [laughter] I walk around feeling like I should apologize. Sorry. Sorry about this. [laughter] Oh, you’re eating. Sorry. And it’s not just me. It’s shocking to everyone who knows me with a beard. And they don’t hold back. They’re like, “Ew, gross! Where’s your beard?” And those are just my children. [laughter] ‘Cause a beard is really the poor man’s facelift. Every compliment a man receives on his beard is backhanded. “I like your face with a beard.” “Oh, so it’s better covered in hair.” [laughter] “Thanks.” I feel sorry for women. Some women can’t grow a beard. [laughter] You know? What you must understand is every man who has a beard needs that beard. Every man who has a beard at one point looked in the mirror, bare-faced, and was like, “I gotta hide this.” [laughter] Think of all the significant historical figures who had beards probably ’cause they were insecure. Abraham Lincoln. Karl Marx. Gandalf. [laughter] They all had beards. Jesus! Jesus had a beard. Jesus was probably walking on water, looked down, saw his reflection, was like, “Jesus!” [laughter, applause] [cheering] “I gotta grow a beard. I’m not gonna get any followers looking like this.” [laughter] By the way, this is how Jesus walked. [laughter] When Jesus walked on water, did he act like it was difficult? Was he like, “Oh…” [laughter] “Can you believe it? “I’m walking on water! Take out your phone! Get this!” [laughter] Or did he walk with, like, an attitude like, “Yeah, that’s right, bitches. Look at this.” [audience laughing] “Yass, king of kings!” Of course, that was… Walking on water was one of Jesus’ miracles, but you know someone there probably just thought it was a magic trick. Someone came out, “Hey, I saw your, uh, walking on water show. “Pretty cool. I book children’s birthday parties.” [laughter] We could make a killing.” And Jesus was like, “It wasn’t a magic trick. I’m the Son of God.” “Interesting stage name.” [laughter] Anyway, here’s my card. My name’s Judas.” [laughter, applause] All that’s in the Bible, everyone. [laughter] It’s in the Bible. There is some wild stuff in the Bible, right? Like early on, God asked Abraham to sacrifice his only son. God asked Abraham to kill his only son. And Abraham, like most fathers, said, “Alright, I’ll do it.” [audience laughing] In his defense, we don’t know what Abraham was doing right before God asked him. Maybe Abraham was going through bills and was like, “Wh-who spent 500 shekels on Nintendo?” [laughter, applause] And then right at that moment, God was like, “Abraham, I want you to sacrifice your only son.” Abraham’s like, “Gladly!” [laughter] Can it be a strangle sacrifice?” God was communicating with Abraham from Heaven. I don’t know if he was yelling down. Did anyone overhear the conversation? Like, was there anyone up there in Heaven? Was Jesus up in Heaven? Was God like, “Abraham, I want you to sacrifice your only son!” And Jesus was like, “Dad, what the hell are you doing?!” [laughter] God was like, “Uh, we’ve been through this before. “Just mind your own business.” [laughter] “Pay no attention to that bearded hippie! “Abraham, I’d like you to sacrifice your only son.” Jesus was like, “Dad, you can’t ask Abraham to sacrifice his only son!” And God was like, “Uh, that gives me an idea.” [groaning, laughter] “Jesus, I’d like you to go down to Earth, and, uh, tell the humans I’m your dad.” And Jesus is like, “If I go down there, if I tell the humans you’re my dad”, they might get angry. They might hurt me.” And God’s like, [sarcastic] “No…” [laughter] Why would they do that? They seem so nice down there.” Jesus is like, “Alright, if I go down there and they start to hurt me”, you’ll stop ’em.” And God’s like, “Yeah, definitely. Probably, maybe. [audience laughing] “Yeah…” Abraham was rewarded for his loyalty, right? He got to live to the age of 175. He died when he was 175, which is cool. But, those last 90 years… [laughter] Yikes, right? Do you think when they were first writing down the Bible, anyone was like, “Wait, do we really wanna put 175? “I mean, we want people to read this, right?” [laughter] “Why don’t we just put 75? “You know, that’s a good run. I could see it. “Mediterranean diet. That could happen. [laughter] “You know?” 175. If you met someone today, and they’re like, “My grandpa lived to 175,” you’d be like, “You’re mentally ill.” [laughter] Could you imagine if you lived to 175? You’re like, “Yeah, I retired at 60.” “Had no idea I had another 115 years to go.” [laughter] “How much pickleball am I supposed to play?” [cheering, applause] Like, geez. [cheering, applause] Thank you. Thank you. That was Abraham’s reward. He got to live to 175. He also is a founding figure of not just one religion, but three religions, right? Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which is amazing. You know what’s even more amazing? Those three religions, best buddies. [audience laughing] They get along great, no problems. Does Abraham feel any responsibility? Does he ever look down from Heaven, like, “Yikes!” [laughter] “I-I didn’t do that…” God used to be so much more involved. God was so hands-on. Talking to Abraham, floods, plagues. Now, He’s just like, “You know what?” “Just put Jesus’ face on a piece of toast.” [audience laughing] [sighs] “I just can’t even, you know?” “No, if they’re not gonna listen, I’m not gonna try!” [laughter] I guess the point I’m trying to make is I’m a Christian. [laughter] And the reason I say that is to make you feel uncomfortable. ‘Cause when non-Christians hear me say I’m a Christian, they think, “Oh, no.” And when Christians hear me say I’m a Christian, they think, “Oh, no.” [laughter] So, it’s a way to bring the crowd together. [applause, laughter] [applause, cheering] Thank you so much for coming out, by the way. I do appreciate it. [cheering] Yeah. Thank you. [applause] Um… I’m so grateful that I can travel around doing stand-up comedy, but I do need you to know that my life at home is horrible. [laughter] I have five children. It’s like hell. My life at home is actually the opposite of this experience. Like, when I came out, you guys greeted me with applause. At home, I’m not even acknowledged. [laughter] And I’m not suggesting parents should be greeted with applause. That’s not enough. [laughter, cheering] I think parents should receive a standing ovation. There should be an announcer. [cheering] “Please welcome, the only reason you’re alive.” [applause, laughter] Right? [cheering] ‘Cause, parenting is an impossible task! It’s too hard! The expectations are too high. In baseball, if I have a .300 average, if I get a hit three times outta 10, I’m good. Yet, if I hit my kid once… [audience laughing] I’m bad at it? Children, children are the only thing we remove from the human body, and then keep. [audience laughing] You know? [applause, cheering] You never hear someone say, “That’s my appendix. That’s my son. “Neither of ’em work.” [audience laughing] I do believe parents, we deserve this pain. We deserve the pain. The audacity, the audacity to think you’re equipped to be a parent. And we just arrogantly jump into this responsibility. We’re just like, “Yeah, yeah, I lose my phone once a day.” [laughter] “I could take care of a baby.” [laughter] “Can you call my baby?” “Call my baby!” Now, I’m aware not everyone here is a parent. You know, you have a child, you become a parent. You never have a child, you just remain happy. [audience laughing] Not everyone wants to be a parent. Some choose to not have children, and I respect that. I do. But, I don’t think those people should be considered adults. [laughter] How are they different from giant toddlers? What stress is keeping them awake at night? [whiny voice] “Where am I gonna go for brunch?” [laughter] If you’re over the age of 30, and the biggest problem in your life is your Wi-Fi connection, you’re not an adult. [laughter] If you’ve never been out, discovered a stain, and privately prayed that it was chocolate… [laughter, applause] You’re not an adult. If you haven’t bragged to your spouse or partner that you haven’t had time to shower for three days, you’re not an adult. And you might be a redneck. [laughter, applause] There’s no comparison. One has a rich, fulfilling life, and the other is a parent. [laughter] There should be a whole other classification. Oh, you’re over 30, no kids? You’re a junior adult. How was brunch? [laughter] By the way, can we admit brunch was just the rationalization of some alcoholic? [laughter] Someone’s like, “You can’t drink alcohol at breakfast.” [slurred] “It’s not breakfast.” “It’s brunch.” [laughter, applause] “What?” [slurred] “It’s breakfast. It’s lunch. It’s… Happy birthday!” [laughter, applause] Everything about brunch is ridiculous. You obviously slept through breakfast. [laughter] And now, you’re demanding French toast at 1:00 p.m. while you get loaded on mimosas. [laughter] Tell me the mimosa wasn’t the brainchild of a drunk? [slurred] “Do you have fresh-squeezed orange juice? “You do? Pour in some champagne.” [laughter] “We’ll call it a m…mosa.” [laughter] [normal] Mimosa even sounds like that unreliable coworker. “Mimosa, where’s the quarterly report?” [slurred] “I’m working on it!” [laughter] “Who wants to go get linner?” “It’s lunch. It’s dinner. It’s… happy birthday!” I’m sensitive to the fact some people physically can’t have children, but there is adoption. And we learn from an early age through movies like Annie and Oliver that there are children out there that need parents, and many of those kids can sing and dance. [laughter] So, have a heart. Support the arts, people. [audience laughing] I certainly don’t care if someone has kids. I think it’s weird some of the pressure we put on people. Some of the things we say, like people go, [snide voice] “Well, who’s gonna take care of you in your old age?” “Who’s gonna take care of you in your old age?” And I’m like, “Well, not my children.” [laughter] Let me understand the logic here. My kids, who’ve done nothing but bleed me dry… are suddenly gonna wake up and take care of me? That feels like a gamble. [audience laughing] By the way, I’m not worried about my kids putting me in an old folks home. They’re not that resourceful. “I gotta fill out forms? Just stick him in the garage.” [laughter, applause] If you don’t have kids, here’s a story which embodies the joy of parenting. I have five children, so I try to do one-on-one time with each of them. That way, I know I’ve met them all. [laughter] Last February, I took my then 10-year-old son for a walk. We walked our dog, and before we left, I said, “Hey, it’s pretty cold out there. You might wanna grab a coat.” He’s like, [angry voice] “I’m not wearing a coat! That’s stupid! You can’t make me!” [normal] I was like, “Fine, you don’t have to wear a coat.” So we went for the walk and as we turned to walk back, he looked at me and asked, [sad voice] “Dad, can I have your coat?” [laughter] [normal] And I didn’t hesitate, right? Because being a parent is like being a psychic who’s constantly correct, but always ignored. [laughter, applause] Right? [applause, cheering] All day, every day, parents are like, “Let me look into my crystal ball. Ooh, it’s pretty cold out there. You might wanna grab a coat.” [angry] “You’re fat.” [laughter] [normal] “Oh, if you stay up late, you may be tired in the morning.” [angry] “You’re bald.” [normal] “Ooh, I foresee economic hardship when I kick you out of this house.” [laughter] It’s not their fault. Children don’t understand consequences. Parents understand consequences. They’re called children. [laughter] Children are walking, talking consequences. That’s why every parent occasionally looks at their kid and thinks, “I know I shouldn’t have gotten wasted that night.” [laughter] It is wild how different the childhood my kids are having from the one I had. Like, I remember when I was 10 years old, my mom used to send me on errands. I remember one time, she sent me to the grocery store with very specific instructions. I walked a mile and a half to the grocery store, and I did what I was told. I went right up to the cashier, handed her $10 and said, “My mom sent me here to buy a carton of cigarettes. “Merit Ultra Lights.” [laughter] The cashier looked at me and asked, “How old are you?” And I said, “I’m 10 years old.” She said, “You’re a good boy.” [laughter, applause] She complimented me, gave me the cigarettes and my change, and I walked home, smoking the entire way. [applause] We used to send children on errands alone. But now, after 25 years of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, we don’t feel safe having them open a refrigerator. I used to like the independence, you know? I mean, I was definitely scared here and there. I was mostly afraid of grown-ups. Grown-ups were just these evil giants that somehow all knew each other. [gravelly voice] “I know your father.” [audience laughing] [normal] “How?” [creepy voice] “I held you as a baby.” [normal] “Why?” [laughter] My friends growing up were afraid of my dad. You know? My, my childhood best friend, to this day, is still afraid of my dad. My dad’s been dead for 30 years. [laughter] My kids, their friends, they view me as an Uber driver. And they’ve requested a silent ride. [audience laughing] [snarky voice] “Can we turn down the music, Jim?” [normal] I’ll kill you. [audience laughing] I mean… I know your parents. I’ll kill them, too. [audience laughing] Parenting is about sacrifice, right? Some big, some small. Do you know how many horrible kids’ movies I’ve seen? In the theater? [laughter] I’ve voluntarily driven, purchased multiple tickets, and sat through absolute garbage. Objectively bad movies. Like, I didn’t need to read a review. I didn’t need to watch a trailer. Nobody asks themselves like, “I wonder if The Smurfs is a good film.” [laughter] It’s not! They tried to warn us by calling it The Smurfs! I have five children. I’ve been going to horrible kids’ movies for 15 years. A decade and a half of torture. And the hardest part, the self-censorship. ‘Cause after you sit through a movie like Trolls or My Pretty Pony, if you’re a normal adult, you need to turn to someone and go, “Well, that was horseshit.” [laughter] You know? But you can’t say that to an 8-year-old! So, you just ask, [happy voice] “Hey, what’d you think?” Yeah, I hope they make another one, too!” [laughter] [normal] And they do. They make five more. And you sit through each of them, just thinking about alcohol. [laughter] My father, my father would’ve never sat through a horrible kids’ movie. On the rare occasion my dad took us to a movie, we were never consulted! [laughter] We didn’t know what movie we were gonna see. He didn’t know what movie we were gonna see! It was understood that when we got to the theater, he was gonna pick a movie, buy tickets, and we were gonna walk in immediately. Didn’t matter when the movie started, that was the beginning of the movie for us. We’d walk into the dark theater, sit down, watch the last third of a movie… [laughter] The lights would turn on, people would leave, we’d just sit there trying to figure out what the hell we just saw. We might ask each other like, “How do you think the movie starts?” [laughter] Then a new crowd would come in. The lights would turn off. The movie would start. We’d watch to a certain point. Then, my dad would just stand up and leave. [laughter] And we’d follow him out. That’s how we saw movies as a family! And I kinda miss it. Often, it felt like we were just helping my dad establish an alibi. [laughter] “I couldn’t have killed that drifter. I was at the movies with my kids.” I do wish we could’ve seen The Sound of Music as a family with my father. You know, just halfway through The Sound of Music, my father stands up, starts to leave, followed by his six blonde children. [laughter, applause] Everyone in the theater’s like, “Wow, that family didn’t like it when Captain von Trapp tore up that Nazi flag at all.” [audience laughing] That joke was even funnier when everyone hated Nazis. [audience cheering] Right? [applause] I know I complain a lot about my kids, but they’ve ruined my life. [laughter] I love them, but they treat me horribly! And people without kids are always like, “I’d never let my kids treat me horribly.” Oh yeah, you would. [laughter] You know what the alternative is? Jail. [laughter] So you let them treat you horribly, and you just think about alcohol. I was thinking if I told a therapist how my kids treat me, but I didn’t say they were my children, if I was like, “Yeah, I live with these five people. They eat all my food. “They spend all my money, and when I ask them to do anything, they just yell at me.” [laughter] Any therapist, any therapist would be like, “You should move out.” [laughter] You’re the victim of abuse.” I love them, and I know they love me. I mean, even though when my 18-year-old son does say, “I love you,” it does sound like he’s auditioning for an acting part he really doesn’t want. [lethargic voice] “Love you, Dad.” [normal] “Okay, that was a good start. Let’s try it again.” [laughter] “Uh, this time, I wanna hear some more affection, maybe sense a relationship.” [lethargic] “Love you, Dad.” [laughter] [normal] “Alright, well, we’ll let you know. Thanks for coming in.” [audience laughing] Alright… [applause, cheering] Parenting is hard, and it gets progressively harder. That’s what they don’t tell you when you have a baby. I guess it would be inappropriate. “Congratulations. It’s gonna get really hard.” [laughter] So, as a new parent, you have to figure it out on your own. And a baby, a newborn, they’re so fragile, they’re so dependent. You help them burp. The new parent thinks, “Oh, this must be the hard part. This is the hard part.” Not the hard part. [laughter] Then the child becomes a toddler. It’s chaos. They’re screaming in grocery stores. You’re literally stopping them from accidentally killing themselves. The parent thinks, “Oh, this is the hard part. This is the hard part.” Not the hard part. [laughter] Then, the child becomes a teenager, and the parents are like, “Oh, this whole thing was a mistake.” [laughter, applause] “We shouldn’t have done this.” [audience cheering] [Jim sighs] Parenting is the only thing you can do for 13 years, 13 years, and then suddenly, you’re really bad at it. [audience laughing] It’s God’s cruelest joke ’cause you know he’s sitting up there, just watching. He’s like… [maniacal laughter] “They think they’re pretty good at the parenting thing, huh? “Watch this.” [laughter] “Cue the hormones!” [maniacal laughter] This reminds me of when Jesus was a teenager. You know, he used to vape. [applause, laughter] Anyone here have a teenager? [applause, cheering] Ooh… I love that forced enthusiasm. [laughter] The best is when empty nesters talk about the teenage years ’cause they always sound like they’re describing a hurricane. “My wife and I thought we were prepared. We lost everything.” [audience laughing] That’s why hurricanes are named after teenagers. Teenagers do make you realize parenting’s a skill, but it’s mostly luck, right? ‘Cause there are easy teenagers, and there are difficult teenagers. And if you have an easy teenager, that doesn’t mean you’re good at parenting. It just means God didn’t think you could handle a hard one. [audience laughing] Parenting teenagers has made me a better comedian. No, that’s… that’s not it. [laughter] A bitter comedian! [laughter] I know that sounds negative, but it is almost sad when a kid becomes a teenager, right? ‘Cause you have this cute 12-year-old, and then boom, they become Satan. [laughter] You can literally witness the curiosity and wonder transform into body odor and poor judgment. [laughter] And then, you, the parent, you’re supposed to learn how to communicate with them! My wife emails me articles, “How to talk to your teenager.” I’m like, “Delete.” [audience laughing] [applause, cheering] She’s always like, [whiny] “How do you expect to communicate with our teenagers?” [normal] I’m gonna try English. [audience laughing] They do hear things differently. Like, if I tell my 14-year-old daughter, “Hurry up, we’re running late,” she hears, “I’m gonna kill you.” [laughter] But then, we talk it through and come to an agreement that I’m a horrible person. [laughter] And then, I go drink alcohol. Do you ever notice in commercials for alcohol, people are always laughing and having a good time? I’d just like to see one print ad that shows some expressionless dad sitting alone at a kitchen table with a bottle of booze. [audience laughing] [applause, cheering] The tagline would be like, “Bourbon, ’cause you’re trapped and suicide’s off the table.” [audience laughing] Is that too negative? That’s too negative. [Jim laughs] There are teenagers in the audience like, “Why the hell am I here?” [audience laughing] “I had no idea this guy was such a colossal dick.” [laughter] We should acknowledge being a teenager today is the hardest it’s been in generations. What these teenagers have to deal with, it’s insane. [applause, cheering] Right? Social media, the prevalence of drugs, pornography’s everywhere. I guess what I’m saying is I wish I was a teenager. [laughter] I had to walk a mile and a half for cigarettes. I think the greatest irony of teenagers is that they’re embarrassed of their parents. It’s like, “Oh, you’re embarrassed of me?” [audience laughing] “Have you looked in the mirror?” Each of my teenagers has come up to me at different points and been like, “Hey, can you act like you don’t know me?” [laughter] We can make that permanent. [applause, laughter] It’s amazing how consistent the theme of embarrassment is throughout parenting, right? ‘Cause when your kids are little, they’re constantly embarrassing you, right? Some of the things they say or scream, they’re like, [whiny] “Why is that guy so fat?” [laughter] “Is that woman a witch?” [sighs] “Jews! Jews!” [laughter] “It’s juice!” [laughter] “Juice! “Please say juice.” [laughing, applause] That actually happened to me. I was in a Whole Foods in New York City… [audience groaning] And my two blonde children were screaming for Jews. [laughter] They were demanding Jews in a way that would lead you to believe they’ve been delivered Jews before. [laughter] “Jews, Jews.” “Juice! Juice! “For the love of Jesus, please say juice.” [laughter] [nervous laugh] “They love juice.” “Not Jews. I mean, they love Jews, too!” [laughter] “They get that from me. I’m a Jew lover. [nervous laugh] “Love me some Jews.” [applause] Your kids consistently embarrass you. And then one day, out of nowhere, you’re the biggest source of humiliation in their life! [laughter] They don’t tell you when that happens, and there are strict rules that you only learn about when you break them. [laughter] I was at dinner recently, and my 14-year-old daughter was like, [whiny] “And then, Dad walked into the high school.” [audience laughing] [normal] My wife was like, “Honey, you didn’t go into the school, did you?” [laughter] “But, but… i-it was cold out.” “Wh-What planet are we on?” [audience laughing] We have three teenagers plus a 12-year-old plus an 11-year-old. Forecast, not great. [laughter] Definitely hurricane season. And I freely admit my wife has it harder, much harder, but this whole thing is kind of her fault. These children didn’t come outta my body. In a way, they’re not even my kids. [laughter] Now, I don’t wanna sound like a conspiracy theorist, but that whole sperm fertilizing the egg thing? I’ve never seen that in person. [laughter] I’ve seen a simulation of it. You know, how you might stage a landing on the moon? [laughter] Men should be suspicious. Women discover they’re gonna become a parent. Men are told. [laughter] Men find out they’re gonna be a father the same way they learn they have a terminal illness. [laughter] Someone comes up and goes, “You should sit down.” And men have a similar response. [hoarse voice] “How much time do I got?” [applause, laughter] Of course, with paternity tests, now we can scientifically prove who the father is, but for most of human existence, the guy just had to believe what he was told. [high voice] “I’m pregnant. You’re the father.” [normal] “I haven’t been home for two years.” [laughter] [high voice] “It’s a miracle.” [normal] Occasionally, you’ll hear about a paternity test. You never hear about a maternity test though. [audience laughing] How do we really know who the mother is? “Uh, the child came out of my body.” Well then, you shouldn’t be afraid to take a test. [laughter] Okay, Jim, that’s the dumbest joke of the night. That one? [scoffs] Obviously, paternity tests exist because some men are garbage. And I tell you, as the father of five, when I hear about these men that abandon their children, I am so filled with jealousy. [laughter] There’s no excuse. [laughs] There’s no excuse. But, nothing prepares a man for parenthood. Like, a woman goes through a whole physiological change. Not only growing the baby, but there’s morning sickness, a nesting instinct takes over. For a guy during the entire pregnancy, they feel the same, worthless. [laughter] Which, in a way, prepares them for fatherhood. Right? I think fathers are generally under-appreciated. Who would agree with me, right? [men clap, cheer] Listen to these divorced dads! Right? Obviously, the mom is the hero of the story, right? [women clap, cheer] When someone becomes famous, they buy their mom a house. They don’t even invite the dad to live there. [laughter] Often, it’s easier to understand a mother’s contribution. I see it in my family. My children see, on a daily basis, what my wife does for them. Yet, when I travel the country, eating steak and complaining about my kids… [laughter] Do I get credit? I sure don’t. Being a dad is like being a backup quarterback in the NFL. You’re on the team, but you’re not the star. And on those rare occasions you’re brought into the game, people are nervous, you know? [laughter] [applause] Oh, thank you. [cheering] It’s amazing how the status of father has changed in our society. You know, in the 1950s, there was a television show called Father Knows Best. Father Knows Best. And they… and they weren’t being ironic. They weren’t like, [condescending] “Wouldn’t it be hysterical if a dad knew anything?” [laughter] [normal] They were sincere ’cause at that time, the prevailing belief was that a father did know best. Not only would they never do that show today, if you gave someone the prompt, “Father knows,” no one would say, “best.” [laughter] If you’re like, “Father knows…” “Uh, how to make an old fashioned? I don’t know.” [laughter] Even if you went up to a dad, you’re like, “Father knows…” “Uh, when to say… I d… I don’t know, ask my wife. “What the hell do you want me to say? I’m not yelling! You’re yelling!” [laughter] “You want an old fashioned? Alright, I’ll make you an old fashioned.” [grunting] I’m lucky. My wife, my starting quarterback, is amazing. Uh, we’ve been married for 20 years. Can you believe that? Twenty years. [applause, cheering] Twenty years. And, uh, we have a great marriage, from what you know. [laughter] ‘Cause you never really know what’s going on in someone else’s marriage, right? You might think you do, but you… When you hear about a divorce, you’re always surprised. Sometimes, you realize it was all an act, right? Like, there, there should be awards. “The nominees for best performance in an unhappy marriage are…” [laughter] “Oh, she was good. She was very good. I had no idea she despised him.” No, my wife is amazing, or her performance is amazing. [laughter] No, my wife… And she does everything. And she’s done that since the start of our marriage. She planned our whole wedding. She’s very Catholic, so she picked out every reading in, in the whole service. And I remember watching my brother-in-law read 1 Corinthians. If you don’t know, that’s the, [whiny] “Love is patient.” Love is kind. Love is… [gibberish].” [normal] That’s how it sounded to me. [audience laughing] But, I remember it so vividly because it ends with, “Love doesn’t keep a record.” And I tell you, after 20 years of marriage, my wife has done one thing. Keep a record… [laughter, applause] Of every mistake I’ve ever made. She has receipts going back to our first date. She brings up stuff before we even met. [nasal] “I remember seeing you in the neighborhood. You looked so arrogant.” [laughter] [normal] She remembers everything! I can’t tell you what happened a half hour ago. It’s not fair. [laughs] I’ll be like, “Hey, I thought we agreed.” “What did I say exactly?” [audience laughing] “You win.” Her memory is so good. I’m convinced she heard a different 1 Corinthians. “Love does keep a record. Love is slightly annoyed. “Love doesn’t appreciate you coming back from being out of town [inhales] And second-guessing decisions I’ve made. It undermines me. Amen.” [laughter] [applause, cheering] She’s pretty amazing. I have no complaints. Well, if there was one complaint… [laughter] Not a complaint, an observation. My wife’s not a fan of our dog. Well, she’s indifferent to our dog. But, you know, to a dog lover, people that are indifferent to dogs seem like sociopaths. [laughing, applause] It’s like, “You don’t love dogs? Who hurt you?” There’s no excuse to not love dogs! I mean, my wife’s allergic. That’s one excuse. [laughter] But our dog is so sweet and will not leave my wife alone. Whenever my wife enters the room, the dog climbs all over her, sneezing. And as my wife pushes the dog away, so that she can breathe, there’s always part of me that thinks, “Hey, don’t be mean to my dog.” [laughter] Now, you may be wondering, “If your wife’s allergic, “why do you even have a dog? Did you get the dog, and then discover your wife’s allergic?” No. [laughter] I’ve known my wife’s allergic for 20 years, and I never expected us to get a dog. I never did. I mean, we live in an apartment in New York City. We have five children. I travel constantly. We’re not getting a dog. But then, the pandemic happened, and all the reasons to not get a dog seemed to disappear. We rented a house in the suburbs with a big yard. I stopped traveling. My wife’s allergies didn’t change. [audience laughing] Mainly, my kids started begging for a dog. “Can we get a dog? Can we get a dog?” It was like on a daily basis. So, I told my wife, I’m like, “Let me handle this.” So, I called a family meeting, and I stood next to my wife, and I said, “Once and for all”, “your mother is allergic to dogs. When she’s around dogs, she feels physically ill.” And my youngest, he’s so sweet. He was like, [high voice] “Can’t Mom just get a shot in her stomach?” [laughter] He reminds me of myself. So, I turned to my wife, and I was like, “Can’t you just get a shot in your stomach?” She was like, “What the hell are you doing?” I was like, “I don’t know why you’re mad at me. He’s the one who asked.” [audience laughing] [Jim laughs] She didn’t think it was funny. And I could see that we weren’t getting anywhere, so I proposed a compromise. I was like, “What if we fostered a dog?” “The dog would only live with us until a permanent home was found, or… my wife died.” [audience laughing] She really didn’t think that was funny and left the room. But, the next day, outta nowhere, she was like, “Alright, fine, we can foster a dog, but we’re not keeping it.” And I was like, “We’re not keeping it.” So I went and I got this dog, and I brought it home. And the most incredible thing happened. Not only did my children fall in love with this dog, but slowly, over time, and being occasionally exposed to the dog, my wife’s allergies… didn’t change. [audience laughing] But, she witnessed how much my children loved the dog. So, she decided we could keep the dog. She made that sacrifice for my family, and it made me realize I don’t get enough credit. [audience laughing] I don’t bring this up a lot, but I think I’m allergic to children. [laughter] And we got five of those. You know, we only got one dog, and it’s not a competition, but I win. [laughter] After we had the dog for like a month, my wife was feeling sluggish. We thought she had COVID. She kept testing negative. So, she, she went to the doctor, and they took a blood test, and they discovered she had contracted Lyme disease. [audience gasps] Which is something you get from a tick, which is something that dogs foster. [laughter] She told me this over the phone, and I was like, “Oh, she’s gonna kill me.” [laughter] She is. She’s gonna kill me, and she has every right to kill me.” And I just braced myself as she drove home. But, when she got in the house, she very calmly walked up to me, and she goes, “Well I have Lyme disease because of that dog. What do you have to say for yourself?” And I said the only thing I could say, I was like, “Well, you’re the one who wanted the dog.” [audience laughing] [applause] And she said… She said, “Don’t gaslight me.” And I was like, “I’ve never heard that term before.” [laughter] She was like, “You’ve never heard of gaslighting?” And I was like, “I don’t think anyone on this planet has heard of gaslighting. You might be going crazy.” [audience laughing] Now, I’m sensing some tension in the room. [laughs] What you have to understand is that the Lyme disease is gone. She’s fine. And by the way, also, my wife is the strongest person I’ve ever met. Those five children, she gave birth to each of those children in our apartment. No drugs. She had Lyme disease. It’s gone. She’s fine. Before that, she had a brain tumor. It’s gone. She’s fine. And I asked her at one point, I go, “What’s been the biggest challenge you’ve encountered?” And she said, “Being married to you.” [laughter, applause] [cheering] And I have to tell you, I take pride in that. [laughter] Alright, you guys have been a delight. Thank you very much.

              " 'hasan': [\"[dramatic rap music playing] [audience cheering and applauding] San Jose, what’s up? [audience cheering and applauding] Nice to see you! What’s happening? What’s going on, Bay Area? Listen to me, tonight, tonight’s gonna be special, San Jose. [music ends] You know what I love when I look out here? I love the diversity I see here. [audience laughs and cheers] Not racially. Financially. [audience laughs] [Hasan chuckles jokingly] The good stuff. The stuff that matters. The stuff that’s real. The money, all right? There’s money in this room. But there’s also not money in this room. [audience laughs] That’s the Bay. You’re not as progressive as you think you are, Bay Area. In this room right now, there’s a guy who owns three homes. And he’s sitting directly next to a dude who only owns three hoodies. [audience laughs] And one of y’all’s getting stabbed tonight. It’s probably the landlord. [laughs] [audience laughs] Because it’s all here. I can see it. It’s all here. Whoo-hoo. We got it all here. We got the one percent, right? We got, like, Palo Alto, Los Altos. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? Stanford area, right? Yeah, the one percent. Yeah! Yes. You definitely drive a Tesla. I can see it. [audience laughs] Yeah, the one percent right here, eh? Then way the fuck back there, we have the 99% just… [audience cheering] Hayward, Richmond, East Oakland. Yeah! Yeah, this is your landlord! Kill him! Kill him! Why does he keep raising the rent? [laughs] This is why I had to do it in the Bay. Even when you’re rich in the Bay, you’re poor. [audience laughs] You could be a Google engineer making 900 grand a year, and you have to live in a trap house in East Oakland, and you’re on OnlyFans making them cheeks clap just so you can pay rent. Just so you can pay this uncle rent. Dude, we have Zillow.com, and we’re still a functioning society. How? Do you know what Zillow.com is? Zillow.com is a website where you can type in the address of someone you’re jealous of… [audience laughs] and you can see their mortgage payment. [audience laughs] Dude, we’re never gonna own. Millennials, Gen Z, y’all are never, never gonna own homes. And it’s our fault. [woman] Yup. We fumbled the bag. Because for years we were praying to God. “God, please fix the housing crisis.” “Please open up the supply of available homes in this country.” And then, in March of 2020, God was like, “Here.” [audience laughs] “Here’s a disease that specifically kills old people.” [audience laughs] And we were like, “No!” “Wear a mask!” “Save Grandma!” “Stop the spread!” Let it spread. [audience laughs] Let God cook. [audience laughing and cheering] Yeah, we’re idiots, Californians. We’re fucking idiots. Look at all the states that were anti-mask. Plenty of homes. [audience laughs] Nevada, Georgia, Florida. Plenty of homes. Plenty of dead grandmas. These people accept God’s blessings. [audience laughs] All I’m saying is if you were pro-mask, you cannot complain about housing prices. What do you want? You wanna save Grandma or you want a backyard? You can’t have both. [audience laughs] Dude, the same problem with the housing market, these fucking Boomers will not die, is the same problem with the US government. These fucking Boomers will not die. [audience cheers] Our entire government is just a mass nursing home-dot-gov. I mean, it’s fucking… Uncle, why are you clapping? That’s you. You’re like, “Yeah!” What? Even he’s like, “They’re too old, man!” [audience laughs] This is gonna come out right before the election. People are arguing about the president. Fucking zoom out. Look at Congress. There’s 535 members of Congress, and they’re all old as fuck. Dude, Nancy Pelosi is 84 years old. [audience murmuring] Is anyone here 84 years old? [audience laughs] Yeah, of course not! Yes, it’s 7:00 p.m. Of course not! It’s seven o’clock. You’re asleep. Of course you’re not here. Why would you be here? Why the fuck would you be here? People are like, “Oh, Hasan, you’re really ageist.” “That really age…” Yeah, I am capital-A ageist. [audience laughs] Write about it. Substack it. Make it the headline. “I am age…” Age matters. Ask Drake. [audience exclaims] It is a pertinent detail. Hey! Hey! Hey! I thought we were the science people. Progressives, “Trust the science.” “Believe the science. Don’t let your kids on social media.” “The synapses in their brain…” “The synapses in their brain are still develo…” “The synapses.” Senator Chuck Grassley is 90 years old. [audience laughs] What do you think the synapse…? What… [audience cheering] He has the MRI brain scan of an NFL quarterback. It’s fucking applesauce up there. Why don’t we treat our politicians the same way we treat our professional athletes? Here in America, the moment you lose just a little bit of edge as an athlete, we fucking turn on you. [audience laughs] Within two years. Even the GOATs, right? Michael Jordan with the Wizards. Kobe with the Achilles. Look at the way that we treated Tom Brady. The moment Tom Brady couldn’t give us an eighth Super Bowl, we were like, “Brady, you got two more years.” This motherfucker lost to the Rams, right? “One more year, Brady.” Then this motherfucker lost to the Cowboys. “Bring this old geezer to the back of the shed.” “Let’s put two bullets into his skull.” “Let’s tear apart his marriage. Let’s ridicule his children.” “Let’s roast his ass on Netflix in 190 countries and just piss all over his legacy.” Just, “Tudum!” [audience whooping] [laughs] Now look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [audience exclaims] Eighty-seven years old! Ruth Bader Ginsburg battled cancer, five times in the last 20 years of her life. And Barack Obama was like, “Please, Ruth, for the love of God, retire so I can replace you.” And this geriatric coffin-dodger was like, “Fuck you, Barry.” [audience laughs] “I’ll see you in fucking hell.” [audience laughs] And every progressive was like, “Yas, queen!” “Notorious RBG.” If we treated Ruth Bader Ginsburg the same way we treated Tom Brady, abortion would still be legal in all 50 states. [audience cheering and whooping] You know what’s interesting? Depending on where I do that joke, the audience reacts very differently. Sometimes when I do that joke, Trump fans get mad at me. Sometimes Biden fans get mad at me. But here’s my thing. Why are you a fan? [audience laughs] You know? Like, you’re like a fan of a president. You have like a T-shirt. You have like a poster on the wall. Like, “This is my guy!” “He’s my…” Like, being a fan of a politician is like being a fan of a national bank. [audience laughs] Imagine walking through downtown San Jose and seeing some loser with a T-shirt. Just like, “Citibank!” You see another guy, “No, fuck you, bro! Wells Fargo!” [audience laughs] “Do you wanna be on the right side of history?” It’s like, dude, I’ve banked with both. They will disappoint you for different reasons. Because I’ve met these people. I’ve met all of them. I’m part of the Illuminati. [audience laughs] They all reach out to me during election season. They think I’m the brown whisperer. [audience laughs] They think if we have lunch, I’ll blow the conch. Know what I mean? I’ll be like… [imitates blowing conch shell] “Browns… we must vote for Andrew Yang!” [audience laughs and applauds] No, why are you clap… No, don’t clap! They’re all fucking insane. I am 38 years old. This will be the tenth presidential cycle of my lifetime. Every president in my lifetime goes into office a sociopath and then leaves a war criminal. [whoops] Because they all want one thing. You know what they want? They want the ring. Ooh, they want the ring of power. They want it. They want it more than marriage, more than family. More than their kids. Look at Hillary Clinton. Look at how bad Hillary Clinton wanted to be president. Hillary Clinton wanted to be president so bad, she was willing to sit in the same office… [audience exclaiming] Not a different office. Not a replica House of Cards office. The Oval Office. That is sociopathic ambition. That’s why there’s so many Indians in politics. [audience laughs] Bro, we got sociopathic ambition. In one generation, look how many Indians there are in politics, running the highest offices around the world. One generation. Rishi Sunak. Nikki Haley. Vivek Ramaswamy. Half of Kamala Harris when she wants our vote. We are fucking killing it! [audience cheering] [Hasan laughs] Dude… Look at the Republican Party. There are more Indians in the Republican Party than my bachelor party. [audience laughs] And right now it’s wild. Y’all, more minorities with melanin, ooh, joining the hard-R Republicans. It’s happening more than ever. And all my white NPR tote-bag friends, it fries their brain. They’re like, “What the fuck is going on?” “Why are all these Mexicans voting for Donald Trump?” [audience laughs] “He calls them rapists!” I’m like, “Chelsea… do you know what I would let a politician call me if I could pay zero percent federal income tax?” [audience laughs] “I would let you body-cavity search me at every airport.” “Spit in my mouth and call me a terrorist.” [imitates spitting] Daddy wants to pay zero-percent FICA. That’s the thing Caucasia will never understand about Beige-istan. We are way more practical than we are progressive. [audience laughing and cheering] Sir, what’s your name? Nicholas. Nicholas. Great, perfect. [audience laughs] [laughs] You’re clapping at “Beige…” Do you know what Beige-istan is? Sort of. Okay. You’re like, “Sort of”? Gentlemen, let me bring you into this as well. My good sir, what’s your name? Vlad. Vlad. Perfect. And…? Ian. …Ian. Okay. So there’s… There’s white America. There’s Black America. Then there’s Beige-istan. [audience laughs] And, I mean, that’s just everybody. Indians, Latinos, Filipinos, wherever the fuck Bruno Mars is from. Beige-istan. Right? Okay? Listen, Beige-istan, we got four issues. Politicians, they pander to us. We just got four issues. You do these four, we’ll vote for you. Send this to the governor. These are the four issues. Number one. Give me a green card. [audience laughing and cheering] [laughs] You see that? Everyone, “I’ll suck your dick! Give me that green card!” “Give me an H-1B!” Number two. Believe in God. Preferably one of the religions that makes you feel bad after you masturbate. [audience laughs] Those are the real ones. Number three. I told you, I don’t like paying taxes. [audience laughs] Number four. Don’t bomb my home country. [audience cheering and whooping] But if you give me number one… I’ll let you do number four. [Hasan laughs maniacally] The way you leaned into him, you know what I’m talking about! You know the Beige guilt. We feel so much Beige guilt. Oh! We talk about white guilt all the time. You know what you did. God knows what you did, right? Black people, you have no guilt. That’s why you guys can dance, right? You didn’t hurt anybody. Like, “Look at the rhythm.” He can’t dance. Like, “Slavery!” Fuck, right? It’s too much. It’s too much. But Beige guilt’s different. Beige guilt, we’re immigrants. We’re immigrants by choice. We know the world is like Star Wars. You have the Empire ran by Lord Vader, that’s America. [audience laughs] The Empire has all the money, the weapons, the military bases all over the galaxy. And for the past half-century, the Empire has been bombing the shit out of the Rebellion. That’s Beige-istan. Cambodia, Korea, Vietnam, Japan. [scats “The Imperial March Darth Vader’s Theme”] [imitates explosion then screams] Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza. [scats “The Imperial March Darth Vader’s Theme”] [imitates explosion then screams] Then in 1982, my dad got a green card to go live in the Empire. And for the past 40 years, we’ve been funding the destruction of Tatooine. And we did all that… for a white BMW 3 Series. [audience laughing and whooping] Which ironically looks like a Stormtrooper. [audience laughs] I’m joking, by the way. I don’t own a white BMW 3 Series. I lease… [audience laughs] …a 2023 Kia Carnival. I lease it. So if you wanna fact-check me, I just wanna let you know, I lease a 2023 Kia Carnival, $431 a month. We leased it from Columbia Kia. We got it at the Summer Kia Sales Event. You can get a brand-new Kia Sorento or Kia Carnival for zero down, zero APR financing. The Kia Summer Sales Event starts now. Kia, movement that inspires. I have to do this now, you guys. I have to be factually accurate. Because I don’t know if you saw this last year. The New Yorker fact-checked my stand-up comedy. [audience whooping] [laughs] Yeah. They were just like, “Ah! Ho-ho-ho! Breaking news. Magicians aren’t wizards.” And now, now I have a “controversies” tab on my Wikipedia. [audience laughing and applauding] No! Why are you… No! Don’t clap! What are you doing? Why are you clapping? What the fuck is wrong… It’s a dorky controversy. What is wrong with you guys? It’s not even a good one. I didn’t fuck a porn star. [audience laughs] I didn’t diddle a boy. [audience laughs] I got caught embellishing for dramatic effect. [audience laughs] Same crime your aunt is guilty of over Thanksgiving. [audience laughs] [audience cheering and whooping] You know what’s wild? This is the greatest irony. The greatest irony of all of this is that if you want to call me out for being a liar, you don’t have to fact-check my stand-up comedy. I’m a heterosexual man. [audience laughs] I lie all the time. [audience laughs] I let that shit fly like Steph. Like, I’m just like, “Lie.” Oh! Lie. Like, let it fly. Over dumb shit. Stupid… I’ll be at CVS checking out. Just… [imitating scanner beeping] Like, “Oh, my God. Hey!” “Um, do you wanna donate to the American Diabetes Association?” I’ll be like, “Oh, yeah, maybe later.” I’m never donating. [audience laughs] And both my parents have diabetes. [audience exclaiming and laughing] [Hasan laughs] Yes! You can’t guilt… No, don’t you fucking judge me. I have already donated to the Minhaj Diabetes Association. I bought my dad a fucking Peloton. He never uses it. [audience laughs] He only uses it to hang his wet towels. He’s like, “Oh, look at that. Wow.” “Look at how fast it dries, Hasan. Wow! Why aren’t you donating?” I’m like, “Why aren’t you pedaling?” Let’s start with the problem and not the symptom. I’m never donating. And I’m definitely getting diabetes. That’s the crazy part. And I should care. I’m almost 40 years old. I can feel it. The midlife crisis has hit. There’s a lot of guys my age, around this age. I can feel it in the room. Every guy my age is trying to get rich or ripped as quickly as possible. [audience laughs] Just software engineers out here biohacking. Fucking cold-plunging. Fucking doing Brazilian jujitsu. Fucking doing this shit. [audience laughs] Fucking flipping tires. Idiots. Idiots. Fucking pharmacist hard pivoting into financial experts. Getting into crypto. Idiots. Every woman in my life, y’all could not be bothered by crypto fucking currency. You’re just like, “Nah.” “I know what this is.” “I had an aunt that sold Avon. This is some bullshit.” [audience cheering] “This is Herbalife for men.” Go back upstairs and keep playing fantasy football, you fucking idiot. [audience laughs] How old are you, my man? 17. 17? So you were looking into crypto for sure. [laughs] You know what it is? I’m part of a generation of men that don’t read, but listen to podcasts. [audience laughs] Terrifying. All my homeys out here texting me alpha-male memes, just… “Hard times make hard men.” “Hard men make good times.” “Good times make soft men.” “A society will never value its men until the wolves are at the door.” I’m like, “Sanjay, you’re a software engineer.” “Shut the fuck up.” Why… [audience cheering and whooping] Why are you texting me like you’re Julius Caesar? “Whatever, bro.” “Mamba mentality.” Mamba mentality! Sanjay, you blew your knee out playing pickleball and you’re quoting Kobe Bryant. If Kobe knew you were quoting him, he’d put you in a helicopter and crash that shit himself. [audience exclaiming] [man coughing] You okay, bro? Don’t die. You all right? [audience laughs] [laughs] It wasn’t… How old are you, bro? I’m 19. You’re 19. Big chain poppin’! Ooh! [laughs] [Hasan laughs] There’s a lot of chains on right now. Just a lot of, “Ooh.” A lot of just Desi Drake energy here tonight. The way y’all are lined up is fucking Algebra 2 Trig, just like, ta-ta! Ninety-degree angle just fucking make it. Make it perpendicular. Ladies, you wanna know why all these guys secretly listen to Jordan Peterson? [woman 1] Why? [woman 2] Why? I’ll tell you why. I’ll tell you. We’re scared. We’re so afraid that the best is behind us. The best hairline. [audience laughs] The best body. The best dick. [audience laughs] Back there. You’re 17, right? [scoffs] I remember 17, man. How old are you? [man] I’m 39. You’re 39? Remember when you were 17? Remember when your shit was just like, pow! Remember when it was just… [yells] Right? It was like the Bruce Lee one-inch punch. You’re just like… [yells] [audience laughs] You remember that shit, man? When I’d be at a urinal, it was just… Tsst! Tsst! Tsst! It was like a laser. It was just like fucking SEAL Team Six taking out Osama bin Laden. Just, “Got him!” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, “Clear! Got him!” Right? And now, 38, my shit is just… Whoo. It’s just… Pew! It’s just like an Israeli drone strike. Just… Oh fuck, it’s a school. Oh fuck, it’s a church. Oh, fuck, it’s a refugee camp. I didn’t mean for it to go there. [audience laughs] [Hasan laughs] Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! [laughs] That really divided the room. You know, it’s interesting. That’s every issue in America now. Everything is binary now. War, the economy, politics, it’s just two sides. It’s not what the media’s telling you. It’s not rich versus poor. It’s not Black versus white. It’s not Democrats versus Republicans. It’s insane people and insufferable people. [audience laughs] That’s it! All right? [audience cheering and whooping] [Hasan laughs] You know the insane people. You know them. You went to high school with them. They’re still on Facebook. They have a gun in their Facebook profile photo. You’re like, “Whoa, Travis.” “What up?” “Where were you January 6th?” [audience laughs] They’re nuts. They’re nuts. But Travis is fun. [audience laughs] Then there’s the insufferable people. [sighs] [clicks tongue] A lot of them are here tonight. [audience laughs] Just these dorky-ass, teacher’s pet, hall monitors. Just, “No, no, no, no, no!” “No, but actually.” “No, but tech…” These vitamin D-deficient, mouth-breathing, insufferable lo… “You said this, but it’s actually this. You wrote this, but…” “Did you see my Slack? I pinged you.” These insufferable losers that pick pointless fights. The type of insufferable losers that will go on a daytime talk show like Ellen and get mad at Ellen DeGeneres for mispronouncing their name. I mean, what type of insufferable fucking loser would do such a thing? [audience cheering and whooping] Yeah, that was me. I was that person. Yes, that’s a rhetorical question. Yes, you were 13 when this happened. Years ago, I went on Ellen’s talk show and I go, “Hey, Ellen.” “Hey, Ellen DeGeneres.” “My name isn’t Hasan Minhaj.” “It’s Hasan Minhaj.” “Say it right.” “This is the name of my ancestors.” Of course she couldn’t say it right. Because she’s Ellen. [audience laughs] She’s a 65-year-old white billionaire who lives in Montecito. She can’t speak Urdu. [audience laughs] She’s Ellen, she’s not a Sufi poet. [audience laughs] And ever since I fought this pointless fight, people say my name worse. [audience laughs] People run up to me in the street and they shout the wrong name at me with vigor. [audience laughs] Like they’re trying to score points on Duolingo. [audience laughs] They’re just like, “Hussein!” [audience laughing] “Hummus!” “Hamas!” Ding, ding, ding! “Yes! Yes! Yes!” “I knew his name was Hamas!” “Five letters. Starts with an H.” “He looks like a Hamas.” [audience laughs] “Take me to the tunnels.” I’m like, “I don’t know where they are.” Oh, no. Ian! My life is perfect and I’m out here arguing with Ellen over vowels. Why did I do that? Why did I… Why wasn’t… [muttering] Why did I do that? I was so insufferable. I used to make fun of my Chinese friends for having two names. Yeah. I used to make fun of Ronny Chieng for being an Asian sellout. [audience laughs] Wait, you think Ronny Chieng’s real name is Ronny Chieng? [audience laughs] Look at his face. Look at his Chinese-Malay… No! His real name is Xin Yi Chieng. But he knows if he meets Ian… Ian will be like, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, streaming now on Disney Plus.” So instead… [audience cheering and whooping] …he goes, “Hi!” “I’m Ronald McDonald.” “Nice to meet you.” “Here to bring shareholder value to the company.” “Call me Ron-Ron.” [audience laughs] Because Chinese people are smart. They know you have to have a Chinese name, and then Americans-are-dumb-as-fuck name. [audience laughs] But I was the problem. “No…” [muttering] “It’s the point!” And it bit me in the ass. I remember I used to close my set with this joke. In New York City it would be my closer. I’d be like, “Ronny Chieng is an Asian sellout, good night!” I’m leaving the club. And this woman in the audience gets up and chases me into the street. She was like, “Excuse me.” “Oh, ho-ho! I could be a normal person, but I have a point to prove.” [audience laughs] And I’m not gonna say her ethnicity… [audience laughs] [audience laughs] …but her name was Ashley. [audience laughs] E-I-G-H. Just… [audience exclaims] [yells] “Excuse me. Can I see the manager?” “Hi! Hello. Hi.” “Hey stop.” “Hello.” “Hmph.” [audience laughs] “I saw your skit back there.” “And I have to say, ‘really?'” “Really?” “Making fun of Asian names.” “These are the jokes we’re making with our platform?” [audience laughs] “Um, Hagh-hen…” “India is a part of Asia.” “Do better.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Ash-league… [audience laughs] …no the fuck it’s not.” “There’s Indians and there’s Asians.” [audience laughing and whooping] “And we don’t fuck with each other.” [audience laughs] “In fact, Ashley-egg… you can’t stop Asian hate because Asians all hate…” [woman] Each other! “…each other,” thank you! “Furthermore, Ashleg-ha… here’s a dirty little secret.” “White people… [scoffs] …you’re not even the best at racism.” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] Wait, no, don’t get me wrong, they had a lot of hits. They had some bangers, right? Slavery, Jim Crow. Just, mwah, classics. But… But… some new teams have emerged to compete for the title. [audience laughs] See, now this is important. Fact-check me here. See, when white people are racist, they’re racist against people that don’t look like them. [audience laughs] Which is wrong. But it kind of makes sense. Asian people? [audience laughs] We hate people who look exactly fucking like us. [audience cheering and whooping] In fact… if you touch countries with us… [laughs maniacally] …we hate you even more! It’s fucking crazy. Look at us, right? Hindustanis, Indians. Who do we shit on? [man] Pakistanis! Pakistanis, right? Pakistanis. You shit on Bengalis. Bengalis, you shit on Sri Lankans. Sri Lankans shit on Nepalese people. That’s just the hairy Asians. [audience laughs] Let’s talk about the hairless Asians, shall we? They’re here. Let’s talk about them. Let’s air it out. Let’s say what we can’t say at the DEI meeting. Let’s just get it out, right? Right? Chinese people. Yes! You shit on Koreans, right? Koreans shit on Japanese people. Japanese people shit back on Koreans. Both of those people shit on Chinese people. Meanwhile, Taiwan and Tibet, they’re like, “Hey!” “What about us?” And China’s like, “Shut the fuck up.” “You don’t even exist.” [laughs] Oh. Oh. You think Fox News dads are the problem? You think Ian’s dad is the problem? [laughs] Really? Try talking race relations with an Indian or Chinese father. Try asking this Indian uncle what he thinks of Black people. Oh, fuck! Oh, ho-ho! Oh! [audience exclaiming] Enter the 36 chambers of fucking insanity. Try… [laughs] He’ll be like, “The phones are locked, right?” It’ll be fucking crazy. Try explaining George Floyd to an Indian dad. Oh, I did. Oh, we all did. June, 2020. I’m upstairs in Sacramento, in my childhood bedroom. My dad runs into my bedroom panting. “Oh my God, Hasan, are you watching the news?” “Why is Target on fire?” [audience laughs] This was his line. Target is ablaze. The civil war has begun. Where will I get my towels to hang over my Peloton? [audience cheering and whooping] And I was like, “Dad, stop it.” This is an important moment in our nation’s history. For the first time in 40 years, Beige-istan has been asked to pick a team. [audience laughs] And we have to pick a team tonight. My dad’s like, “What are the teams?” [audience laughs] I’m like, “All right, Dad, sit down.” This is important. Let me just explain this to you. [sighs] All right, Dad, there’s two teams. All right? So there’s Black Lives Matter. All right? Black people are saying, “Hey, treat us like human beings.” Then there’s All Lives Matter. And they’re like, “Hey.” “No!” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] Those are the teams. Which team do you wanna pick? And he’s like, “Hasan, both of these people are idiots.” No one matters. [audience laughing and whooping] What? “What’s your GPA? I’ll tell you if you matter.” I mean, this dude is fucking Thanos. I go, “Dad, never say this in public. Don’t go to work and say this.” “We live in America.” “This is a multiracial democracy, Dad, all right?” “We’re trying to unspool the vestiges of white supremacy.” He’s like, “Hasan, white supremacy isn’t real.” “Don’t let them colonize your mind, man.” [audience laughs] “Come to my office.” You know, every dad has an office. It’s just some room in the house with dusty filing cabinets and a Windows 95 CD-ROM drive. He goes, “Hey, come sit before my Compaq Presario that I’ve had for the past 28 years.” “Sit here. I have to teach you a lesson.” My dad, on his computer, has pulled up a PDF of the US census. It is queued up to income by ethnicity. He’s like, “Read it.” [speaks in Urdu] Okay. These are the highest earners by ethnicity. Number one. Indian Americans. [audience cheering] Average dual, median income, $120,000 per year. [man] Wow. I know, that’s nothing in the Bay. [audience laughs] [laughs] I heard a guy, “Wow.” Number two. Distant second. [audience laughs] Whites. Parentheses, non-Hispanics. [audience laughs] Racist. Yo, the US government is so racist. They’re like, “None of you light-skinned, Bad Bunny-looking Latinos.” “None of you Ricky Martin, Pau Gasol-looking Latins.” “We want purebred, Viking, Mayflower white.” Average dual, median income, $76,000 per year. My dad goes, “Hasan, you see that?” [audience laughs] “Ha. Even on their best day, the white man is three-fifths of an Indian.” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] I know. Yo! Bars, Dad. Fucking bars. Up top, Pops. Up top. He’s like, “Now look how much Jews make.” I’m like, “No, no, no. I’m not doing that.” “Come on, man. It’s for research.” I go, “That sounds worse.” Don’t say it’s for research. But that’s my dad. He’s Mufasa, I’m Simba. He lives within me. [audience laughs] And now I have a four-year-old son. I can’t teach him that. [laughs] I can’t be like, “Hey, son, no one matters.” Mwah! “Go live your life.” [audience laughs] “Life is nothing but an elephant graveyard.” I can’t do that. I remember I was back home in Sacramento. I was visiting my parents because they have diabetes. [audience laughs] This is a powerful moment in my life. Because I have two children now. I have my kids and I have my parents. [audience laughs] I’m sitting in between. We’re sitting on the couch. Seventy-four-year-old dad. Four-year-old son. I’m in the middle. And they’re both just screaming into their iPads. [audience laughs] They’re like, “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” Right? I’m like, “I’m here, don’t you cry.” “Don’t you cry.” [speaks in Urdu] “Don’t you cry. I’m here.” I’m the halftime show. I have to figure out, what am I taking from this old man and passing on to my son? What is some shit I got to delete? [audience laughs] That’s our biggest challenge, right? How do we break generational trauma? We have to figure out, what’s an heirloom that we take from our past and pass on? And what is some baggage we gotta leave at Goodwill? [audience laughs] Because our parents, they fucked us up. They gave us a lot of baggage. But at the same time, there’s a lot of beautiful heirlooms that our parents gave us in Beige-istan that we took for granted. Uncle, we took this for granted. Here’s something you gave your children that they took for granted. No matter how bad you fuck up in Beige-istan, tax evasion, fraud, stand-up comedy… [audience laughs] …you can always go home. In fact… [audience cheering and whooping] …our parents’ greatest dream would be if we never left home. I’m almost 40 years old. I have a wife, I have two kids. My mom’s greatest dream would be if I moved back upstairs to my childhood bedroom. Just quietly having an orgasm underneath the Scottie Pippen poster, just… Just, “Oh, babe, keep it down.” “Sweetheart, my mom’s downstairs. Just be quiet.” My mom would be thrilled. “Wow, my son is climaxing under Toy Story sheets.” “This is what I always wanted.” “Our khandan is together.” She would come in with sliced fruit, just… “Kids, do you want apples?” I’d be like, “Mom!” [audience laughs] “I told you, I like peanut butter!” [audience laughs] “Bring me peanut butter!” But Ritz-cracker Americans? Purebred capital-A Americans? No, no, no, no, no. Zero to eighteen, you get to live at home. The day you turn 18… I’ve been to the graduation party. Dad gets on the mic. “Travis!” “Ha, ha. Happy graduation, bud.” “Get the fuck out of my house!” [audience whooping] “The next time you walk through that door, you better PayPal me, bitch.” I mean, this… [audience laughs] This is why there’s so many homeless people in America. None of these people can go home. [audience laughs] Oh, are you getting uptight? You getting uptight? Really? Really? Let me ask you a question, San Jose. Have you ever seen an Indian homeless person in America? [audience cheering and whooping] Huh? No. Hey, I’ll bet you a Kia Carnival. [audience laughs] Let’s go to the worst part of the Bay… Let’s go to the Tenderloin tonight, all right? Just imagine seeing a 5’7″ bespeckled Indian man. Cardboard cutout, “Hungry, homeless.” “I need help.” You’d be like, “Rajif?” [audience laughs] “Go home.” [audience laughs] “Come home. Live… What are you doing? Get in the car.” [audience laughs] [laughs] Okay, to be fair. To be fair… There are a lot of Indian homeless people in India. [audience laughs] There’s like a lot. They’ve won the Oscar, they made documentaries, it’s crazy. [laughs] Where’s your family from originally? Bangalore. Bangalore? Ever been back? Yeah. You remember when you go back to the motherland, back to Beige-istan, and you’re sitting in the rickshaw with your mom the first time. Right? 17, you’re young. They walk up… Yeah, then the kid with one arm walks up to the… Starts banging on the window with the stub, just… “Madam! Madam!” “Please, madam, please!” [speaks in Urdu] “Give me one rupee, please.” Then your mom, she’s a piece of shit. She goes, “Don’t look at them!” “Don’t you look at them. They’ll steal your soul!” “Don’t look at them!” And she goes, “I’m sorry!” “I’m sorry, I don’t have any money. I have to buy jewelry.” [audience laughs] “I have to buy bangles. Do you understand?” “See, bangles, they go on your arms.” “But you don’t have any arms, so you wouldn’t understand.” [audience laughs] “And me getting bangles is more important than you eating.” Am I lying? Am I lying? Go into any Desi woman’s closet. That shit is like the cave scene from Aladdin, just… “Touch nothing but the lamp.” I mean, auntie, look at you. Just fucking bedazzled. You just robbed pirates. Look, just… Ah! Just fucking rapper bling. [audience laughs] You know all those kids, right? [boy] Huh? You know, when you sit in the rickshaw. And all those kids surround your car like The Walking Dead? [hisses] Right? [audience laughs] They’re all related. They’re all family. That’s what I want for my kids. [audience laughs] I’m not giving them shit. I want them to beg as a family. [audience laughs] But they can live with me. That I will allow. Mi casa, su casa. Come and go as you please. No boundaries. We don’t believe in boundaries. [audience laughs] [laughs] Okay, let me ask you a question. Watch me hit this… This is a Tim Duncan bank shot. Watch me land this joke perfect. Okay? I’m 38. He’s 17, right? What’s your name? Sunaad. What’s that? Sunaad. Sunaad? Watch this. Sunaad, growing up, could you close your bedroom door and then lock the bedroom? Of course not! This is what I’m talking about! No! If I… [audience cheering and whooping] If I locked my bedroom door, that shit would turn into The Shining within sec… “Hey! Hey! Hey!” “Are you watching pornography?” And it’s like… [audience laughs] [audience whooping] I am. [audience laughs] But it’s none of your business. “Never lock the door!” Why? Why? Uncle, why? What’s the logic? Why? Why can’t we… It doesn’t make sense! “Never lock the door.” I tried to explain this to my… “Dad, what if I have to go to the bathroom and take a dump?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “Then close the door.” “But don’t lock it.” [audience laughs] “I might have to take a shower.” [audience laughing and whooping] You laugh. No, no, no, you laugh. That’s how much my dad loves me. He’s willing to take a hot shower in my shit fumes. [audience laughs] Just… [singing in Urdu] [imitates farting] That is love. [audience laughs] You wish your dad knew your scent, Ian. But no. No, no, no. In Caucasia, you love your boundaries. “Boundaries!” “Hey, Mom? Boundaries!” “Mom? Hey, bitch, these are my boundaries, you bitch.” “I know I ripped through your vagina to your taint, but these are my boundaries, you bitch.” Not only are you obsessed with emotional boundaries, you’re obsessed with physical boundaries. You literally pick the boundaries for the entire world. [audience laughs] You’re like, “Oh…” [audience whooping] “Africa, here are your boundaries.” “Asia, here are your boundaries.” “Middle East, here are your boundaries.” “Peace.” No, there’s no peace. [audience laughs] We’re around the corner from the election. What’s the biggest issue that the Republicans are using in regards to your safety? [man] The border. The border. [audience laughs] A bunch of Republican senators are out here acting like hormonal teenagers. They’re like, “Hey, Mexico.” [audience laughs] “Respect our boundaries.” [audience laughs] Then there’s a bunch of Mexican uncles at the border. They’re like, “Señor, why is the door locked?” [audience laughs] [speaks in Spanish] “Why is the door locked? Esta es mi casa.” “Don’t ever lock the door!” World War III is about to pop off because disputes over what? Boundaries! Boundaries. That’s gonna be the downfall of Western civilization. Sunaad, do you know what our downfall will be? [man] What? Hoarding! [audience laughs] Our parents love to hoard. [man whoops] Everything, just fucking Subway napkins. Ha, ha! Taco Bell fire sauce. Red crushed pepper from Dominos. Just poverty mentality. [audience cheering and whooping] Go into any immigrant household. Go to the drawer next to the spoons. [audience cheering and whooping] “Why do you have six kilos of Parmesan cheese… [audience laughs] …from Round Table Pizza?” “You can take my green card, but you can’t take my Parmesan cheese!” [man whoops] Not only do our parents physically hoard, they emotionally hoard. [audience laughs] Oh, every grievance, every trauma. Right here. Right here. Every time you fuck up, “I’ll remember.” They never clear cookies and cache. [audience laughs] My parents, they’ve been together 40 years. Okay, they’ve been adjacent for 40 years. [audience laughs] I’ve never seen them hug. I’ve never seen them kiss. They’re just planking in their stubbornness. Just, “Fuck you!” “No, fuck you!” “Fuck you!” “You die!” “No, you die, that way I get the house and I can talk shit about you to the grandkids!” I had to have an intervention. I go, “Mom, Dad!” “You clearly don’t like each other.” [audience laughs] “You obviously don’t love each other.” “So either get a divorce, or go to therapy.” And my dad’s like, “Hasan, I’m not paying someone $200… [audience laughs] …when we can argue in this kitchen for free.” [audience laughing and whooping] And now I’m in therapy. Because I don’t wanna end up like them. But here’s the thing, I don’t think it works. Do you have friends that are in therapy, but they’re still shitty people? All my friends that are therapied up are the most mentally ill people that I know. They’ve just learned fancy words to avoid accountability. I have a friend that still owes me money for a concert. I tried to call him on it. I was like, “Scott, you owe me $350.” He’s like, “I hear you.” [audience laughs] “I receive you.” “But I don’t have the bandwidth.” I’m like, “Dammit, Scott!” Get more bandwidth. [audience laughs] Look, therapy’s important, but it is not a flex. Stop bragging about it. “I’m doing the work.” “I’m unpacking my tru…” I don’t need you to unpack. I need you to change. [audience laughing and whooping] You know what it is? Therapy has to be like a haircut. You can’t tell us about it. We have to notice the difference. [audience laughing and whooping] Listen, man, I’m telling you from experience, I’ve done it all. Don’t waste your money. I’ve done it all. I’ve done all the therapies. CBT. Couples therapy, immersive therapy. Let me just say this, okay? If you go to therapy, you deserve a therapist that understands you culturally. [audience cheering] Because I’ve had all the therapists, okay? I had Janet, okay? Janet didn’t cut it. [audience laughs] Janet, big-scarf energy. Buddha statue. She’s never been to Asia. I was her little anthropology experiment. She’s like, “Interesting, fascinating. This is like a trip to the Orient.” “You know, Hasan, every time we’re in a session and your phone goes off and it says ‘Mom cell, ‘ ‘Dad… ‘ You have this need to pick up.” You go, “boop.” “Why?” “Why?” “Can we talk about boundaries?” [audience laughs] And I’m like, “Janet, shut the fuck up.” [audience laughs] You guys are individualists. We’re collectivists. How do I get you to understand where I’m coming…? “Okay, Janet, pretend this doesn’t say ‘Mom cell.'” “Pretend it says ‘dog cell.'” “Can I pick up?” [audience laughs] She’s like, “Of course!” I’m like, “What’s up, dog? You good?” “Oh my God, Janet, My dog needs insulin.” “Should I give her insulin or establish boundaries?” She goes, “What kind of dog?” “A goldendoodle.” “Not your goldendoodle!” I go, “I know.” [laughing] Oh! I see the dog people are in their feelings right now. [laughs] Oh, shit. My buddy Prashanth told me, he’s like, “Hasan, do not do the dog material on Netflix.” “Dogs are sacred in America.” “Talk about something less controversial, like the Middle East.” [audience laughing and whooping] [laughs] But it’s not… No! It’s insane. It’s fucking insane. There are… “I love my dog.” “My dog is a member of my family.” You people are out of your fucking minds. “But you don’t… you don’t get it.” “You don’t get it.” “Once you lock eyes…” No, no, no, I get it. The only reason why you love your dog is because you’re never in trouble with your dog. You’re a piece of shit, and your dog is too dumb to know that you’re a piece of shit. [audience laughing and whooping] You love your dog. And you love your mom. But only one of them gets to live in your home. [audience laughs] Oh, ho-ho, but best believe the day your dog is able to talk, and it’ll happen in our lifetime… [audience laughs] …and he’s like, “Hey!” “Why are your pillowcases so dirty?” [audience laughs] You’ll be like, “Chauncey… boundaries.” [audience laughs] [Hasan laughs] What was I expecting? Why the fuck was I listening to Janet give me opinions on how to deal with immigrant parents? We fired Janet. “Janet, you’re out.” “Jithra, you’re in.” [audience laughs] Now we have a South Asian therapist. She gets it. Jithra’s downloaded all the seasons of our culture’s trauma, okay? She knows all the baggage we wanna get rid of. She knows all the heirlooms we wanna pass on. She knows that we’re building a new future for our kids. I remember in one of our sessions, like ten minutes in, she cut me off, she goes, “Hasan, I know what’s wrong. I’m not supposed to, but I’ll tell you.” I go, “Jithra, this is what the fuck I’m talking about!” “You know we love shortcuts.” “Be direct. Talk to me.” She goes, “I don’t know if anyone’s told you this, Hasan, but you’re pretty manic.” “Now, you have something that the eldest child in every family from Beige-istan has.” [woman] Whoo! “The eldest child always has something called, ‘Good kid syndrome.'” [audience whooping and applauding] “The eldest child of the family feels like they have to take care of everybody in the family.” “Oh, Mom needs this.” “Oh, but your dad needs this.” “Your sister said this, but your brother did that.” “Your aunt’s doing this, but your uncle did this.” “And you feel like you have to plug every hole.” “But you’re always one hole behind.” [audience laughs] And I go, “That’s how I feel.” [audience laughs] “You probably feel really anxious around your loved ones.” “I feel so anxious.” [audience laughs] “You probably have a lot of secrets.” I go, “I have so many secrets.” “Dark secrets.” I go, “They’re fucking dark, Jithra.” “Now, if you wanna cast a light on that darkness, we really need to talk about your kinks.” [audience laughs] What? “What are your kinks, Hasan?” We don’t talk about this in Beige-istan. Individual pleasure. BDSM, sadism, voyeurism, torture, humiliation. [imitates whip cracking] Whipping. “What’s your kink?” And I… Acceptance. [audience laughs] That’s all I’ve ever wanted. I don’t want a ball gag. [audience cheering and applauding] I don’t want latex. Just put me in a padded room with my wife and my dad, and have them gently whisper in my ear. “Hey, big boy.” “Guess what?” “No one is mad at you.” [audience laughs] And I will cream my pants. This is my wife’s kink, all right? We’re in a padded room. My dad’s not there. [audience laughs] And I whisper in her ear. And I go, “Hey, babe.” “Guess what?” “When my mom is old and decrepit, I won’t let her live with us.” [audience laughs] [Hasan] Ho, ho! I see a lot of women clapping! Really? Really? I thought we were the good progressives. I thought we support all women. Except my mother-in-law. Fuck that bitch! Really? That’s where our beautiful collective spirit dies. It dies at mother-in-law? Dude, I’m in the session. My wife’s kink is boundaries. I go, “Babe, we cannot have this.” “I know my parents are insane, but we cannot do this.” “Let’s not even be progressive. Let’s be practical.” “If we kick our parents out and our kids see it… [audience laughing] …we might be the first Indian homeless people in America.” [audience whooping] Because best believe 40 years from now, we’re both gonna be built like gulab jamuns. I’ll have diabetes. Both of our knees are gonna be replaced. I’ll have the CPAP machine. I’ll be 80. Thinking about running for president. Imagine this. Think about it. In 40 years, what if we show up with the CPAP machine and the cane? What if we show up to our son’s door and he’s got a chain on the door? [imitating ragged breathing] Just like, “Oh.” “Oh, hey, Mom, Dad, what up?” [imitating ragged breathing] “What up?” “Son, can we die in your home?” “Oh, Dad!” “Dad, this is a bad time, Dad.” “See, I’m dating this girl from Palo Alto, and we’re in couples therapy, and the therapist says we should establish boundaries, especially with our mothers.” If my son said that about my wife, I would fucking kill that kid. I would run to the car. I’d get a gun. I would blow that fucking door down. I’d go, “Get on the fucking ground, you ungrateful piece of shit!” He’d be like, “Oh my God, Dad, where did you get that gun?” “I got a gun for this joke, you idiot. Don’t fact-check comedy.” “Listen to me, we gave you everything.” “We got rid of all of our baggage. “We gave you every heirloom.” “We still go to therapy. We still fuck.” “You have any idea what you did to your mother’s hips? I love them.” “But you destroyed your mother’s hips, so guess what?” “She gets to die in your fucking house.” “And how many times do I have to tell you this?” “In Beige-istan, we never lock the door.” [audience cheering and applauding] [“On My Way” playing] ♪ Don’t you slow down ♪ ♪ Don’t you look down We’re at new heights now ♪ ♪ All on my feet and my heart… ♪ San Jose, thank you so much.

              " 'tim': ['Tim Dillon: This Is Your Country (2024)\\nGenre: Comedy, Stand-up\\nDirector: N/A\\nWriters: N/A\\nStars: Tim Dillon \\xa0Comedian Tim Dillon engages with everyday Americans, discussing topics such as cryptocurrency, OnlyFans, and other outrageous issues they face in this unscripted comedy special. * * * Hello, pigs. I think we can all agree that America is a rotting corpse of an empire and we live in hell. So when Netflix gave us a bunch of money to make a… whatever-the-fuck-we’re-doing about the election, we figured, why waste our time talking to politicians? Let’s talk to the food-poisoned, drug-addicted sex criminals who live here. [crowd cheering] Yeah! [Tim Dillon] Come on. My name is Tim Dillon, and regrettably, This Is Your Country. [cheering] [1980’s-style synth theme playing] Why is it your business if your cousin wants to pop her P for cash? Kill that Canadian bitch after the fucking show. [chanting] USA! USA! One coffee a day, not two or three. Okay, Hitler. [crowd laughing] If you love her, pay her. Thank you! You know why? It’s the greatest country in the world. [crowd applauding, cheering] [chanting] Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! [cheering continues] [music fades] He massages BBLs on OnlyFans for a living, but he’s here to tell his girlfriend he also is a porn star. [crowd whooping] That’s right, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome William to the show. [funky synth music playing] [crowd cheering] [indistinct chatter] William, how are you? [William] Yes. I’m doing amazing. You massage Brazilian butt lifts for a living. Yes, I do. And you do that on OnlyFans? I do that on OnlyFans, and I do that for my job as well. And do you do any other type of massage? I mean, I’m trained in all areas, but I focus on the… the glutes. [scattered laughing] What is it? Is it like kneading a good sourdough? What is… [laughs] In fact, know what, William? Why don’t you just show us? No problem. Bring out the BBL. [crowd cheering] [Tim] Bring out the BBL, baby! William, I want you to stand up, and I want you to walk the audience through a BBL massage. [William] Definitely. Definitely. Well, this… this might be pre-BBL. [crowd laughing] Gotta lube it up or moisturize it up, put a little bit in your hands, and then you want to just slowly caress. Is there any special technique other than what I… what we just saw, really, is you just kind of grabbing an ass. [William] Yes. [crowd laughing] So as you’re massaging it, you want to just check in with them, you know, from time to time, ask them, “Hey, how’s it doing?” “You want more pressure?” Sometimes, you know, they’ll moan instead of saying yes, so… [Tim] Right. You know, when they moan, they’ll probably moan like, “Oh, yes. Yes!” Does your girlfriend have any issue with you doing this specific type of massage? Unfortunately, my girlfriend does have a huge issue with it. Yeah. [laughs] But I try to explain to her… That’s shocking that she has a big… I’m trying to explain to her, “This is what I was born to do.” [Tim] That’s right. I was put on Earth to do this. That’s right. To do this. [crowd cheering] He knows what he wants. Now, listen, you didn’t fly here just to show people, “Here’s how to massage an ass that we bought at the Halloween store.” [scattered chuckling] Okay? I’m kidding, this couple let us borrow it, you know? What, uh… [laughing] You’re here to confess to your girlfriend that you used to do porn. Yeah. [boisterous cheering] [crowd chanting] Bring her out! William… Bring her out! Bring her out! All right, ladies and gentlemen… [chanting fades] please welcome Shireiny to the show. [cheering] Are you fucking kidding me? Yo, three years. Three years of this fucking bullshit I gotta deal with you. This shit is fucking crazy and mad embarrassing. Shireiny, what is… What is making you, uh, upset? What’s making me upset is he be around ass and titties all day. Like, do you not have enough at home? It’s a job. All right, well, get another job! It’s a job. Get another job! Why don’t you go fucking work at Target? Huh? You got the outfit for it. Target. [crowd laughing, cheering] [William] What a comedienne. What a jokester. Little jokester. How would you feel if I was around dick all day? Huh? Dick in my face all day? Well, William is here to tell you something. William, this is your moment of truth. [William sighs] I used to do… I did porn. What? [crowd gasping] No. It was in the past. Y’all pranking me, right? Nah. It was in the past. It was… It’s… Can you be more specific by “porn?” What do you mean by porn? I recorded myself having sex with women. That does sound like porn. [crowd laughing] And you brought me here to tell me that? I want to come clean, to put everything on the table. I wanna just start fresh. I’m gonna sit over here, ’cause I’m disgusted right now. [Tim] Wow. [crowd cheering] William, William… Why didn’t you tell me that when we met? Because if you can’t handle… If you can’t handle me doing massages, I know for a fact you could not handle me doing porn. Come on now. If you can’t handle him at his BBL massage, you don’t deserve him at his, uh, porn. [crowd chuckling] There’s somebody else who’s been listening as well. It’s not just your beautiful girlfriend here. What? He got another girl? [Tim] No, hold on. Well, yes and no. [crowd] Ooh… [Tim] Yes and no. Nah. Ladies and gentlemen, William’s mother is backstage. [crowd cheering, laughing] And she probably has a few opinions. Please welcome Sata, everybody! [crowd cheering] Hey, Mama! [William] Yo… Well, fill her in, William, for what’s been going on. [William exhaling] Yo, this is crazy. [Shireiny] Shit is crazy. I, uh… Yo, what the hell? I came clean to Shireiny about me doing porn. You knew he used to do porn? Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait a second. Doing porn? Yes. I did porn. Not OnlyFans, porn porn. Same thing. Having sex? It’s not. It’s the… Yes. It was, like, three years ago. [man] He’s still doing it! [woman] Liar! William, when did you stop? When did you stop doing porn? -Wait a second. I’m sorry. [Tim] Yeah. You went to school… Right. …to do film. [crowd laughing] I’m not understanding. I bought you all the equipment. I bought you cameras. I know. I bought you lights, I bought you booms, I bought you the stuff. I’m not understanding. I make a really good living. Can you tell us how much money you’re making doing this? Six figures. ‘Cause I’m not only doing the porn, I can… I shoot the porn, I edit the porn. I’m knee-deep in this porn industry. [crowd applauding] Yeah! Whoo! Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. What’s your porn name? It’s “Long Willy.” [crowd laughing] Long… [laughs] Sata, your son is a very enterprising young man… I wanna say this. Kim Kardashian, she had a sex tape. Look… That was a secret sex tape. [William] Wait! She had a sex tape. A billionaire off a sex tape. [Tim] That’s a good point. That’s a good point for William. [William] Come on. Kim Kardashian… Thank you. …that is our most successful whore. Yes. [Tim] That is a very good point. Can you stand up, sir? Now, you watch porn. Let me ask you a question. [laughing] How do you feel about a young man doing porn and making money from it? I think he’s an entrepreneur. My man. If you had a child, would you mind if they did porn? I wouldn’t let them do porn. [Shireiny] Exactly. So you… Do you find that a little hypocritical? Yeah. But you wouldn’t let your child do porn? [laughing] No. But you watch a lot of fucking porn. I mean, if people went on your laptop right now, they wouldn’t be able to sleep, let’s be honest. And it’s not regular porn. It’s women’s heads going through glass tables, it’s bad. You can’t cum unless someone’s bleeding. Let’s be honest. The things that are on your laptop… All right, sit down before the FBI gets here. Uh… Are you massaging anyone right now on OnlyFans that you had sex with in the past? Potentially. Yeah. What? Shireiny. In the past. In the past. Yes. Are you kidding me? You should not be dealing with no girl you slept with whether it’s work or not. It does not matter. So if I was a doctor and she was dying, I can’t… “Sorry, we had sex, I can’t save your life. Gotta die.” No! Let the bitch die. It doesn’t work like that. You let the bitch die. [Tim] I do see William’s point. I do see William’s point. If you were massaging a woman’s ass to life and being paid for it on OnlyFans, I understand. How many people in this audience think they should rise above this and just stay together? Yeah! [scattered applause] That’s a fair amount. How many people in this audience think that Shireiny has the right to say “fuck you”? [loud cheering] William, there’s one more thing that you have to do right now. One more thing you have to say before God, before this country, before your mother, before your beautiful girlfriend, and we’re going to give you a chance to say it right now. -Oh my God. I’m scared now. [exhaling] Shit, bro. Let me get up. I gotta get up for this. Where you going? [exhales] I will beat you up if you come over here and try to hug me, like… Look, look, look, look. [sighs] Look, babe, we done been through a lot, and you always been there for me at my lowest, you know? When I’m down there massaging women, my hands may be on their ass, but my eyes are always on you. You’re full of shit. You know? You know? [applause] You’re a fool. If you go for this, you’re a fool. And you’re about to cry, you’re crazy. And I know, I know my dick is out there on the Internet. Little Willy. It’s not Little Willy. But, look, babe. This might be the craziest thing I ever did, man. [exhales] I want to be… What? [crowd cheering] I want to be… I want to be your porn star. No. I want to be your porn star for the rest of my life. There’s no way that she’s gonna accept that. Close that. No way. Will you marry me? You’re crazy. I wanna be your porn star. [screaming] Yeah! [Tim] Give it up for them. Give it up for them. That is a happy couple. [crowd applauding] [Tim] That is a beautiful… That is love. OnlyFans? How about OnlyFam? Come on! Come on, hug it out! Hug it out! Everybody get up. Come on, Mom, this is beautiful. You’ve got your son, your daughter-in-law. Thank you, guys, so much. Look at that. That’s love. That’s love. That’s what love is about. Love is… There’s a power in that. How you feel about that? What do you think? I thought it was gross. ‘Cause they were Black? [crowd laughs] No! No. Orange County is one of the most racist places in the entire world, and it’s a little disgusting to have this white bitch judge these beautiful people. It’s wrong. I don’t like it. I… I wish you would have taken another thing. And now, he immigrated to this country 35 years ago, and now he wants to get the hell out of here unless his son can convince him to stay. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to Sergio. [upbeat synth music playing] [crowd cheering] [Tim] There he is, Sergio. Sergio, welcome to the show. Thank you. Is there anything or anyone that could convince you to stay in this country? Nah. I, uh, I have decided that America is not the American Dream for me no more. And I’m ready to get out of here. Yeah. Yeah. I’m out of here, you know? Okay, now, why… why do you say that? Uh, to me, it’s not the same country anymore. You have to have a high-speed Internet, you have to pay extra gigabytes on your phone if you go over. Yes. So you’re going over on the phone. Even the American people have to pay extra. So your problem really is a data plan. [crowd laughing] So if we just bring you to Verizon, you might stay? But you sound like you want to self-deport. Uh… [laughs] [Tim] Which is… We might say that. I think what’s holding me to stay here is my family. [Tim] That’s right. But, uh, you know, my sons. Yes. I was not made in China, I was made in Mexico. They were born in USA. [Tim] Oh, interesting. [giggles] [chuckles] So you said… [all laughing] So you said you were not made in China, you were made in Mexico. I was made in Mexico. And those kids were born in the USA. What a fucked-up song that is, you know? [crowd laughing] If anybody can convince you to stay, it is your son, and he’s going to tell you why he wants you to stay in America. Give it up for Luis, everybody. [crowd cheering] [Tim] Give it up for Luis. [crowd chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! [continues chanting] [Tim] That’s right. [chanting fades] Luis, what do you love about America? I mean, we have football, all the American sports. -Yeah, okay. All the money you can make. [Tim] That’s right. Women. That’s right. Okay. [man cheering] Yeah! That’s right. This guy. Stand up for a minute, because you agree with him. Will you stand up? Let’s stand up for a minute. The Unabomber wants to say a few words here. Now, you agreed, when Luis was talking about how much money you can make, and the women… What do you say to him? Well, honestly, I’m about women, but I’m not necessarily about America. And I mean, the ladies down South… [crowd booing] [man] I mean, I’m not anti-America. I’m, like, I’m neutral. Come on. Come on, let him… Hold on, let him… let him finish. Now, the ladies… What do you mean, “The ladies down South”? Muy caliente. I got you. All right. Now, you are with this lovely man. Yes, this is my boyfriend. That’s your boyfriend. Yeah. When… Stand up for a minute. When… When he says he likes these muy caliente ladies from down South, how does that make you feel? I mean, like, power to him, he’s with me right now, you know. I enjoy him and everything, but, you know, if he was ever to meet one of these ladies and he wanted to do that, I’d be, you know… More power to him. [scattered cheers] Look what a great country this is. Look how understanding these two homeless people are about each other’s sexual proclivities. There’s… [chuckling] There’s no other country in the world where you’ll have an unhoused couple like this crawl out of their tent, go to a Tim Dillon taping and say, “Honey, you can fuck whoever you want as long as you steal some canned food and bring it back to this tent at night.” I mean, look at these two. This is what America is about. [crowd chanting] USA! USA! USA! This is what America is about. This Orange County couple is so fucking scared right now. Knife them after the show. Run up on them and knife ’em. Take their fucking BMW and their fucking sailboat or whatever. Well, is anyone an immigrant in this audience? Okay, we want to hear from immigrants, especially this white woman who’s lying about it. [crowd laughing] She better have a real fucking Ukrainian accent when I get up to this fucking woman. Hold on, where did you come from? Canada. [crowd jeering] [chanting] USA! USA! USA! [chanting fades] Kill that Canadian bitch after the fucking show, okay? You fucking… These tweakers are going to light you on fire after this fucking show. These extras from Breaking Bad, these monsters. We paid for their STD check before they came here. This free clinic where we got these people. Sir, you’re a different color. [crowd laughing] Where… Yeah, stand up. Stand up. Where do you come from? Uh, I was born here. Enough with this! That’s not what I mean. I mean in the racist way. Like the Orange County people would say. Oh. Where does your family come from? Mexico. Both from Mexico. And look how… And you are thriving here. I actually love it here, yeah. What do you do for a living? Customer support for education tech. Kill yourself. Here’s the thing… I cannot find one reason to keep this man in this shithole of a country. I cannot. I believe we have a patriot who will come out here and convince Sergio once and for all that this is the greatest country in the world. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Bandit to the show. [applause, cheering] [Tim] Give it up for Bandit! Give it up for Bandit! Take a seat. USA! [crowd chanting] USA! USA! USA! What you two should do, I’m not kidding, is get with him later and do some fun home invasions. You know what I mean? Bandit, do you feel freer in America than you would be other places? [Bandit] Of course, Tim. Of course I do. I mean, there’s… sure… Okay, you have a few options, right? Mainly, at least for me, Britain and Canada. I don’t wanna go to Canada because they’re not real. That’s mooses pretending to be people. Well, you’re a person pretending to be a dog. This is true. I would get along great with them. Now, Sergio, just look at Bandit and tell him what could be possibly wrong with this country? [Bandit] What’s wrong with America? Look at this person, who I will not gender. Look at this person, Sergio. What could possibly be wrong with this country? Look, if you want to look for an apartment, you have to pay the first, the last, plus deposit. Six hundred eighty score to get the apartment. You have that? That is true. He’s bringing up a good point about the apartment rental process, Bandit. Which I don’t think you have been in. Uh, just a hunch. [Bandit] That’s America, baby. Money flows, dude. If you ain’t ready to pay to have an apartment, why… Don’t go to one! Luis, you seem very uncomfortable. [crowd laughing] [Tim] You seem incredibly uncomfortable right now. Take a look at this. This is… There it is. Sergio, yes. I think he makes more money standing at a corner with a sign. Moving it. [laughing] That’s not a bad point. Bandit, make your last plea to Sergio. You’re the one we brought on this stage because you exemplify what America is in its current moment. [Bandit] Sergio, I beg you. Stay here. We can go to Target together. We can go get a Java Chip Frappé, we can walk through the park, have a wonderful time. Maybe fall in love. I don’t know. It’s the land of opportunity. I would love for you to stay here with us and be a part of this great, beautiful nation. Give it up for Bandit, everyone, that’s a great… [crowd applauding] Sergio, are you gonna stay, or are you gonna go? What is it? Uh… There is, uh, nothing that make me stay. I’m leaving. And I’m leaving America. The American Dream, it’s over. [crowd booing] I’m telling you, I’m out of here. I’m out of here, you know? [crowd chanting] Adios! Adios! That’s… That’s the way he feels. Give it up for Sergio, [crowd cheering] [Tim] Luis, Bandit, everybody. Thank them so much. Give it up for them. Give it up. Thank you, guys. It’d be hilarious if you remove the dog head and it was RFK. [imitating Kennedy] “I’m going to dress up like a dog on Netflix because I want to be the President of the United States.” [crowd laughing] Up now, she’s a body-positive feel-good fun type. Her mom is an overbearing almond witch that wants to control what goes in her body. Ladies and gentlemen, let’s meet Livi. [crowd cheering] [funky synth music playing] Livi, baby. How are you? Thank you for coming, Livi. How are you? I’m good. How are you? I’m doing good. So your mom gets on your nerves. Yes. What is the problem? She comments on every single thing I eat, she comments on me working out, anything I put into my body, my coffee. What do you do to your coffee? Okay, I put syrups in my coff… I do an iced vanilla latte. There’s nothing wrong… What kind of syrups do you put in your coffee? Like, just vanilla. Just vanilla? How much? How many pumps? Like, four pumps. [Tim] We pump it up? [Livi] We pump it up! Yes! Do we pump it up? She pumps it up. Yes! Four pumps. Pump it up. And not half pumps. You make them at Starbucks, slam on that bitch. -Full pumps. Yes. Fuck yeah. Slam it. Full pumps. Okay. So now, your mother, what does she do for a living? She’s a Pilates instructor. She’s a Pilates instructor. [Livi] Yes. Yes, she is. [crowd] Ooh. [Livi] Yes. [Tim] And she… [Livi] Yeah. And she is on your case. And do you stand up for yourself and your rights as an American? You know what? I try my best. I do tell her to, like, fuck off. “Mom, fuck off.” “I’m going to do what I want to do. I’m an adult.” Can she hear you over the drive-thru speaker? No, no… No. She can’t. [Tim] That’s the problem. I have OCD, I have anxie… I’m a normal girl, I have anxiety. And she’s like, “It’s all the fucking Starbucks you drink.” “That’s what’s giving you anxiety. The vanilla syrup.” Now, what does… how does OCD manifest in your life? Um, I like to touch things. Okay. And, like, three times. You touch something three times? Yeah. And then eat it? No, I don’t eat it. No! [crowd laughing] My mom told you to say that. My mom told you to say that. You love your mother, but you want her to butt out. I want her to butt out. Get the fuck out of my fridge. Get the fuck out of your fridge. Because… Because there’s no room. Now… [Livi] No. [crowd laughing] Let’s… Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to meet Livi’s mom, everybody? [cheering] [chanting] Bring her out! [Tim] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Dena! [cheering] There she is. They love you. They love you. [Tim] Dena! Dena, Dena, Dena, how are you? I’m good. [Tim] Welcome to the show. So you’re… Basically, you’re asking your daughter, “I just want you to make healthier decisions.” Absolutely. What the fuck is wrong with you? [crowd laughing] I don’t think she’s old enough to make decisions. -Okay, what? Okay. -[crowd booing] Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. [Dena] Wait. If I wanna eat a fucking donut, I wanna eat a fucking donut, you don’t need to tell me what to do. I’m 25. Since I was a child, I don’t know any life that’s not like this. Oh, that’s… Oh, shut the fuck up. You know. Yeah. [crowd] Oh! [jeering] No, it’s so true. [Tim] Ladies. No, imagine being five and she’s yelling at you about Oreos. Imagine being five and that happened. We didn’t have them. Well, you didn’t… You… You… You didn’t have Oreos? No. Well, she found them. [Livi] No, I did. [crowd laughing] [Tim] She found them. Yeah. You have a list of foods you don’t want her to eat? [Dena] I do. Take it out. Take the list out, Dena. Take the list out. Take the list out right now. [laughing] No. First one, coffee with syrups is horrible for your body. Only… Only… No, there is no way. No way. There we go. Only according to doctors. [laughing] But here’s Livi’s point, “Life’s short, pump it up.” Exactly. That’s what I said. [Tim] Oh! [crowd cheering] No. Life’s short and with those pumps, even shorter, but here’s the point… You can have one coffee a day, not two or three. No syrups. One coffee a day with no syrup. Okay, Hitler. Go on. Literally. [laughing] [Tim] Go on. I would like her to give up everything white. [crowd booing] [Tim] Wait a minute, hold on. Sugar, flour, pasta, bread, rice, cheese. [Tim] Okay. [Dena] Dairy. [booing continues] [Tim] What would be a happy medium? She’s not gonna give up everything white. Can you propose something slightly realistic here? She should be able to give up white for two weeks. White for two weeks. [Dena] Yeah. You know what’s gonna happen after two weeks? She’s gonna have a white party. She’s gonna go crazy. Do you think it’s wrong to try to micromanage your adult daughter’s diet? [crowd] Yes! No. No. Not if I’m worried about her well-being. But are you worried about her well-being or your well-being? [crowd applauding] Exactly. [Tim] Oh, Dena! [Livi] ‘Cause she’s projecting. It’s not like she is going to your house and forcing you to put vanilla in your coffee. I’ve never done it. Never done that. [Tim] Right? Does she show up and try to face-fuck you with sourdough bread? [laughing] [Tim] No. Never done that. She’s not doing that ’cause she’s not sharing her food. Now listen to me… There’s nothing… Dena, let’s trim the fat. What do you really want your daughter to… [laughing] It’s not that funny. It’s not that funny. [Tim] Stand up here. Stand up. All right. You need an almond mom. I do. Me and you… Let’s be honest. Me and you need Dena, we need Dena to follow us around. Do you have a mother? I do. Does she butt into your life? She does. I wish she’d fuck off. Yeah. [crowd laughing] [crowd applauding] Dena, let’s be honest. You heard it there, he wants you to fuck off. Sir, now, what do you think about this? Do you have children? Uh, not yet. All right, sit down. You know, I, uh… [laughing] [Tim] Nobody gives a shit. Can you stand up? Stand up. Now, this man shot President Trump. So I want to ask you, what do you think about these people? I did not shoot Trump. Okay. [laughing] [man 2] What do I think about ’em? Do you have any opinion? You’re a young man, white, what do you think? Uh, I don’t know, I think talking shit about your mom is crazy. [crowd agreeing] I… [man in crowd] Yeah! Dena. Do you think it’s possible that for the sake of your daughter’s health, that you could ease up a little bit? I will try. [Tim] “I will try.” Well, we have some good news, Dena. You’re about to have your first test. Me and your daughter are feeling slightly frisky. And we would like to have a little snack. It’s a healthy snack. Okay. It’s from an organic, healthy… place. Okay? Let’s see if you can do it. Okay. Please bring out the healthy snack. [crowd cheering] [Dena] Just not the cherries. [Livi] No, you gotta eat the cherries. The cherries are bad for you. Now, listen… Listen to me. She’s pissed. Do you feel triggered right now? [laughing] [Tim] Now… I want you to try. Dena, get in here. Okay. [Tim] Get in here a little bit. Give it a shot. Give it a shot, Dena. Don’t want the strawberry. Is this mint or pistachio? Who the fuck knows? [crowd laughing] Mmm. This is mint. This is mint. Give it up. Have a little bit! This is mint. Come on, Mom! Get in there! Come on! It’s good. Go, Mom. [Tim yelling] Come on! [crowd cheering] Eat the cherry! Get it. Eat the cherry! Dena! Dena! Dena! [chanting] Dena! Dena! [Livi] Eat the cherry! Guys, give it up for Livi and Dena! Give it up for them, everybody! [crowd cheering] Thank you so much. That’s $10,000 of Netflix’s money. That’s… This was the last season of House of Cards they didn’t make. [laughing] I appreciate that. A round of applause again for Dena and Livi, everybody. [crowd cheering] That goes right to the homeless. Take that outside to the homeless encampment right now. I’m still trying to process this row. This row is a wild row, I like this row. This is a wild row. This white guy is so scared in the middle of this row right now, he has no idea what happened. You just landed in the middle of a Kamala Harris rally. You have no idea what’s going on. This white guy is terrified, but he’s also aroused, and that’s what it’s about. That’s America right now. Are we ready to meet some new, fun people? [crowd whooping, cheering] He said she’s turned her back on God and sold her soul to OnlyFans. But what he really wants is her to collaborate on YouTube with him again. Welcome to Gen Z hell. Everybody, welcome Christian. [upbeat synth music playing] [crowd cheering] [Tim] Christian, come out. Thank you. Sit down. Christian, take a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Take a seat, Christian. Now, you used to collaborate a lot with your cousin Bela. -Yes, I did. On YouTube. Yes. She was like my best friend, we grew up together. I’ve known her since, you know, I was a baby. [Tim] You’ve known her since you were a baby? She’s on YouTube. Yes. Disrespecting men. What is that? Can you define that? So, she’ll post a video and be like, you know, “Hey,” you know, “cuss word,” um, “give me some money,” you know. Like, disrespects them and asks for money, and then they’ll actually send it, kind of like a gold digger, but, you know, online. So you don’t think that’s a good use of her time? Um… [sighs] Honestly, I think she should do what we used to do. Like, different types of content. What did you used to do? We used to do just normal challenge videos, you know, a basic… [crowd booing] [Tim] Christian. Nobody wants you and your cousin doing fucking challenge videos. Okay, my bad, my bad. They would rather her doing findom or whatever she’s doing on YouTube. That’s right. [Christian] My bad. My bad. [crowd cheering] Should we bring her out? Should we meet her, everybody? [cheering loudly] [Tim] Should we meet her? [crowd chanting] Bring her out! Bring her out! Bring her out! Let’s bring out Bela, everybody. [crowd cheering, whooping] Hi. He says only God, she says OnlyFans. Now, Bela, what is the beef? What is his problem? He has a different perspective on how I make my money because, you know, his parents still pay his bills. [Tim] Whoa! What? Wait. [crowd jeering] Whoa, Christian. [Christian] Wait. [chuckles] Mommy and Daddy don’t pay my bills, so… That’s right. Men on the Internet do. Now… [scattered laughter] What do you do to, uh, get these men to pay? Bully them. My mom’s literally subscribed to my OnlyFans to keep me accountable. I don’t post anything inappropriate. Your mom is subscribed to your OnlyFans to keep you accountable? [Bela] Yeah. That should have been the title of the segment. Now… [laughing] Now, Christian, why is it your business if your cousin wants to pop her P for cash? Um… Uh, you know, I care about her and I look out for her, I love her, she’s, like, my best friend, like, I want to be involved. -I want the best for her. If you love her, pay her. [crowd cheering] -Thank you. All right, fine. Fine! I don’t do anything inappropriate, I don’t talk dirty, I don’t sell my body. I literally bully them. They just like to be degraded. Mm… How long do you plan on making money like this? I make 20K a month off these guys, so until that goes away… Whoa. [Christian] What? [Tim] Wow. Now, get up for a minute. Get up. Let’s be honest, both of you. Now, you’re a subscriber. Is it… [Christian] Wait, what? Is it weird to see her in real life? [chuckles] No. Yeah, now, what do you think about this? Who do you think is right here? The… You know, I don’t even know which, but, you know, what’s going on? 20K a month is good. I’d… I’d say her. [Bela] Thank you. Okay, what do you think about this? Her too. Okay. Thank you. Right. Thank you. It’s the Charlottesville Riot. Thank you, guys, for coming here. This is such a weird Gen Z fucking problem. Know what I mean? I get it. This is normal! You don’t want her to do fucking OnlyFans, but you want her to waste time with you, do YouTube, that’s the worst argument. Thank you. [Tim] You know what I mean? You’re not offering her a better alternative. Okay. Um, we could play Minecraft, Fortnite… [Tim] Oh my God. [crowd booing] Oh my God, dude, no. [Christian] What? Boo! [Tim] No Minecraft. Where’s the money? Can you stand up, sir? Can you stand up? You got an erection when you heard the word “Minecraft.” [crowd laughing] Now, Fortnite is… Now, let me… Will you play Fortnite with this guy so he doesn’t bother this woman? He seems a bit boring. Yeah. Yeah. It’s crazy to ask… Are you a gamer? Not particularly. Really? Yeah. OnlyFans is more fun than gaming, it seems. Okay, all right. Would you subscribe? How much is it a month? [Bela] I’ll bully you! I don’t want to be bullied, no. You don’t wanna be bullied? He had enough of it in high school. All right. [crowd applauding] Come here, what do you think? Are you… Who do you… Are you… Will you stand up for Christian? No one will. What do you think? I will stand for my family. And them both are my family. That’s my cousin! Oh, this is your cousin? Really? [Bela] That’s my cousin! So who do you… Who do you agree with? [crowd booing] [cousin] Listen, as family… Pick a side! As family goes, we like to stick together, so I don’t want to choose both. But make your money. Respectfully. All right. That’s fair. [Bela] Thank you! That’s fair. All right, that’s fair. He gets it. Bela, is there anything, is there any way that you would stop doing OnlyFans? No. All right. Give it up for Bela and Christian, everybody. Clap it up for them. They should both go to jail. [crowd booing] [Tim] I’ve never met a more… I’ve never met a more hateable person. All right. I’ve never met a more hateable person. All right. [crowd continues booing] I hope the homeless attack them on the way out. I hope… I hope their skin is stripped off their body, one by one. I’m kidding. They’re cute. What are you gonna do? I mean… And now, he’s here to tell his wife he lost $200,000 on NFTs, but don’t worry, he’s still a true believer. Let’s meet Francesco, everybody. [upbeat synth music playing] [crowd cheering] [Tim] Yeah! What’s up? [Tim] Francesco. Francesco, you look like every friend I had who lost money on NFTs. [Tim laughs] Tell us what happened. Well, the first NFT that I invested in was a… was a picture of a 3D monkey. Was it the Bored Ape? It was a derivative of that. It was a derivative? Yes. So, it wasn’t the Bored Ape Yacht Club, it was a knockoff… [crowd booing] Hey! Hey! Hey! Jesus Christ. Hold on. This guy’s out here baring his soul. [laughing] Now, how much… do you go and lose with NFTs after it’s all said and done? So, you know, after we were buying and selling and, you know, doing all that, I was in the hole about 200 grand, you know, by the end of it [crowd] Ooh. Okay. And your wife does not know this? No, she has no clue that I lost that much money, yeah. Yeah. [chuckles] [crowd] Ooh. How do you think she’s gonna react when you tell her? Well, my wife actually does have a finance background, and she works for a big financial institution, and she’s been telling me that this is not a… wasn’t a good idea for a long time. You know, for sure. So, wait a minute. Your wife, with the financial background, was telling you that this was not a good idea? No. And you still dumped $200,000 of family money into the… To be fair, $200,000 was what I lost. I dumped a lot more than that into it. [Tim] Okay, all right. All right. To be… If we’re gonna be honest, air out our dirty laundry. [Tim] Okay, that’s fine. All right, everybody, are you guys ready? [crowd cheering] [chanting] Bring her out! This show is all about getting honest. Bring her out! Bring her out! That’s right. Bring her out! Bring her out! Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Lindsey! [crowd cheering] [Lindsey laughing] [Tim] Lindsey, welcome to the show. Welcome to the show. Lindsey, well… Aw… [laughing] Oh, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey. Welcome to the show. Congratulations. Thank you. How many months are you? Eight months. Wow. Give her a round of applause, everybody. Congratulations. [cheering] [Tim] Congratulations. And you’re aware that your husband got into crypto and NFTs. What’d you think about that at the time? You know, I… I feel it’s kind of bullshit. Um, it’s… [crowd cheering] [Lindsey laughing] Your husband brought you here because he wants to confess something. Oh God. To you. Okay. And we’re gonna let him take it away. Um… Yeah, so… [crowd laughing, jeering] You know, so, you know, we’re having, you know, another child, you know. -Yeah. And, uh… I wanted to make sure that, you know, we came clean about everything in our financial situation. Uh-huh. Our financial… Uh, you know, the story of our financials, you know… [exhales sharply] You sound like Joe Biden. Yeah. [laughing] I, you know… Yeah, I got out. Yeah. [woman] Spit it out already! [crowd jeering] So… [crowd chanting] Spit it out! Spit it out! Spit it out! Spit it out! Spit it out! Spit it out! Spit it out! [chanting fades] So, you know, to come clean, um… I did lose, uh, you know, around $200,000 of our money in that. What? [crowd] Ooh! I did lose about… about that amount. However… However… Wait. Wait a minute. You know, there are new opportunities. You know, there are new coins. [crowd laughing] So it… it… it… So there’s these new coins called shitcoins now. Babe. And… [Tim] Hold on. Hold on. Let’s… Let’s give your wife Lindsey a minute to just deal with what you just said before you start pitching her on shitcoins, you psychopath. I mean, Jesus Christ. I mean… [Lindsey] Hold on. Two hundred thousand dollars? Yep. Are you insane? Are you insane? [sighing] Two hundred thousand dollars? Only when what you do… You know, when people say what you do is crazy, only then are you doing enough. That’s what I live by, that’s my… [Lindsey] Babe. That’s my, like… [crowd booing] Two hundred thousand dollars? Wait a minute, what Gary Vaynerchuk quote is that? Come here for a second. If this guy… If anyone will agree with you, it’s gonna be someone like this here. Come here, let me… You look pretty sympathetic to this. Do you support… This is a guy you’d do coke with in Miami. Now, what are you… When you hear this guy, what do you think? He lost $200,000, how do you feel? All right, admittedly, I did trade crypto. [crowd laughing, cheering] Wait a minute, we are… we are shocked. You could have opted into, like, a Roth IRA, you could have put your money into a trust, government bonds. Those pay out so well, in, like, 30 years. You would have been set up for retirement. [crowd booing] All right, sit down. Sit down. This guy’s cucking for JPMorgan on the show, that’s not what we want. I got him up because I thought he was going to be cool and on Molly and shit. And then he’s talking about fucking Roth IRAs. Your husband’s a lot cooler than this fucking guy. I’m telling you right now. He’s not. Will you… Can you… Can you please just weigh in here because you look like a scumbag. Is there any way… Can you please back this guy up? Is there any… I mean, you understand, right? It could have gone up. [Lindsey] Do not do it. I wish I could, I don’t think he has it. I think you got to switch turns. Let her handle the finances. You handle the children, seems you’re more capable of that. What do you… Oh-ho-ho-ho. Wait a minute. [crowd] Oh! Is there anyone who will support this guy? Is there any guy who will? Or woman? No. Yeah. Yeah, stand up. Thank you, guy. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so mu… You look like a character witness in a rape trial. [crowd laughing] I mean, Jesus Christ. [laughs] Hey, it was a tough year. You were trying to do something good for your family. You were trying to make an investment. This is America. And the dream can happen. Listen, Lindsey, American Psycho makes a good point. I mean, even on the way here, I see this fucking hamster, with, like, money popping off of it. And I’m like, “What is that?” Hamster Kombat. Big crypto. What is that? Hamster Kombat. That’s the shit I don’t want to see. Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on. Hamster Kombat? Hamster Kombat. Yes. This sounds kinda badass. [Francesco] It’s pretty good. Wait a minute. Hold on. What… Is it hamsters that kind of fight? No! It’s one hamster. And all it does is… She doesn’t understand. He just hits it and little money signs pop up. No, but I like this. Go on about this. Now… No, no, no, you judgmental cunts. Now, listen to me, this… This is a hamster and what happens? Well, the hamster, it just appears out of thin air, the more you touch it, the more you… the more you click on it, and then it becomes a CEO, -and you can buy a Lambo with the ham… [crowd booing] Lindsey, you see this hamster on the plane, what do you think? Right. I’m like, “Okay, what the hell are you doing?” I’m like, “Turn the phone. Let me see the phone.” “Let me see the phone.” Know what it was? It was… A woodchuck? It was two cartoon women called, “Twerk-something,” and the more you press it, the bigger their butts grow. [crowd laughing, cheering] It’s a mini-game that’s part of Hamster Kombat. So to answer your question, to answer your question, what I would like is to not ever see any of this shit again. Francesco, will you promise to your beautiful pregnant wife right now that you will not play… Mm-hmm. …with hamsters, penguins, apes, or big-butted women? If that’s what it takes to keep you… [crowd jeering] If that’s what it takes… if that… If… If… If it’s my wife or the crypto, I would choose my wife. All right, give them a round of applause. Let’s give them a round of applause. Lindsey, do you accept this? I’ll believe it when I see it. All right. Well, give her a big hug. Give her a big hug and a kiss. Come on. [crowd applauding] [Tim] That’s your hamster right there. That’s your big hamster. [Francesco] I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Lindsey and Francesco, everybody. Give them a round of applause. [crowd cheering] [Tim] Give ’em a round of applause. Thank you guys so much for coming on. Good luck. Francesco, I have some opportunities for you later. We’ll figure it out. We’ll talk. Well, after what we’ve seen here tonight, we can only come to one conclusion. Harvey Weinstein is innocent. [shocked laughter] I’m kidding. I’m kidding. The American people are very sick and there’s not much we can do about it. There’s not enough prisons to house them, and we can’t send them all to fight China. So, what can we do? We can keep feeding them and paying them for sex. Thank you for watching, and register to vote! Good night! [cheering] [upbeat synth music playing] Are you willing to twerk for Kamala? Twerk for Kamala right now. Twerk for Kamala. That’s not twerking. That’s not twerk. That’s horrible. -You say you’re a magician, right? Yeah. So pull the rabbit out of the hat and follow the White Rabbit for the truth. Okay, that was terrible. But the point is this… It was absolutely terrible. Freedom… [crowd] Yeah. [crowd jeering] How… How fucking stupid is the entire… I mean, this is amazing. These women are treating you like a piñata, but you’re allowing it to… That’s… And it’s not because you’re Mexican. It’s not because you’re Mexican. Oh, Mom! So… your boys, you would not manage as much, but if your daughter became a fatty boom-batty, you would… You would get involved? I’d be pretty upset. Maya, are you in a relationship now? I am. And what type of man are you with now? A provider. A generous man. A generous man. Okay. And how old is he? He’s 84. He’s 84. [crowd cheering] He’s 84 years… [crowd whooping] He’s… How creepy are white people? I’m not a gold-digging whore, but I am a size queen, and the fact that you can cross your legs like that, I don’t have the time. [crowd] Oh! Oh! Jose! Jose! I mean… Right? You’re saying he’s got a pussy? Yes. Kill John McCain! Kill John McCain! [all chanting] Kill John McCain! Kill John McCain!'],\n",
              " 'ronny': [\"[tuning] [gentle Hawaiian music playing over radio] [revving] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for Ronny Chieng! [crowd cheering] [upbeat music playing] [crowd continues cheering] [music fades] Thank you. Thank you, Hawaii! I’m turning 38, so I’m harvesting my wife’s eggs this year. I’m harvesting my wife’s eggs so that we can make embryos, so we can freeze the embryos, so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when you’ve given up on your own hopes and dreams. [crowd laughing] I’m still trying here! I look at my friends who are my age who have kids, and they all look like shit. [crowd laughing] It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my Instagram too much. With their fucking haggard faces. Just drooping, wrinkly crow’s-feet-embedded heads. Receding hairlines. Just withering, graying hair coming out in clumps. Because of their children. Like, I did a show, and someone I went to high school with in Singapore came to the show, and after the show, I met up with them, and they brought another person with them, and I was like, “Oh, is this other person your mom?” “Thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show.” And that other person was also someone I went to high school with. [crowd laughing] That’s how fucking ugly… [crowd laughing] …these people have become because of their children. Just unrecognizable. So I’m trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit. And, um, first step of harvesting my wife’s eggs is, I have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks. So, I have to inject my wife. I am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks. Zero medical training. I was given no medical training whatsoever. The government lets you do this. The… The doctor asked me to do it. The doctor was like, “Hey, have you ever held a needle before?” “No? Perfect, here, take this, and inject your wife in the middle of her body, like Nicolas Cage in The Rock.” [crowd laughing] “Twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you.” “Mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes.” “Just trust us that it’s the right thing that you’re injecting into the person you love the most.” Internet chemicals that show up… It comes in a powder! I have to make it into a liquid, you understand? It’s a meth lab in my kitchen as I’m mixing… the comp… I’m sweating the whole time ’cause I’m scared I’ll fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely, then you have to, like… The air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements. And then you have to put it in the syringe. Then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude like you know what you’re doing. [crowd laughing] [scattered applause] I don’t know what I’m doing! I saw someone do this on Doogie Howser. [crowd laughing] [crowd whooping] I don’t even know the angle to put it into her. [chuckling] Like, it looks so painful going in, like… I love my wife so much I can’t even bear to watch her in pain. I couldn’t even bear to watch the needle go into her. I had to inject my wife like this. I had to, like, cover my eyes, and, like, backhand it… [crowd laughing] …into her like Kurosawa. [imitates sword slash] “Did I get the middle of your body?” “No?” “Okay, just walk into the needle!” [crowd laughing] “I’m supposed to do all the work here? Meet me halfway.” And, uh, the doctor said, “If you do everything right, if you… measure correctly, you inject at the right times, they scan, like, this part of her body, you know, that Chicago Bulls logo. Right? And they were like… [crowd laughing] …”If you do everything right, based on what we can tell, you should expect 15 eggs.” [inhales] And my wife ended up getting 26. [scattered whooping and applause] Yeah. Always a… [applause] Yeah, always like a late, half-hearted response to… [crowd laughing] Usually, the women in the crowd are like, “Whoo, yeah.” All the men in the crowd are always like… [crowd laughing] “Is that a good number?” “Is 26 a good number of eggs?” “How many eggs equal one bebe?” “Is it four eggs is one bebe?” “So 26 eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together…” Let me put this in a language that men can understand, okay? Twenty-six eggs from one vagina, in one cycle, is MVP numbers. [crowd laughing] Twenty-six eggs is like, if Magic Johnson averaged the triple-double and killed his own AIDS. [crowd laughing] Okay? That’s the level of medical miracle that’s happening in whatever this part of my wife’s body, that horn of the bull that, like, curls into itself. The doctor, like, scraped out 26 eggs out of my wife’s vagina, like salmon roe. Just scooping out. Just dripping out, and then you put it in some nigiri, right? And then you eat it. That’s how babies are made. You gotta Salt Bae the eggs onto the ikura, and then you eat it. So, uh, we’re trying to make embryos. So, eggs, that’s just half the equation. I don’t know if you know how embryos are made, but eggs, that’s just half of it. She did her part admirably. So now I have to contribute my half of the embryo equation. So I’m sitting in the doctor’s office. [exhales] Like a wet pigeon, all right? And the doctor comes over. And the doctor’s a woman because of course she is. She’s like, “Good morning, Mr. Chieng.” “So, um, when’s the last time you ejaculated?” My wife is right here, and she’s like, “Yeah, when is the last time you ejaculated?” [crowd laughing] “We would all like to know.” It’s the one time in life where you’re not allowed to lie about jerking off. It’s when a medical professional is asking you a direct question. And it’s for reproduction. It’s for the intended purpose, so you gotta tell the truth. So I’m like, “Whatever, I’ll tell the truth.” “Uh, let me check my calendar, uh…” [crowd laughing] “I guess the last time I ejaculated was, um…” “Let me see… Uh, yesterday, around 3:00 p.m.” [crowd laughing] And my wife is like, “Yesterday… I was with you all day.” [crowd laughing] And I was like, “Yeah, but remember when you took out the trash?” [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Because I also put up MVP numbers. Against a shot clock. And heavy defensive pressure. But I was thinking of you the whole time. It’s really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever Vietnamese people eat. My wife is Vietnamese. I’ve no idea what the fuck she eats. Nước mắm. [chuckles] And I went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off. It’s the medical jerking-off room. Every hospital has a medical jerking-off room. Okay? It’s nondescript, not a lot of signage. Smaller than I think it should be. Lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt. And I’m sitting in a medical jerking-off room. By myself. And there’s grown men outside the door, waiting for me to finish… [crowd laughing] …so they, too, can use the medical jerking-off room that we are sharing like a WeWork. [crowd laughing] And I’m in a medical jerking-off room by myself. And… I couldn’t go! Okay? Sorry! Sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand. I’m sorry! Sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me! Sorry! Sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters, as they code to death painfully, and the families crying in the waiting room wasn’t turning me on. [crowd laughing] So I couldn’t go. I couldn’t go. So I just call 911, right? I’m like… [chuckles] [crowd laughing] I’m like, “These people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room.” Uh, I call the doctor back in, and I’m like, “Doc, I can’t go.” “Okay? I can’t medically ejaculate under these circumstances.” “The vibes are off.” “Let me go home. Let me go home to medically ejaculate. Can I do that?” And the doctor’s like, “Yeah, you can go home, but, you know, as soon as it comes out of your body, it expires quicker than avocados in Hawaii, alright?” “You’ve got…” [crowd laughing] “You have, like, a 45-minute window before there’s like an exponential decreasing probability of…” [gibberish] I’m like, “Okay, fine.” “I’ll go home, I’ll medically ejaculate, I’ll come back in 45 minutes, no problem.” So I go home, open the front door, ejaculate immediately. Alright? This is… [crowd laughing] Alright? This is home court advantage. I know where everything is, I know what’s behind me. I look at the dripping garbage bag. [crowd laughing] It’s like a Pavlovian response at this point. Um… I ejaculate into a cup. Okay? It’s a cup that they gave me. It’s not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen. [crowd laughing] That says, “World’s Best Dad” on it. [chuckles] It’s the cup that they use… doctors give you to test your pee for drugs. It’s got a really tight cap, right? So, I ejaculate into the cup. It keeps overflowing, so I gotta keep, like, pouring it out. [crowd laughing] Just overwhelming amounts. [crowd laughing] It’s like Ghostbusters 2 up in here. [crowd laughing] [chuckling] I fill it to the brim, and then I scrape off the top, and then I… And then I seal the cap as tight as I can, right? Get it really nice and tight. And then I… I put it inside my T-shirt, next to my skin, under my armpit. Nice and snug. Because the doctor told me to do that. Because apparently, like the Titanic, your body heat will keep your people alive. And then I run downstairs, and I jump into a New York City taxi, and I’m like, “Take me to Langone Hospital, please. Hurry up.” The taxi driver is like, “What the fuck are you doing with your hand?” “Are you okay?” I’m like, “Oh, yeah, no, I’m fine.” “No, it’s not me. It’s my… my wife. She’s wait… A person… It’s my jizz.” [crowd laughing] And New York City taxis have seen much worse. So, the taxi driver was like, “Oh, okay, cool.” “Thank you for using a cup.” [crowd laughing] “Unlike the last two dudes who were back there.” Just raw dogging at the JFK, you know what I’m saying? And, uh, we get to the… we get to the hospital, right? I open the taxi door. I run into the hospital. And because it’s New York City, someone on the sidewalk is like, “Hey, yo! Hey, yo!” “Were you that guy in Shang-Chi?” [crowd laughing] “Am I… Yes, I was a minor character in the Marvel movie Shang-Chi, not the main guy.” And the guy’s like, “Yo! Yo! Can I get a photo with you?” And I’m like, “Okay, sure.” [crowd laughing] So, we take a photo like this. So, someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger. And I’m doing this. Like Napoleon. If you ever come across this photo, just know I am holding my own jizz. [crowd laughing] So feel free to tag it. [crowd laughing] He was very grateful. He was like, “Aw, thanks so much, man.” And I was like, “No problem, man.” I shake his hand, right? [crowd laughing] Because I love meeting my fans. And I run into the hospital, right? Already hitting the 45-minute mark. End of the fourth quarter. There’s no time left on the clock. So I just take my jizz and I just throw a buzzer-beater. Right? The doctor, like, catches my jizz, like… [crowd laughing] Like Odell Beckham. She just, like, one hand, grabs it, and, like, in the same motion, without even putting it down, she, like, alley-oops my jizz into my wife’s eggs, right? Just takes it, and she goes, “Boom, shaka-laka!” And, uh, my sperm goes into my wife’s eggs, and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg. Nobody knows. It’s a mystery. It’s a mystery of the universe. Nobody knows. When sperm goes into the egg, it’s unknowable. Ooh, it’s… It’s like the event horizon on a black hole. No one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg. Sometimes, nothing happens. When sperm goes into the egg, sometimes, it becomes a bubble tea. [crowd laughing] Nobody knows where bubble tea comes from. It’s “tapioca.” The sperm goes into the egg, and then you shake it, and you go to Vegas, you throw it on the crap table… And if you’re lucky, if you get a good dice roll, right? It becomes a blastocyst. That’s what we call future humans, blastocysts. It becomes embryos. The doctor, she’ll take all the embryos and she’ll look at them under the microscope, and she’ll grade the embryos. Like cocaine. [crowd laughing] She’ll be like, “Ooh, yeah, these ones? These are A-grade embryos right here.” [snorting] [crowd laughing] “These ones, these are… these are B-grade embryos, so… so I don’t know.” [crowd laughing] “These… These ones? These are C-grade embryos…” [grumbles] “Oh, and these ones?” “Yeah, these… these are… These are D-grade embryos.” “Yeah, these… These will storm the Capitol someday.” Alright? So… [crowd laughing] You don’t want that. And then… [crowd cheering] And then you have to, like, draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics. And you don’t know. You’re just projecting data. You just hope you’re not throwing away a Tom Brady in the 12th round that’s going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you can’t measure the human spirit. And, uh, we all like to think we’re good people in this room, but we’re all picking the A-grade embryos, okay? No one here is not picking your A-grade embryos if given a choice. Even if you were a B-grade embryo. [crowd laughing] You would still pick your A-grade embryos. Because you’ll be like, “I know what it’s like.” “I’m not putting my kids through this B-grade human existence, with sweaty palms and sciatica.” [crowd laughing] “Give me the A-grade shit. Give me the best we could do.” “Give my kid a fighting chance.” And it got me thinking about the future a little bit because I never wanted kids. I never thought I would have kids. The only thing I ever wanted to do my whole life was this. Stand-up comedy in America. [crowd cheering] It’s the best. Look at this. It’s the best. You are cheering because you know this is way better than having kids. [crowd laughing] [crowd whooping] So much more fun and lucrative. Well, the blastocysts are real now. There’s eight of them waiting for me in the cloud. Um… 33% chance of successful implantation with grade-A embryos. So, I guess that makes me a mass murderer in Alabama. It got me thinking about the future. What kind of parent am I gonna be? Am I gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were, or am I gonna be better than my parents were? Be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck you’re supposed to be now, and… Thinking about it, turns out I’m gonna be just as bad as my parents were. I can… I can feel it. I can feel it inside me. I can feel the… I can feel the Chinese inside me. I can just feel that high expectation, just low tolerance for excuses. It’s in here. It’s right in here. It’s like the default app. You know, you can’t delete the calculator app. There’s no “X.” When you shake it, there’s no “X.” You can move it off the home screen, but it’s still in the OS, embedded. [crowd laughing] In the operating system, I can feel the Chinese. If my blastocyst was real, if it entered this reality, and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever. “Oh my God, look at this blastocyst.” “Everybody, look. Look at how beautiful this blastocyst is.” “I love you so much, blastocyst.” “I love you much more than I thought I would.” [kisses] And your blastocyst is hugging you back, right, they’re like… [in child’s voice] “I love you too, Daddy.” “Daddy, Daddy.” “When I grow up, I want to be a stand-up comedian.” “Just like you.” [crowd laughing] I just feel the Chinese coming on, right? I just… [crowd laughing] You take your glasses off like Hitler in the bunker. [crowd laughing] “Stand-up comedy? Are you out of your fucking mind?!” [crowd laughing] “That’s not even a real job!” “What do you think is gonna happen?” “Just gonna run around America and tell jokes to strangers who don’t give a fuck about your mental health?” “And even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds, and make it to even a semi-professional level as a stand-up comedian, do you think there’s any chance in hell you’ll be funnier than me?!” [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] “Dad is a borderline arena act in some markets!” “Have you seen my IMDb page?” “I’m in everything! I will fucking crush your career!” Osoto gari! “Your mother and I just spent a fortune to make an A-grade blastocyst for them to become a B-grade comedian.” “I will never watch anything you do.” “Go to law school!” [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Is what my father said to me. [crowd laughing] I do think it’s tough for straight men in 2024 to sincerely look up self-improvement on the internet without five weeks later storming the Capitol, okay? That men’s self-help YouTube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now. Okay? I’m not saying it’s the biggest problem in the world. Clearly. But it is a problem, okay? Because men were genetically predisposed to seek self-improvement. Okay? We’re trying to be better people every day. Believe it or not, women. [crowd laughing] Once we hit a certain age, okay? Usually we die before then. Through suicide or environmental factors. BMX biking, dietary choices… But if you can live long enough as a man, you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective, okay? You start seeking guidance from outside sources. You start looking at watches. Like… Like every man in this room has or will at some point. We’ve all been there. Guys, we’ve all done this. We’ve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives. And we’ve been like, “What a fucking piece of shit.” [crowd laughing] “I fucking hate this loser.” “Look at this loser.” “Fuck this loser. I hate this person.” “I need to be a better person.” “Let me start by getting fit.” [crowd laughing] [woman screams] “Let me work on my health.” “That seems like a logical place to start my journey.” “Let me control what I can control in here.” So what do you do as a man? You go on YouTube, right? You look up how to lift weights. Right? You press “Enter.” You click on the first video. It’s some guy doing kettlebell swings, right? He’ll teach you how to lock your core so you don’t break your fucking spine. And then you do that for two days. You feel pretty good about yourself. [man] Whoo! Right? And on the third day, the same YouTube channel has a new video notification alert, The men are like, “What’s this new video from kettlebell-swinging guy?” “What could he be doing in his new video?” In the video, the kettlebell-swinging guy, he’s doing the new kettlebell exercise. “The lawnmower.” He’s doing that. And then, like 30 seconds into the video, he just, suddenly, just stops. And he looks really sad. And he puts the kettlebell down. And he looks straight into the camera. And he’s like, “Yo, guys, just real talk for a second, all right?” [sniffles] “Kettlebells are great, but I just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind.” [crowd laughing] And all the men watching this are like, “Yeah.” [sniffles] “Yeah, that makes sense.” “That feels right, in here.” “Tell me more, kettlebell-swinging guy.” [crowd laughing] “What other advice do you have for all areas of my life?” “Including my relationships and financial investments.” “Please give me guidance, kettlebell-swinging guy.” So what do you do? You watch his next video on autoplay. Then you watch his next video. Here comes the YouTube algorithm with a suggested video. And here comes another suggested video. And a week later, Jordan Peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men. [crowd laughing] Five weeks later, you’re storming the Capitol dressed like a buffalo. [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] That’s a very realistic sequence of events, by the way. That’s not even an exaggerated timeline. Every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm. We all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that men’s self-help, Andrew Tate masculinity, YouTube self-help algorithm. If you don’t know anyone who lost their mind… [crowd laughing] …you’re the one who lost their mind. You’re currently in an echo chamber of assholes. ‘Cause real friends tell you when you’re losing your mind. It’s very tragic. All these men who are trying to be better people, and they’re seeking guidance. But that YouTube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves. There’s tragedy in that. Like all those people. They were just trying to lift weights. [crowd laughing] They weren’t trying to cause an insurrection. They didn’t even know what that word meant. They were just trying to do this. They’re trying to do this. They didn’t know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis-à-vis their torso, right? Is it 90 degrees or 45 degrees? Like, is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you…? They Googled it one time, and then, five weeks later, you’re taking a shit on Nancy Pelosi’s desk. [crowd laughing] And the US Marshals are garnishing your wages. Because you take one wrong turn, and life moves pretty quick! I’m not saying, as a man, don’t take responsibility for your own actions. Okay? I’m just saying that YouTube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys. It… It sucks men in in a way that I don’t think women understand. It really preys on that men’s need to seek guidance from somewhere. It’s very hard to resist. It just draws… draws you in. That’s why fucking Mark Zuckerberg is trying to MMA fight Elon Musk right now. [crowd laughing] That guy fell for his own algorithm. Do you understand? Mark Zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd. And for, like, 20 years now, he’s just been looking at our data, right? Jerking off every single day. Just looking at our data, jerking off. Money piling up. Billions of dollars. Data. Jerking off. Money, money, jerking off, data. For 20 years, that loop. And who knew after two decades of that, one day, he just looked at so much data, he was like, “Oh shit, oh shit.” He fell into it. Now he’s trying to MMA-fight Elon Musk. That guy jerked off and came on his own face. [crowd laughing] Like, it’s out of control. Zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality. And he invented that shit, and he still fell for it. What hope does the average man in America have? Just walking… Just waddling down the street looking… looking for a taco on his phone. He’s gonna get sucked into his phone. He has no chance. That fucking guy has no chance. Because even the good guys in this room… we’re all, like, on a razor’s edge to being a piece of shit, okay? [crowd laughing] That margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razor-thin. I gotta tell you. If you have the means, every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge. And you know what? An Instagram post could push it either way! [crowd laughing] Okay? It depends on the post. Was it cute animals or was it boobs? [crowd laughing] That’s gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours. I do think, as a society, we need to, uh, do a better job of identifying, like, when we have a disagreement with someone who’s genuinely trying to have a good-faith discussion to reach higher understanding, and who’s just talking shit. We are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit, and we’re not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics. Like, for example, me, right now, I’m just talking shit, okay? [crowd laughing] This is one-way shit-talking. I don’t care about any of your opinions. Do not send me any of them. I do not care. You paid for me. I didn’t pay a cent for any of you, okay? [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shit-talking session. If you don’t like it, take it out on Adam Smith. But if I was having a conversation with someone I disagree with, in good faith, I would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with. That’d be a logical place to start a difficult conversation. For example, MAGA. Make America Great Again. They have a point. America’s not doing so great right now. Right? Our kids’ math scores are down. [crowd laughing] Our children’s science scores are down. When judged according to international metrics, uh, healthcare systems not doing so great. Wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially. There was an implied promise to a generation of Americans that if you do certain things, work hard, go to college, be a good person, you would have certain outcomes. And those outcomes didn’t materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decision-making positions lowered the capital gains tax… [crowd laughing] …so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year. In post-World War II, US leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for National Security by making the US dollar the default international trade currency, which gave America the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a US financial banking system, but consequently increased the value of the US dollar astronomically, which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in America. [inhales deeply] Although the logic at the time… [crowd laughing] …was that Americans were supposed to upskill en masse, away from the menial manufacturing jobs, but everyone here’s too much of a dumbass to stay school, so we just traded domestic manufacturing to Asia and the rest of the world at the expense of working-class families. But if you don’t read enough… [crowd laughing] …it comes out as, “Let’s go, Brandon!” [crowd laughing] And it’s like, you have a point, but you don’t have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didn’t read enough. You gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag. There’s a book behind the word. You gotta keep going. You can go at your own pace, but you gotta finish the required reading. Otherwise, we can’t have a conversation. We’re all catching up to each other. I’m friends with MAGA. I’m friends with the MAGAs. Some of them are my good friends. [man] Whoo! Yeah. Hawaii MAGA. [crowd laughing] The friendliest of all MAGA. [crowd laughing] Aloha MAGA. They’re in Hawaii right now, Making Aloha Great Again. I became friends with them because I filmed two seasons of a TV show in Hawaii, Doogie Kameāloha, on Disney+. [crowd cheering] [applause] MAGA Hawaii welcomed me into their homes. “Ronny, please, come over. Please, we’re having a barbecue.” “We’d love you to meet the family, meet the ohana, please.” “We’d love to have you over.” So gracious. You show up, they’re so warm and welcoming. “Thanks for coming. Take whatever you want.” “There’s some Kalua pork, there’s some loco mocos, hot dogs.” “Hey. Here. Here.” “Touch my gun.” [crowd laughing] “Touch it. Just touch… Just take it.” I’m always like, “I… I don’t want to touch any of these guns, okay?” “I don’t know where they’ve been. I don’t know where they’re going.” “I don’t have time in my schedule to attend depositions.” [crowd laughing] “Just give me the loco moco.” [crowd laughing] Very passionate people, my MAGA friends. And I respect their passion to some extent. I do. They’re like, “I love America. I would die for this country.” And I believe them. I believe they love America, and I believe they would die for this country, which is very admirable. But it’s like, man, you are willing to die for your country. Why aren’t you willing to learn math? [crowd laughing] Also for your country, like… Like, do both for your country. I know you wanna die for your country, but we’re losing the engineering jobs to Asia right now. So if you… We need less people to die for their country. We need more people to do their homework for their country. Like, do your homework for your country. Like, actually sit down and show the work, and, like, do the… That’s a more efficient way to show your patriotism. If you take that “I want to die” energy and you put it into homework, you will fucking top the school, I’m telling you. It’s… Sky’s the limit. [crowd cheering] Dude, you’ll… you’ll solve a lot of problems, you’ll create a lot of jobs, you’ll increase the GDP. Just do… do your homework for your country. “I’d rather die!” [crowd laughing] I… I thought so. I thought that might be… I thought that might be the case. Dying’s easy, math is hard. [crowd laughing] These quadratic equations making me suicidal. Uh, we try not to talk about politics, my MAGA friends and I, out of mutual respect. Inevitably, it comes up. Some stuff I’m wrong about, some stuff they’re right about, but sometimes, like, their messaging is so convoluted. Like, I can’t get to what their core issue actually is, because their surface messaging is so chaotic. Like, sometimes they’re like, “Ronny, China caused COVID, but COVID isn’t real.” [crowd laughing] So, is it fine then? Does it mean it’s fine? I don’t know how to feel about it now. ‘Cause one minus one is zero. I don’t know what to tell you. The… The math analogy works for concepts, not just numbers, you can… “X” is anything. Why are you yelling at me about China? Always yelling at me about China. “China is doing this. China did a weather balloon, with a camera.” “China’s got an artificial island in the Pacific doubling as an aircraft carrier base.” “China’s doing TikTok. Why is China doing TikTok?!” I don’t know. [crowd laughing] I’m not from China. I’m from Malaysia. [scoffs] I’m from Malaysia, not China. I’m… I’m third-generation Chinese Malaysian. Malaysia. You know Michelle Yeoh? Oscar winner? Malaysia? Yeah, that’s Malaysia. Sama-sama. Malaysia. Saya anak Malaysia. Malaysia. Malaysia, not China. Malaysia. We are the ones who lost the plane. [crowd laughing] Okay? You guys remember that? Did you see the documentary on Netflix, suggested after my special? You guys see that? That was us. [crowd laughing] That was us. We’re the “lose the plane” people. Okay? We’re not the human rights whatever… I don’t know… TikTok… I don’t know what that is, okay? We’re the… [mimics plane engine] “Ah! Where is it?! Where the fuck is it?!” That’s us. Uh, my… my MAGA friends all hate US tax. That’s like a universal party platform. There’s different types of MAGA, right? There’s, like, MAGA light, MAGA concentrated, but, like… Right, it’s unfair to group them under one banner, but one uniting party principle is, “Love America, fuck US tax.” And I get it. I also hate US tax now that I’m in the highest bracket. [crowd laughing] Yeah, I’m MAGA with that. Fuck US tax. Yeah, fuck American tax. Feels good to say it. Like the words give you power, right? Fuck US tax. Fuck American Tax. You like it? You like it when I say it? When this fucking foreigner says it? You like that? Fuck US tax. You like that? You like it when this accent says that? Fuck American tax. You like that? You don’t see a discrepancy in energy? “Love America, USA, USA.” “Fuck US tax.” Put politics aside for just three seconds. Okay? If it’s even possible. Just for three seconds, just consider this concept in a vacuum. Just as an academic exercise, okay? When you love something, you give it money. [crowd laughing] Right? Like that’s one of the primary ways we show love for individuals, organizations, ideas on Kickstarter, sports teams… We go like, “Yeah, we give it money.” So when you go, “Love America, USA, USA.” “Fuck US tax.” So what are you saying? You love America so much, you want it to be poor? You want your country to be poor? You want it to be a beggar on the street. A street beggar. You want your country to be a street beggar on the street? I love my mom. Sometimes I give my mom money. [crowd laughing] Give your mom money sometimes. [man] Yeah! Look how alien this concept is to white people. [crowd laughing] [applause] Just… silence. [crowd laughing] Give your mom money sometimes. “For what?!” [crowd laughing] Because she’s your Ma. [chuckles] And you love her, right? She loves you back, so fucking cut her off a piece every once in a while. Probably tore stuff giving birth to you, cut her a piece of the pie. Arbitrarily, even. Just give a… I’m sure your mother would appreciate it. No matter who your mom is, how self-accomplished she is, I’m sure your mom could use it. Fix the driveway, invest in infrastructure. Something. [crowd laughing] Sometimes Americans treat their country the way they treat their parents. [indistinct chatter from crowd] Yeah. [crowd laughing] “I love my mom. I love my mom. I would die for my mom.” “But fuck her, she made her choices.” [crowd laughing] I love being in America. I do. I love being here. I had my options. I came here. I love being in America because this is the country that puts show business above everything. And I am in the business of show business. So naturally, I’m gonna come here and do it. I do this in America, “Fuck America. Fuck the president. Fuck US tax,” money, money just comes into… [crowd laughing] “Fuck the president.” “He’s too old. Fuck this president.” The money comes in. Money just comes in. Like printing money. I do this in Malaysia, same… same words, same… same clothing, same haircut, facing the same direction, in Malaysia? Jail. [crowd laughing] Like, the arbitrage value is out of control. Same product in different loc… Obviously, I’ll do this here. Why the fuck would I do it anywhere else? It’s the best. I think, uh, sometimes people forget I’m a first-generation immigrant here. Because my second-generation or later American friends, like, their parents were immigrants. And the way they talk about their parents is so disrespectful. And they forget, like, I’m also an immigrant. They’ll be like, “You know my parents? They’re immigrants.” “You know immigrants. They’re so cheap.” [crowd laughing] Like, “Don’t come over. My family’s over this weekend. My parents are here.” “My parents are immigrants. You know immigrants. Ugh!” “They’re so cheap.” Yo, I want to defend immigrants here for a second, all right? Fuck that shit. Yeah, my mom lives in Singapore. She is not an immigrant. She is still extremely cheap. [crowd laughing] Okay? Being cheap is not an immigrant thing. It’s genetic. [crowd laughing] Cheap people are cheap. They’re not choosing to be cheap. It’s just inside, it’s not a choice. Chinese baby boomers are cheap ’cause they don’t know how to have fun. They haven’t had fun in, like, 50 years. They, like, forgot the energy of fun. Like, of all the Asians right now in the Asian fun hierarchy, from most fun to least fun, Chinese baby boomers, least fun of all the Asians right now. I can say this. I’m Chinese, okay? You don’t fucking say it. [crowd laughing] This is our “N” word. You don’t fucking say it. I say it. You don’t fucking say it. Least fun… You don’t fucking say it. Least fun of all the Asians, Chinese baby boomers. Right now, of all the Asians, most fun Asians, uh, the Koreans, okay? You gotta give it up for the Koreans. [crowd cheering] [crowd laughing] Give it up for the Koreans. You gotta tip your cap and respect the back-to-back championships of the modern-day Koreans just killing it with the fun and the pop culture. They’re… Everyone’s… They’ve got Blackpink. They got music. They got BTS. [crowd cheering] Dude, BTS is right now in the army fighting Kim Jong-un. [crowd laughing] Do you understand? BTS is at the DMZ right now, just going… [singsongs pop beat playfully] [mimics machine gun] [crowd laughing] Just an unstoppable force of entertainment. [chuckling] Taking down countries and dictatorships. They got, uh… Koreans got, uh, the Parasite movie, Oscar-winning. They got Past Lives. They got, uh… Crash Landing on You. [crowd cheering] Just dominating the Netflix home page of white people. [crowd laughing] Never thought I’d see the day when white people’s homepage is full of K-drama. Just binging. Non-stop. They got, uh, Squid Game. Dude, Koreans have more fun dying in Squid Game than Chinese people have at comedy shows. Chinese people at comedy shows, they’re looking at their phone. “Do I have to look up?” “He’s here? Okay, I’m gonna video for six minutes.” Full flash video. This is… This is how I live in the moment as a Chinese person. Koreans, most fun. Uh, Filipinos know how to have fun. [crowd cheering] Yeah, they love having fun, uh… Vietnamese people know how to have fun. Cambodians know how to have fun. Hmong people know how to have fun. Even Japanese know how to have fun. In a reserved way. [crowd cheering] Outwardly stoic. Inside, just anime. [crowd laughing] Outside, unreadable. Inside, just the intro to Sailor Moon. Right? Just… [crowd laughing] [humming the intro to Sailor Moon] Outside is just, “Ohayo gozaimasu.” [crowd laughing] Japanese people have so much fun sometimes they go straight back to work. [crowd laughing] “You’re not gonna change your suit? Just straight into the office? Alright.” [chuckles] Uh… Everyone knows Chinese baby boomers, least fun of all the Asians. Because for Chinese baby boomers, their primary directive in life is, “Do not get scammed.” That’s like the overriding directive that informs the entire decision-making tree. RoboCop, primary directive, “Do not get scammed.” “Do not arrest OCP executive.” “Do not get scammed.” And for Chinese baby boomers, there’s no value proposition, okay? It’s just pure price sensitivity. That means any money outgoing is a scam. [crowd laughing] “If money leaves my possession, that was a scam!” [crowd laughing] So the whole time, they’re just tensed up, they’re just looking for scams when they go out. They’re just like… They can’t even relax. “Scam’s coming!” It’ll be a two-drink minimum over here. Parking guys, tip… [grumbling] Tensing up. Meanwhile, Koreans in the back just having fun. [crowd laughing] Filipinos dancing like… Chinese baby boomers just tensed up. The further they get from their house, as distance X increases, they know the fees will increase and so the ex… The expenditures are gonna increase, so they keep tensing up. The further they get, until eventually, like, their whole body tenses up into, like, a “C,” right? Like a “C” for Chinese. [crowd laughing] And then, in the back you’re like, “Go, go, have fun! Have fun!” They just refuse to have fun. Like, my mom came and visited me in New York City. Her only son, she came to New York City. New York City is the kind of city where, as soon as you open your front door, it’s like $1.50. Like, if you touch your door knob, it’s like, Apple Pay $1.50, just going… It goes into the universe. My mom came in and approached the front door in New York. She’s like in the back of the apartment, “I’m good, I don’t need to leave the house today.” My mom isn’t even scared of Asian hate. She’s more scared of inflation. [crowd laughing] She can’t believe the prices of things anymore. You take her out to Central Park. “Let’s go to Central Park, it’s free.” “Look how beautiful New York is in autumn. Look at this.” “Why are these hot dogs five dollars? It’s like, “No, this…” “The price is right. No one is scamming you.” “That’s the correct amount of money to pay for that.” “You haven’t been out of the house in 50 years. That number is correct.” “That’s how much things cost after baby boomers destroyed the global financial economy in 2010 pursuing subprime mortgages, okay?” That’s… That’s… If anything, you scammed yourself. That’s you scamming yourself. Yeah, “You played yourself.” DJ Khaled. [crowd laughing] My mom came to visit me in Hawaii. Her first time in Hawaii. And if you know Hawaii, locals and the Hawaiians here, the least scammy culture on the planet. Could not be more generous as a community. You get so much more than you give when you’re on the islands of Hawaii. And, uh, my mom comes, and she lands, and she gets to the hotel, and they welcome her, “Aloha. Welcome to Hawaii.” And they put a lei over her, like a ring of flowers. They put it over her, and my mom does this. [crowd laughing] “I’m not paying for that.” [crowd laughing] And I’m like, “You can’t do that, Mom.” “They’re not trying to trick you into buying something.” “They’re trying to welcome you to their homeland.” “They’re not tricking you into buying just ’cause you touched it.” “This isn’t Thailand. Just put on…” [crowd laughing] “Put on the lei, you’re embarrassing me in front of the Hawaiians!” Mahalo. [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] These Chinese baby boomers, most scared of being scammed in real life, the first to get scammed on the internet. For people who live in fear their entire lives, extremely gullible. Because these baby boomers, they don’t have the… they don’t have the antibodies to deal with the internet. Completely clueless when they go on now. Like, watching baby boomers go on the internet now is like watching babies wandering into the kitchen by themselves, just looking for cookies on the kitchen countertop, just like… Running their hands blindly on the kitchen countertop. Pulling down knives. Kitchen knives coming straight down into their eyeballs, into, like, the soft part of their skull. They go in the kitchen, they open the oven, they turn it on. They stick their head inside. They’re like, “Any pictures of my grandkids in here?” “Is this link safe to click on? Is this link safe to click on?” “Is this link safe to click on?” Just falling for every basic bitch internet scam possible. These fucking baby boomers tumbling into internet scams like pandas rolling down a hill. [crowd laughing] Just jujitsu-rolling into scams every single day. Loving scams. “Oh, what do you want? 20 Target gift cards?” “Yeah, sounds like a legitimate way to pay for antivirus software on my phone.” “Everybody, look. Look at this link. Look, there’s a…” “‘What’s the one trick your doctor doesn’t want you to know?'” “Okay, I’ll click on that link.” “I knew it. I knew my doctor was scamming me!” “That was a trick he didn’t want me to know.” “I’m gonna invalidate his medical degree with one click right now!” [grunts] “This is not the scam. My doctor is the scam. Let me…” [grunts] Click on this… These fucking internet idiot savants who can’t remember a single goddamn password, but for some reason, can make any piece of misinformation go viral. Like a Russian cyber army, just spreading misinformation around the world in family group WhatsApp chats. Everywhere. “Everybody, just look at this article. Is this real?” “Look at it. Is this real?” It’s how they fact-check! They spread it. “Look at this, this is a real…? Everybody, weigh in.” “I’m not saying a hair dryer in your mouth will kill COVID.” “Okay? But what? You can’t ask questions anymore?” “Look at this article from cnn-n-n-n.ru.” “Quick, send it to your uncle, send it to your…” “Send it to our whole family tree. Everybody needs to see this.” Has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet? I get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last, due to the exponential technology growth curve, okay? But this has got to be the biggest gap in human history! The information asymmetry right now is just out of control. You literally have people in Honolulu right now auto-driving their Tesla Cybertrucks as they vape out the window, and their phone AI is trading cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, you have baby boomers, they can’t even right-click. [crowd laughing] They can’t even right-click. “There’s one button! How do you right-click on one button?!” It’s scary. They don’t know what’s real anymore. “Hey, Ronny. Look at this photo of Bigfoot shopping at Whole Foods.” [crowd laughing] “Bigfoot is real now!” “Look, there’s an image of him buying kombucha at Whole Foods.” “What technology exists that can fake images?” I’m like, “Mom, that’s not real. Stop sending it around. It’s not real.” “How do you know?” They always get so indignant about it. Like, “How do you know that it’s not real?” “How did you know that?” Because the font, the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry, and that lighting state doesn’t make sense for that image! And that’s not standard dimensions for a news article. I can’t give you this knowledge. It’s like Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink! I’ve seen so much shit on the internet, my brain instantly filters it. You’ll never have this skill set, so just stay off the internet! This world is not for you anymore! Stop making decisions! [crowd cheering and clapping] But anyway, respect your elders. [crowd laughing] It’s a Confucian value. Maybe if you give your mom some money, she wouldn’t get scammed so much. Yeah, well… Think about the correlation between those two phenomena. Uh… People always ask me, like, “Why do you shit on your mom for money?” “Why don’t you shit on your dad for money?” Alright, uh… [chuckles] No, I don’t talk about my dad because, uh, my dad has no context for show business. Like, we grew up in Malaysia. Like, his families are rubber tappers in Malaysia. My aunts and uncles are still in Sitiawan in Malaysia right now tapping rubber. They have no context for show business. Very smart people, but they don’t know this world. My dad, he was the first guy in his family to get a college education. He went to Manchester College, which has merged with the University of Southern New Hampshire. He got his master’s of economics there. Put himself through it. Very smart guy. And he was a good immigrant. He came to America, to New Hampshire, to get his education, and when he graduated, he went back to Malaysia. He didn’t take anyone’s job, he left. [crowd laughing] And my dad had the vision to see what I didn’t see. He knew he had a ceiling on him, because of the way he thinks and talks, and he went back to Malaysia. And he was right! For him. He went back. It was the right choice for him. He became a very successful corporate executive. Uh, he retired to a farm in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Love farming. He retired to a farm. That’s how much this guy loved it, but he had no context for show business, so he wouldn’t understand anything I’m doing. Like, he wouldn’t understand what I’m doing in Godzilla vs. Kong. He’d be like, “Why don’t you just run that way?” [crowd laughing] “Dad, I don’t control the edit. Okay?” “I’m just Honolulu Chinatown shopkeeper No. 3 in this…” “In this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla, okay?” “I’m just connecting Act 1 to Act 2, I don’t have a say in how this plays out.” Because of that, I stopped telling him about what I was doing. I felt he wouldn’t get it, and he stopped asking me. So I didn’t tell him I got hired on The Daily Show. He found out the way all parents find out about their kids’ accolades, through a local newspaper. So, one day, the local paper reported that I got hired on The Daily Show, and he called me immediately. He was like, Ronny, what’s this I hear about you joining “The Everyday Show”? And I was like, “Oh no, it’s The Daily Show.” “I joined like two years ago, Dad.” He was like, “Oh, okay. Well, what’s The Daily Show?” I’m like, “It’s just like another late-night American talk show.” “They kind of invented modern American satire.” And… [clicks tongue] And, uh, my dad was like, “Oh, that’s cool. Are you the host?” I’m like, “No, I’m a correspondent.” He was like, “What is that? What’s a correspondent?” I’m like, “Yeah, correspondent is, I help the host with comedy segments.” And he was like, “Oh, okay.” “Hey, Mei! He’s just a sidekick.” [crowd laughing] And so he had, like, no context for what was a win, what was a milestone in this industry. And so, I stopped telling him, and he stopped asking me. And I didn’t need that from him. We… We were totally fine. We’d talk about other stuff. Not about work. We weren’t fighting. It was all good. Uh, and he passed away very suddenly, uh, in 2018. He died on Christmas Eve. Died on his farm, like, no warning, no explanation. He just left one day. He left so suddenly, we had to go back to handle his estate. If anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position, when you have to handle someone else’s estate, it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life. And so it’s me, my wife, my sister, brother-in-law, went back to Johor Bahru, and part of me trying to figure out his estate was I had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using. So, his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it, and I opened it up, and it’s password-protected, and I know this guy so well, I’m like, “His password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child.” So… [crowd laughing] …I type in my sister’s birthday, and spot on. Spot on. It was my sister’s birthday. [crowd laughing] As it should be. She’s, like, an anesthesiologist in Australia. She’s like way more respectable person than me, actually saving lives like a good person. Contributing back to society, not like this fucking asshole. I get in… [chuckles] I get in trouble on the internet for shit I said two years ago, every six weeks. So it should be her. She should be the favorite. So, I log into his computer, I open his web browser, I look at his browsing history, and the whole time, I’m like, “Please don’t let me find my dad’s porn.” “Please don’t let me find what positions my dad was into.” “Even if it was just missionary, I wouldn’t be able to handle it.” “I’m gonna have to burn this laptop.” For real Chinese people, when we burn things, it goes to our ancestors, and then my granddad is gonna see it, and it’s like, I don’t… I don’t want that for them. I’ll be fine, but they’re gonna have an awkward time. I’m considerate like that, uh… So I open the web browser, look at his history, and way to go, Dad, no porn. What a clean-cut guy. No porn. He only went on the internet twice a day. Like clockwork. 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Like the farmer that he was. And every time he went on the internet, he’d only go to two websites each time. So, the first website he’d go to was a local news website, and the second website he’d go to twice a day, every single day, was my Twitter page. [crowd] Aw… So, he’d be reloading my Twitter page twice a day just to see what I was doing. And I post stuff like, “Hey, Honolulu, Hawaii, I sold out five shows, uh, this week, why’s there so many homeless people here?” I’d post stuff like that. [crowd laughing] And, uh… he would read that, and then he’d be like… I assume, he’d be like, “Oh, Ronny’s doing okay.” “He’s in Hawaii, he sold out some shows, and oh, I guess there’s a lot of homeless people in Hawaii.” Uh, and, um, that was his quiet way of keeping up with me. He never told me that, and I never knew that, and we never discussed it, um, which is a very nice sentiment. Unfortunately, uh, as best as I can tell, this is the last tweet my dad read of mine. [crowd laughing] So, as best as I can tell, forensically, based on internet browsing timestamps, the last tweet my dad read of mine, and quite possibly, the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm, was me posting on Twitter, “If you’re a baby boomer on Twitter, I already know you’re a fucking loser.” [crowd laughing] Now, obviously, this was not directed towards him. I didn’t even know he had Twitter. I didn’t even know he knew what Twitter was. But I stand by the statement. [crowd laughing] [applause] And I know that’s kind of a weird way to end the show, but, um… [crowd laughing] [chuckles] …if it’s any solace, uh, this was his phone when he died. [crowd] Aw! That was his, uh, wallpaper and his screensaver. And… [chuckles] And I didn’t even know. And it’s a photo of me and my wife, and we’re in Hawaii. And I’m wearing two leis ’cause my mom threw one off and I put it on. [crowd laughing] And, uh, I didn’t know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper. Uh, and… [applause] Uh… I… I like to… I like to think that, uh, that is the last image he saw of me. That’s what he remembered me by when he left. And, uh, I also would like to tell my sister, I won! [crowd laughing] I won! It was me! It was me! You guys have been great. Thanks for coming out, Honolulu.

              " 'paul': [\"Paul Reiser’s stand-up special is a humorous reflection on aging, marriage, and the absurdities of everyday life. With sharp wit and self-deprecating humor, he explores topics like memory lapses, accumulating life’s clutter, the dynamics of long-term relationships, and the unexpected challenges of getting older. He jokes about the quirks of parenting, the decline of physical abilities, and communication mishaps with his wife, all while highlighting the universal truth that life, like rice pudding, always comes with a few unwanted raisins. Through it all, Reiser maintains a warm, relatable tone, reminding us to embrace the imperfections and humor in the journey. * * * ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Reiser. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Well… Thank you. And let me just say, you’re not wrong. It is great to see me. It is. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So nice to be here in this beautiful theater in your beautiful city. I am so glad… I have so many things to tell you. None of which are important. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] I just want to establish that up front. Manage those expectations. Nothing said tonight will have any political, social or cultural relevance whatsoever. Just so we’re clear. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Nothing. None of that. In fact, I’d go so far as to say no redeeming value, frankly. So, if you leave tonight going, “You know, he really got me thinking,” that’s on you, okay? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But I am very excited. We we have cameras. We’re taping a special. How about that? Isn’t that exciting? [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Very exciting. Yeah, I have not done one in a while. It has been a while. You know, a lot of my friends… You see comedians, and they have a new special every 12 months, every 18 months. Not me. Last one I did, 1991, okay? [AUDIENCE CHEERING] That’s right. Yeah, I like to space them out, you know? Every 32 years, like clockwork, I send another one down the chute so as to not overstay my welcome. Yeah, every 32 years. So the next one after this, if my math is correct, I’m gonna be 97, so… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Yeah. I don’t know how funny I’ll be at 97. So let’s enjoy tonight, shall we? See, a lot of people… A lot of people lie about their age, and they like to pretend they’re younger than they actually are. Which I don’t understand. Maybe some of you are doing it right now. I don’t get it. Because, first of all, you’re not fooling anybody, okay? But even if you do, you’re not really helping yourself because people can see you. So while you’re lying, they’re looking at you, and very often, what you’re saying doesn’t line up with what they’re seeing. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] For example… Let’s say… Let’s say I was very convincing, and I told you I was 35. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] Okay. Your next thought would have to be, “You don’t look good.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “That’s a tired-ass-looking 35-year-old. That’s…” Right. But if I told you I was 89, you’d go, “God bless. He looks great for 89.” So if you’re gonna lie, go that way. That’s what I say. But I’ve never understood. I have a friend who does this. He lies about his age to me. I grew up with the guy, okay? [AUDIENCE TITTERS] So I know how old he is. We were 10 together. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] We were 20 together and we were 30 together, and that’s the last time it lined up. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] Right around there, he just got off the clock. He likes to pretend the last three decades never happened. He just lives in a fairy… And it’s embarrassing. We go out to dinner, and he’s… He’s flirting with every cute waitress. “How are you doing, darling?” I go, “What are you doing? Jackass, what are you doing?” [AUDIENCE TITTERS] He said, “No, I’m not gonna do anything. “I just… I just want to see if I still got it.” And I tell him, “You don’t. You don’t.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Just ask me. You don’t have it. Don’t put her through that. There’s no call for that.” [AUDIENCE TITTERS] “You don’t have it. “1982 was the last time we had it. We don’t have it.” [AUDIENCE TITTERS] “It is no longer had by us.” I said, “What do you think is gonna happen? “Let’s compare and contrast, shall we?” I said, “She’s a beautiful young woman. “Has her whole life ahead of her. “Whereas you “are overweight, pasty and knocking on death’s door. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] “So what do you imagine she would find appealing about you? “The fact that you smell vaguely like her grandfather? Is that what you want?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] He said, “No. I had to talk to her.” He said, “I had to talk to her because she’s so cute.” “I had to talk to her.” I said, “No, you don’t have to.” I said, “You can appreciate something “without getting personally involved. “It’s like a beautiful sunset. “I see that it’s beautiful, but I’m not trying to hump it. Do you see what I’m saying?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You know, the crazy thing about the aging thing, we all have older people in our lives. All right, so we see what happens to them. So we think we have a pretty good idea of what to expect when we get older. But no… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …there are surprises. Things they don’t tell you. Here’s one I didn’t see coming. Sleep. When did that become a challenge? Sleep? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Are you kidding? My whole life, I slept. I didn’t even think about it. Put my head down, I’m sleeping, that’s all. Now I’ve lost the gift. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I don’t know what’s happening. I just know, every morning, first words out of my mouth, “Yeah, I didn’t sleep so good last night.” I mean… Like, every day. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Here’s another thing that I didn’t see coming. As you get older, do you find you get hurt in ways you didn’t used to get hurt. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] I injured myself doing something stupid. Which, by the way, that is the number one cause of injury in this country, is doing something stupid. You ask anybody how they got hurt, I guarantee you the first thing they’ll tell you, “Yeah, it was so stupid.” It’s like, “Yeah, of course.” Right? Because nobody gets hurt doing anything smart. You’ve never heard of that. “I was working on algorithms for the space program, “and my brain just caved in, “and that’s why I look like this. I was so smart.” No, it’s always stupid. It’s always something stupid. “Yeah, I was climbing a ladder in flip flops.” “Okay, well, that’s not smart.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Yeah, no, I was boiling pasta naked.” “Okay, why? Why would you do that?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That’s the whole purpose behind pants. There’s no reason for that. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] My injury was stupid, but I learned something, and I’ll share it with you. Here’s what I learned, folks. At a certain age, don’t help anybody move a couch. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You just leave it or get a young person. There’s no reason for you to get involved. I didn’t even think about it. My friend said, “You wanna grab that? “We want to scooch it back.” So I lift, and just as I lift it, I heard a pop in my arm. I said, “Whoa, that’s not good.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] There shouldn’t be noise in my shirt. Anybody hear that? [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] It really hurt. But then 10 seconds later, it didn’t hurt. So I thought, “Well, maybe I just dodged a bullet.” You know, “Maybe I tweaked it.” No. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] The next morning, I look down, things have moved. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] The whole… The muscle… It’s not like a big muscle. I’m not trying to show off. I’m just saying, whatever sad, pathetic muscle I had, fell. It just fell. So instead of being like a gradual little mound, it was a puny hill gathered at the bottom. It was just… It didn’t hurt, but it looked wrong. So I said, “I’ve got to get this fixed.” So I had to find a surgeon. Orthopedic surgeon. My friend says, “I got the guy for you. “I got the guy. I got the guy. Don’t even look around.” He said, “I got the guy, my guy, I got the best guy. “My guy is the best.” Do you ever notice, all your friends always have the best guy. Nobody has the seventh best dentist. You’ve never heard that. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I have the 35th best proctologist.” No, they’re all the best. They can’t all be the best. Like my regular doctor, my checkup guy, he’s not the best. I know that. He’s… And I’m fine with it. He’s okay. He’s like… He’s in the top 20 in his building, I would imagine. You know, he’s fine. He’s fine. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] He’s is not a particularly great doctor, but he’s got terrific parking, and I love that. The in and out of there. But my friend said, “No, you got to go. “He’s great, he’s great. You’re gonna love him.” And he kept selling. I said, “I’m going.” He said, “No, you’ll love him.” “He’s a great guy, great guy. He’s very thorough. Great guy, great guy.” And then he says, “And he’s really handsome.” I’m like, “Okay.” It’s not something I generally look for when choosing a medical practitioner, but whatever. Okay. So I go. They put me in a little examination room, and I’m there 10 minutes by myself. Door opens, doctor walks in, Guy was really handsome. I’m not gonna lie to you. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Even with my friend’s warning, I was still a little thrown. Like, “Whoa, look at you.” “Hang on, look at you. That’s a good-looking guy. “Look at this guy with a square jaw and a full head of hair. “That’s a good-looking guy.” It struck me, “That shouldn’t be.” If you’re already the top surgeon in the country, you don’t get to be good-looking, too. That’s not right. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Pick one or the other. That’s not how this works. Pick one or the other. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] It’s like sometimes, you meet somebody and they’re really attractive, and then they turn out to be stupid. You go, “Fair enough. Okay.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Pick one. But this guy, he was great. He was very thorough. He did an MRI, did an X-ray. He said, “You know, well, you did some damage.” He said, he goes, “You have a little tear in your rotator cuff.” He said, “But that’s not your big problem.” He said, “Your big problem…” I said, “I know, I’m emotionally unavailable.” He said… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Perhaps it’s not my area. He said, “Your your big problem,” get ready, he said, “Your bicep is partially detached.” I said, “Hang on, Doc, I gotta throw up a little bit.” [GAGS] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I said, “Why would you say that?” He goes, “I see it all the time.” I said, “All right, so what do we do now? A little surgery?” He says, “Well, you can, “but you don’t have to.” I said, “What does that mean?” He said, “Well, the best I can do is I’m gonna bring you back “to where you were before you hurt yourself.” He said, “But you’re telling me you can do everything.” I said, “Yeah, I’ve got full range of motion.” He says, “All right, and you’re not in any pain?” I said, “No, there’s no pain.” And he says, “Yeah, so, “I would just leave it.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I said is, “Is that where I’m at? “Are we already there? Is that what’s happening?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “We’re just gonna run down the clock now? “Is that what we’re doing?” [LAUGHING] “Just leave it.” Oh, my God. If I was real estate, I’m not even a fixer-upper, I’m a tear-down. Just stick it out as long as you can, but I wouldn’t put more money into it at this point. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] He said, “I can hear you when you say that.” [AUDIENCE TITTERS] I said, “No, we’re gonna do the surgery, Dr. Handsome, “and I’ll tell you why.” I said, “We’re gonna do it, because if we don’t, “I think that sends the wrong message “to all the other parts that are still working.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I mean, they see a tendon float by, they go, “Look at this. He doesn’t even give a shit anymore. “The whole place is falling apart. “Why should we pump blood to his heart? “He’s not gonna be around,” you know. So I did the surgery, and I’m happy to report that after months of rehab and thousands of dollars, he was able to make me exactly as weak as I was right before. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So there you go. That’s right. [AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING] Thank you for applauding my slow demise. But I have much to be grateful for. I have my health, such as it is, and I have my family, I have… A little bit about myself, my wife and I, we have two boys, one of whom I don’t care for. And I’m just… To be honest. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I’m just being honest with you. You know, I love him. Don’t get me wrong. I love him, but you know… You know how some kids, they just know how to push your buttons, and they just know how to say the wrong thing. So my younger son, he’s 23. Twenty-four, if we pick up the option, and I don’t know that we will. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But he’ll just come over and he’ll go, “Dad, can I say something to you, no offense?” And I go, “I doubt it.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “That has not been my experience with you thus far.” Right, because nobody ever says, “No offense” unless they’re about to offend you. They just let you know it’s coming, and they don’t care. They don’t care. It’s like when people say, “You know, I don’t want to sound racist…” “Well, then stop talking. Why don’t you stop right there? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Just don’t say it. “Don’t say it, because even you have a hunch “it’s not good, don’t you? Yeah. “So maybe don’t say it. “Because if you say it, “I’ll have to think you’re a racist. No offense.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] No offence. I mean, you know… No, listen, we all want to be terrific parents. We want… We aspire to be great parents. But if we’re being honest, we’re all winging it. We don’t know what the hell we’re doing. None of us know what… But if there’s one skill… If there’s one skill that you need to be an efficient parent, you have to worry. That’s the main thing. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You have to worry. I don’t judge anybody, but if you have kids and you’re not worried, I don’t think you’re doing it right. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You have to worry. I’m not saying do anything, but just worry. Start there. It’s an important skill to have. And not to brag, I’m very good at it. I’m very good at worrying. Even if there’s nothing to worry about, I’ll make something up. I don’t care. I do. I’ll lie in bed, make up lists, come up with lists like “Ways to get hurt “I had not thought of previously.” [AUDIENCE TITTERS] And by way, all the things I worry about, They never happen. They never happen. Nobody’s ever gotten their head stuck in a lawnmower. Okay, but I thought of it. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It could have happened. Nobody ever reached into a dryer to pull out socks, fell in and ended up drying to death. That’s not the thing. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You know, and I’ve been around long enough to know that worrying, it doesn’t help. It doesn’t prevent anything, right? It doesn’t even… It doesn’t even prepare us for anything. But still, we prepare. I know I prepare. If I’m on a plane and we hit a little turbulence, you know, the five seconds where you think you’re going down, I prepare by doing this. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Because this is really all the insulation you need upon impact. This is… That way, if the plane does go down and I’m the sole survivor, I can tell everybody, “You know what kept me alive. “I had my fists balled up very, very tight. “And to be honest, my asshole was clenched shut… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “…like a bank vault on a Sunday.” That puppy was closed for business. Nobody getting in or out of there. That was closed. “So when we hit, I just bounced right up. “That’s what happened. There I was. “I’m the only one. We hit a… Pow. Bounced right up. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I was saved by the grace of God and just the the sheer rigidity of my own sphincter. That’s what did it. Pow. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I told you this would not be important, didn’t I? [LAUGHING] It has been a crazy year. Well, for everybody. But let’s, let’s focus on me. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] A lot of upheaval in my family. We moved. We moved this year, and the kids found us. That was surprising. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I did not anticipate that kind of follow-through. No, we moved. It was a big deal for the kids because we had been in this house for 20 years. So their whole childhood was in this house. And here’s what I learned. You know, you cannot sell your house until you fix it up. Did you know that? [AUDIENCE TITTERS] Because nobody in their right minds is gonna buy your house after what you and the kids have done to the place, living like animals all these years. No, new people deserve better, don’t they? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] All the things that never bothered you enough to fix while you lived there, you’re gonna snap to it for these next imaginary people so they shouldn’t have to live like monkeys in a pile of their own filth. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] So we got to work. We steamed the furniture, cleaned the carpets, painted the walls outside, new shrubs, new hedges, new grass, new flowers. Suddenly, I looked around and went, “This place looks great. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] “Boy, I wish we lived here. This is…” [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] I’ll tell you, it’s not until you move and you start opening cabinets and closets, it’s not until then that you realize just how much crap… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …you have accumulated. You shouldn’t have to move just to get rid of crap. You know, we could, theoretically, get rid of a little crap every once in a while, and whittle it down. But that’s not the way crap works. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] No, crap likes to stay out of sight where it grows in the dark. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] Just as your family has grown over the years, so has your crap. That’s kind of… If you think about it, it’s kind of the arc of life. First half of life, we’re just getting stuff, get stuff. You can’t get enough stuff. Get stuff. Get to a certain age, get rid of that stuff, get rid of that stuff, get rid… That’s the roller coaster of life. Accumulate, shed. Accumulate, and then shed. We accumulate things and people. We accumulate people. When you’re young, you can’t meet enough people. Right? You mean a nice couple, “We should get their number. I like them. “We should be friends with them. “And their other friends, I like them, too. Get their number. “We’ll all get together. The six of us, we’ll have dinner. “And if that goes well, we’ll get an RV, “I think we’ll all go cross country. “I think… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I have a good feeling about these people.” You can’t get enough. And then you get to a certain age, you go the other way. All these people that you were so eager to meet, Now, “You know what? I don’t want to see these people anymore. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I’m tired of these people. I can’t do it. “I’m tired of these people. Should we get new people? “No, I’m saying, no more people. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “No more people. That’s what I’m saying. “No more people. Just you and me. “That’s how it’s gonna be. Just you and me. “And frankly, some days, I would whittle that list down further. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Let’s let’s try you and me.” We all have too many friends. How many friends do you need, really? Three? I’m gonna say three. If you have three good friends, consider yourself blessed. And the others, cut ’em. Just let ’em go. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It’s just too much work. You know, everything, you have to reciprocate. “Oh, they invited us, now we gotta invite them. “They sent us a thing, “all right, we gotta send them a thing. Just cut ’em. And, by the way, they’ll thank you. They were gonna cut you, just so you understand. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So it’s a win-win. But don’t cut them all. You need three. You definitely need three, and I’ll tell you why. Friends do serve a certain function, so you need one friend… You need one friend just to agree with you how horrible the other friends are. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That’s one. Then you need one friend… This is really important. You need one friend whose children are more troubled than yours. That’s so important. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You’ve got to find that family. It’s not nice… I’m not saying… But it’s so important, ’cause you just feel better about yourself, don’t you? “You know what, honey? Our kids are lazy and stupid.” “Yeah, okay. But that kid’s out of his fucking mind. “That kid’s a nut. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “That kid’s nuts. “Oh, those poor people. “Yes, we should count our blessings “with these two idiots because that’s… “That’s no way to live.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So that’s two. And then the third, in case once in a while, you need a ride to the airport. But that’s like… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And the rest, cut ’em. Cut ’em. You don’t need ’em. But that’s what this point in life is about. Just shed, shed. We accumulate, and then we shed. There’s a third stage. Very tiny, short, brief stage at the top of that curve, when you have just the right number of people, just the right number of things, but you don’t know it. You don’t know it till you go past it. Amazon drops off some crap you didn’t even know you ordered, and you’re going, “What is this, sweetie? An avocado pit remover. “Why? Why?” “We’ll be having difficulty removing the pits from the avocado.” You don’t want it, but you have it, so you throw it in the drawer, and that’s what breaks you. A week later, you put your house on the market. That’s why one piece of crap too many. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And then it’s time to downsize. So now how do you get rid of your crap? I’m gonna tell you. Three piles. That’s the answer. Everything you have goes into one of three piles. Garbage pile, save pile, and then the biggest one, not sure pile. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And that’s the Holy Trinity of downsizing. Garbage, save, not sure. Now start with the garbage pile, and you’ll notice you’ve got a problem, because not everything in the garbage pile is actually garbage. Some of it still works. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Those are the two words that have kept this crap in your life year after year. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You thought about throwing it out. [EXCLAIMS] “Still works. “Maybe I’ll put it back and let it die a natural death. “I don’t want to rush it. It’s still… “You know, this Sony Walkman cassette player. This… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I know we don’t use cassettes, and we never will, “but if we did, this is REO Speedwagon. “Listen to that. It’s still going. “It’s still going.” “You know, this electric blanket, “I know the kids are grown, and this is a ratty, “disgusting, fiery death trap, “but you know what? That still… Wow. “That’s still working. Look at that.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So what do you do? What do you do? You have something that still works, but you don’t want to… Have a garage sale, right? Have a yard sale. People enjoy it. Personally, I can’t do it. I can’t do it. It takes a certain type of balls. It takes a certain magnitude of moxie to look a stranger in the eye, and just tell him, “I don’t want this crap anymore, “but you might. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Take a look. All my crap could be your crap like that.” So I can’t do that. But you can always find somebody who can use it. You go, “Hey, you know what, the neighbor’s kid “just got his first apartment. “Give him that lamp. The lamp. “I know it’s ugly, and the base is wobbly, “and the neck is hanging by a thread, “but it still works. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Kid’s not gonna want to sit in the dark. Give him a lamp.” Here’s the problem there. Kid could get insulted. Kid go, “You giving me this? It’s a piece of crap.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And you have to go, “I know. “That’s why I’m giving it to you. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I’m not gonna give you the good stuff. “I’m giving you the crap.” On the other hand, it could go the other way. Kid might go, “You’re getting rid of this?” “Oh, I love this. Thanks.” And that’s where you’ll go, “You know what? Let me have that back. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I was on the fence, to be honest, “but when I saw your enthusiasm, “I realized I was a bit hasty.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But one way or another, whether you throw it out, give it away, donate it, the garbage pile goes away. Save pile, that’s very simple. Just put everything in a box, kick it down the road, you’ll deal with it next time you move, or just wait till you’re dead, and the kids can fight over who wants it less. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Then you get to the mother lode, the not sure pile. This is where a lot of marriages and mental health go to die. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Because there are a lot of decisions. And what is in there? What is it that we’re so not sure about? It’s always sentimental stuff, right? You open the closet, “Oh, look, “the kids’ finger paintings from kindergarten. [EXCLAIMING] “the diorama of the Navajo Village “from second grade that we did all the work on, “if I remember correctly. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “We can’t throw that out.” “No, throw it out. This is not what you want to take “into the next chapter of your life. “Throw it. It has no value.” The only value is in that second when you find it, you go, [WAILS] and then throw it the fuck out. You don’t want it. You don’t want it. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Don’t put it back. It won’t increase in value. It’s not a Picasso, okay? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] The hardest part, when I got to my crap, I could not believe what I had been dragging with me for decades. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] I had boxes of crap… Started in my parents’ house. When I got my first apartment, I put a bunch of crap in a box, whole bunch of boxes, took ’em with me to my apartment. Never opened it. Didn’t need to. Moved from New York, moved out to California, Crap came with me. Now I have California crap. Okay. Got married, got a house. Now I got a… Crap is in the house. We got kids, needed more room, crap went into storage, now it’s back. I don’t know how that happened, but here it is. So now we’re downsizing, and we have to finally open these hermetically sealed time capsules. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And what have I been dragging around with me for 50 years? I go, “Ah, look, my Little League trophy. “‘Fifth place. Nice effort.’ Look at that, sweetie.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING] Yes. “Your husband made a nice effort in 1968. “I don’t think you were aware of that. “You’re married to quite the athlete. You don’t know…” Then went, “Ah, look, my book report from 4th grade. “Huckleberry Finn. I got an A++. “Maybe the kids would enjoy reading…” No, they don’t. Let me help you. They don’t. They don’t. They never will. You don’t want your crap. Imagine how much your kids don’t want your crap. Because kids are not nostalgic, you know. Kids have not been around long enough to nostalge. They don’t have that. Kids are looking forward. Kids are all about the future, whereas you have very limited future. Let’s be honest. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, I don’t care how old you are, what kind of shape you’re in, I’m just saying, every day, less future. You understand this, right? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I can’t be the first person explaining this to you. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Every day, less future. If you think I’m lying, tomorrow morning, look at your calendar. “He was right. One day less.” There’s less. And they’re not making more. This is it, folks. This is it. So, you know, use it wisely. For God’s sake, don’t do what I did. Don’t waste your precious remaining days going through boxes of letters from girls who broke up with you in 10th grade, that you’ve been saving in the off chance that maybe they’ll rethink it… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …and come crawling back. Like they’re gonna show up at my door now, “Why did I ever break up with you in 1973?” You can pull out the letter. “Does that ring a bell, sweetheart?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, that ship has sailed. You’re all… You’re married, she’s married. Plus, you’re both old. You know what? It’s not that… What you remember is not how it is. The cute girl that you remember from the high school yearbook with the tight jeans and the perky sweater, she’s now a 68-year-old grandmother of five, okay? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She has an arthritic hip, she doesn’t hear in one ear, and you, I think we know what’s happened with you, so… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Move on. This is what I’m telling you people. Move on. Let it go. You ever bump into somebody that you haven’t seen, like since high school? That can be a jolt. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] That’s a jolt, because, you know, we only remember people the way we last saw them. We don’t extrapolate over time. So I had a… I did a show back east. I was in New York, I did a show. After the show, a woman came… Lovely woman, maybe 70, came over, she said to me, “You went to college in Binghamton, New York.” I said, “Yes, I did.” She said, “Do you remember a girl, Debbie Miller?” I said, “Oh, yeah, absolutely. Is that your daughter?” She went, “No, it’s me.” I went… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I don’t think so. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “That’s not how I remember it at all. “I happen to have the yearbook right here. “Let me show you. Here. You look like that. “What has happened to you? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “No, me, I have mirrors in my house. “I’m not shocked anymore. But you… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I turn my back for, what, 50 years, “and you let this happen. Why?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I don’t make fun of anybody. It’s not… Listen, I am not perfect. I-I am not perf… You know, when you pay with a credit card while it’s reading the chip, it says, “Do not remove”? Sometimes I remove. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Just being honest. [AUDIENCE TITTERS] I don’t know why they care so much. What if I remove it? Who am I hurting? I’ll put it back. It’s not a big… What? There’s no lying. I’m the only one here. I’m gonna put it in. I’ll take it out. I’ll put it back. Who cares? I don’t know why they… I’ve gotten very skeptical of any kind of… Any kind of, you know, notice, or… I got a thing on my phone the other day, those updates, “Your data storage cloud “is completely filled.” And my brain went straight to, “Is it, though? Is it, really? Is it?” [AUDIENCE TITTERS] “Oh, yes, it is filled. “That’s why we’re reaching out. It is totally filled.” “That’s weird, because I never put anything in the cloud.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Well, be that as it may, “it’s stuffed. It is totally stuffed. “Shit’s falling out of your cloud. “I hate to tell you, the other clouds “have been mentioning it because it’s not pretty, what’s happening. “It’s just disgusting up there. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “It’s coming out of your cloud.” “Can I see the cloud?” “No. Nobody sees the cloud. “Nobody not no-how. “But it is stuffed. “That’s why we’re… I’ll tell you what, though, “for $999, I can get you a bigger cloud. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “You’re gonna like this cloud. “You can’t see this one either, but trust me, it’s the el grande. I don’t trust these people. I don’t trust them. And by the way, they don’t trust us. They don’t trust us. How many times have you gone on a website and they don’t even believe that you’re a human being? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And they have to screen you. “Are you a robot? “We won’t be mad, just be… Honestly, are you a robot?” “Let me ask you, if I was a robot, “why would I tell you? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Doesn’t that kind of defeat the whole purpose of being a robot?” Because robots are not stupid, you know. We program robots to do a lot of smart things. I’ll bet you, with a little extra effort, we could teach them to lie. It’s not that hard. Just type it in. “If they ask, ‘Are you a robot?’ “You say, ‘No.'” You can even program a little attitude. “Do I look like a fucking robot?” You know, why couldn’t they do that? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Okay. Okay. But they’re expecting that. They’re ready for the lying robots. That’s why they always have that second-tier test, the little picture test with the eight pictures. “Which picture has a school bus, or a chimney, or a crosswalk, or a palm tree? You would think that’s easily within the realm of what a robot could do, right? No, they can’t. They’re stuffed, they stymied by the picture test. They get that far, and then they go… [EXCLAIMS] We don’t know what that is! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It’s yellow and big and… Ah, we gotta go back. Can’t do it. They cannot do it. Whereas I, not to brag, am very good at these tests. I, I… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I am. I get them all right every time. I’m very good at it. I can… School bus, school bus, not a school bus, not a school bus, school bus, not a school bus, not a school bus. Give me another one. Come on. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, I know I’m already in, but I’m enjoying myself. Keep them coming. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] What have you got? All right, chimney, chimney, not a chimney, not a chimney, chimney, chimney, not a chimney. Crosswalk, crosswalk, little piece of a crosswalk. That counts. Crosswalk, little crosswalk, no crosswalk. But they’re not always easy. Sometimes, they try to trip you up. Palm tree, palm tree. Well, it could be a ficus. You know what? Hang on. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I don’t know how specific they want to be with the trees. You know, I figured out why I love these tests so much. I’m just so happy to be asked something I know. Because there’s so much I don’t know. Because the brain can only handle so much. There’s a certain point in life, there’s not much that can get in there. You know, all these things that I’m talking about as we age, they don’t all happen at one time, which… That would be nice. If they gave you a date, and they said, here’s your old person date, and then you can prepare, and that’s the day when everything just goes bad. But they don’t do it like that. They just eat, get out… it’s like a slow drip. Every week, I notice something new that worked better a few weeks ago. Like… the last couple of years, I was squinting a lot. My eyes were… I was squinting. Recently, I noticed I’m going the other way. Just whoa… Whoa… Opening my eyes wide. This isn’t working. That’s got to do it. I’ll throw more vision at the problem. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I’ll will it into focus. First time I noticed, I was on my computer, and I realized I was making the font a little bigger every week. First time you go from a 12 to 14, it’s like night and day. You go, “that’s fantastic.” Why didn’t I do this years ago? This is fantastic. But then it’s like crack. You can’t get enough. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You go, 18 is even better than 14. Look at that! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You know what? 24. Nothing to be embarrassed about 36. That, then, oh, that’s… 48. Pretty damn good. I mean like… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] I’m at 157, and honestly, just… You can read it from out of town. That’s how big the… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I had to get reading glasses. Never had reading glasses. Took them home, Still couldn’t really make out the computer. I called the eye doctor. I said, “These glasses are not really working. “The computer is still blurry.” He said, “Oh, did you want computer glasses?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You told me you wanted reading glasses. I said, “What?” He said, yeah, those are two different focal lengths. Reading your book is six to eight inches from the eye. A computer is generally 12 to 14 inches from the eye. I said, “Yeah, but, you could move the computer.” He said, “But you won’t.” I said, “That’s so true.” He said, “I’ll give you another pair. “Use that for six to eight, “use the other pair for 12 to 14.” I said, “Let me ask you this. “What if there’s something in the middle?” And he said, “Don’t look at it. “What do you want me to tell you?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] He said, “Nine, ten, eleven inches. “That’s going to be a dead zone. I’ll tell you right now.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I can help you up to eight or after 12. “In the middle, you’re on your own. “Nothing I can do. “If anybody approaches in that area, tell them, “move up or move back. But don’t hover.” So I got reading glasses. I have computer glasses. I have driving glasses. I have driving at night glasses. If I’m in my house, and I wanna look out the window, separate for glasses for that. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I got like 14 pairs of glasses now. I’m solid. I got all the glasses I need. Problem is, my brain is fading. I don’t know where the glasses are. So… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] So they’re not helping. They’re not helping. And I had heard about that… short-term memory. They always tell you, as you get older, your short-term memory will diminish. So, I was anticipating a little hit to the short-term memory. What I didn’t understand was just how short… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …the term is. It’s a short term. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I was talking to my friend. I said, “Hey, this trip you’re going on? “Is that for business? Are you going just for fun?” He said, “Oh, the latter.” And I went… “I don’t remember what order I just said it.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] I just said it! That’s not a memory. That’s now. That’s short-term now. I’m losing my now. I don’t remember anything anymore. But I’m honest about it. I tell people right up front, as they’re talking to me, I will tell them, “Hey, just so you understand, “this is the same as if you weren’t talking to me, “okay? Just…” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] “No, I can hear you, and it’s nice to see you, “but it’s not going in. That’s what I’m saying. “If it’s important, write it down. “Wait, you know what? Tell my wife. “But I’m telling you, I can’t hold it. “I have maxed out. My cloud is totally filled. “I cannot… “It cannot go in there.” Sometimes I do remember what people tell me, but… then I don’t know who told it to me. That’s the thing. I spend a lot of my life going, “Who was I talking to? “Who was I talking to? “I was just talking about that. “Yes, the zebra that exploded in the zoo. “We were talking… Who was I talking to? “I heard… who was I talking to?” That’s why it’s great. If you’re married, if you have a… If you’re in a couple, if you’re married, you’re in a couple, you have a built-in backup system, 24-7. You just go, “Honey, who were we talking to about the zebra? “Huh? Who were… You weren’t there?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Who was I talking to? Do you have any idea?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Where have I been the last four or five days? “Any recollection?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] “Who could I have been talking to? That’s what I’m trying to get… “Throw some names at me, I’ll see if anything rings a bell.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Are you not keeping track? “Remember, I asked you to keep a list of where I go, “and who I talked to? Yes, I did. “I asked… I didn’t ask you? I asked somebody. “Who was I talking to? “I could have sworn that was you.” And again, see, we know these things are gonna happen. We’ve seen it happen with other people. So we know it’s coming, but we don’t know when. We don’t even know in what sequence these things will happen. So, right now, at this point, I’m just on constant lookout, waiting to see which bodily function goes south next. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And I had a frightening moment. I was driving, and I accidentally, with my elbow, I hit the… little dial for the seat heater. So, the pinholes are shooting up heat. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But I didn’t know that I did anything. Do you understand? So, I’m driving, I’m minding my own business, and just all of a sudden… Hmmm… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] This is new. This is new. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] I just noticed, from the waist down, everything was hot. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] It was like a general hotness in the bottom half of me. And my first thought… I’m not proud of this… but my first thought was… I think I just shit myself. Yep. Make a note, sweetie. Today’s the day it started. I… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] Hmm? No, I don’t feel sick at all. That’s what’s surprising. No, I… No, I didn’t eat anything out of the ordinary! You were with me the whole… you saw, I was just sitting here, driving, and… dropped a load. I don’t know how to put it to you, but… We’re going to pull over, change my pants, and get a new car, because we can’t live like this. We cannot live like this. These are just some of the wonderful highlights we can look forward to on our journey. But I’ll tell you, you know, if you’re lucky enough, and you have the right partner on your journey, it makes the whole trip a lot more manageable, and a lot more entertaining. If you’re lucky enough to have the right partner, and… Right? It helps. It helps. And I have to say, I am very, very lucky. I married a wonderful woman… initially, but you know what? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, let me finish. Let me… Here’s how hard marriage is. I absolutely married the perfect woman. She’s beautiful, she’s intelligent, she’s independent, she’s successful, she’s kind-hearted, she’s a great mother, and we’re perfectly matched! We had the same values, the same taste, same sense of humor, same everything. Couldn’t be more perfectly matched for each other. And still… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] With all that, three out of five days, I’m slamming my head against a wall. So that’s how hard it is. I have a friend who’s not married. He’s like in his 50s. Not married, never been married, and he’s never going to be married. And the reason I know that, is he tells me all the time, defiantly, “I’ll never get married.” He says, “I don’t care what you say, Paul. “I will never get married.” And I tell him, “I don’t care.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I said I don’t get a commission. You understand that? I… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I don’t work for the organization. Just had the little TV show. That was the whole extent of it. I’m not involved. He said, but… He’s mystified by my… [CHUCKLING] …marriage. He said, “How do you do it? “How do you stay with one woman your whole life? “What’s the secret?” I said what do I know? I said, I don’t know a secret. I said, I’ve only been married one time to one woman. I said, and by the way, in all that time, I’ve only learned one thing, if I’m being honest, I said, and I’ll give it to you. If it helps, I’ll share it with you. This is what I told him. This is the only thing I know to be true. I said to him, I said, [HESITATES] …when you’re with a woman, sometimes, you’re going to want to say something. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …if a little voice in your head says, “I wouldn’t say it now…” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …you want to listen to the voice. That’s all I can tell you. It’s there to help you. You may have a question, and it can be a perfectly reasonable question. But if you hear a voice say, “All right, but I wouldn’t ask it right now,” trust the voice. That’s why it’s there. You’ll never regret it. Nobody gets to the end of their life and goes, “Oh, if only I could ask more irritating shit, “I could have, I could have… “I had the opportunity, and then I didn’t do it.” No. Because by the way, even if what you want to say is sweet, and loving, and wonderful, it can come out wrong… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …as I have learnt. So, okay, this happened. The other day, I had a really, a lovely moment. I was watching my wife in the house, and I just… was watching her, and I was overcome with a really wonderful feeling of appreciation and affection and gratitude. I was just watching her, “I’m going, God, am I lucky!” I said, “What a wonderful… I’m so lucky. “I married such a wonderful woman.” And I said, “Boy, she does a thousand things a day “that we don’t even know about “that just keep the trains running, “and make our lives great. “And she does… She does everything for us. “And boy, God forbid, something ever happened to her, “I’d be lost. I wouldn’t know how to go on. “My life would be empty and hollow without her.” This is what I’m thinking. My wife sees me staring at her oddly. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She said, ‘What?” Here’s what came out of my mouth. “Nothing. I was just picturing if you were dead…” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] [MOUTHING INDISTINCTLY] You see what I’m saying? That’s not reflective at all! Um, what I… You see that! It’s very hard to clean that one up, I’ll be honest. But you learn, you learn over time. There are certain things you can only learn in a long-term relationship. I have learned… Okay, here’s an example. So when we’re sleeping, my wife, who I adore, just so we’re clear, when we’re sleeping, she doesn’t snore, because women don’t snore. I understand. I understand. Having said that, there is a noise, uh… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …coming out of this area of her. There is a noise that, if you didn’t know better, you’d go, “That sounds like snoring.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And I actually kind of, I don’t mind it. I find it endearing. For the first few minutes, anyway, I just marvel. I go, “Really?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Really, a face that beautiful “could make a sound that atrocious. “That doesn’t seem possible.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But after a few minutes, you want to go to sleep. So here’s what I’ve learned. Again, only over time. If you put your hand on her shoulder, and gently shove… Gently… You know what? Practice on the dog. Listen to me. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] The dog is sleeping on the bed, and starts snoring. Just go…”Ay!” If you hear, [IMITATES YELPING] That’s too hard. So, that’s how you know. Just… You want to dial that down. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But not too soft because then you’ve accomplished nothing. So you want… what you’re aiming for… You want to break their breathing cycle. That’s what you’re going for. And you’ll know you do it right when you hear this sound. [makes sucking sound] That’s it. It’s not pretty. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] It’s not a pretty sound. But that’s what’s… [makes sucking sound] It’s like throwing a wrench under a tractor. It’s not nice, but… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That’s your cue to turn over and go the hell to sleep. Because if you linger, her eyes will open, and she’ll just go, “Did you just shove me?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And you have to go, “I don’t think so.” [SCOFFS] “In fact, I’m sleeping. “So I don’t even know why you’re talking to me.” See, I… I try to live by the golden rule. And we all know the golden rule. Do unto others as you would have done unto you. It’s a great idea in life. It’s great in life. In marriage, [CLICKS TONGUE] not so much. Uh… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It doesn’t always work in marriage, because I’ll be honest, there are many things I would happily have done unto me, that she don’t like done unto her. And, and… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She’s very vocal about it. She goes, “I don’t like when you do that.” And it sounds like I’m talking about something dirty. No. No, I mean simple things. Simple… If she’s driving, and I’m in the passenger seat, and I politely point out that our exit is coming up, oh, she gets so insulted. “You don’t have to tell me. I know.” I said, “Well, all right. I… “You know, hey, sometimes, you point it out to me. “And I don’t get offended.” She goes, “Right, because you don’t mind.” I said, “Right! What?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, I’m saying I don’t mind. She goes, “Right. But I do, “because I’m not you.” And that’s when I go, “Well, then, “the golden rule is not fucking working here, is it?” Because I only know me. I don’t know who else to draw from. If the golden rule is not working, let’s try the silver or the bronze, because… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …the silver rule, I think, “Do unto others’ best guesses of what you think they might like done unto them.” And the bronze rule is, “You know what? “Don’t do unto anybody, anything. “Just sit there, eat your chicken, “wait till the show’s over. Just don’t get involved.” And I don’t wanna give you the impression… You know, I’m talking a lot about my marriage and… It’s all good. You know, I don’t want to… It’s all good. [SOFTLY] Know what I’m saying, it’s not all good. But you know what I’m saying, it’s all good. In general, it’s all good. It’s like the world. From space, looking down, it’s all good. You zoom in close, it’s not all good. You know what I’m saying? But you have to scale back, and it’s all good. When my friend asked me, you know, what’s the secret? I said, I must have learned something. And I said “Actually, I do have something. “I have something for you.” And this, I do believe to be true. For any long-term relationship, to keep it growing and keep it moving, you have to constantly find something new to fight about. That is so important. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I cannot stress that enough. So like in my house, the current friction du jour that I’m enjoying immensely, uh, my wife who I adore, we understand… …she has come to view with displeasure, my response time. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Do you know what I mean by response time? The gap in the time continuum from when she asks me something to the microsecond that I answer, that gap is not to her liking. She… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She would prefer a snappy or brisker retort than the one I am affording. And in fairness to her, I got to be honest. A lot of times I do respond, but in my head. I just forget to talk. I… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That’s not her fault. That’s on me. I… “Did I not speak? I thought I spoke. I…” “You know, I just ran out of steam. “At 4:30, I just ran…” So, sometimes I don’t answer because of whatever that phenomenon is. Sometimes, though, I don’t answer [CLICKS TONGUE] because, to be honest, I didn’t hear the question. I didn’t hear it. The hearing is not as crisp as it used to be. But that’s not all the time. Sometimes I don’t answer right away because I’m thinking. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She asked me a question, I’d like to give an intelligent, thoughtful response. She doesn’t buy it. She… If I don’t answer it right away, she presumes it’s just because I’m old and deaf. So what she’ll do, is she’ll repeat what she just said, louder, and with ten times the hostility. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] It jumps. It goes from, [SOFTLY] “What do you want for supper,” Straight to, [LOUDLY] “what do you want for…” “I know, I heard you, sweetheart. I heard it. “I was thinking. Maybe I should’ve have gone, ah, do do do do do… “Would that help you? “Do-do-do-do… chicken.” And by the way, her hearing is going too. However, it’s not her fault. It’s not her fault. The way I understand it… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] If I don’t hear her, that’s because my ears are going bad. If she doesn’t hear me, that’s because I don’t speak clearly. So… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING] You see the problem. Yes. This is the problem area. Either way you come at it, here seems to be the problem. And I called her on it one day. I said, “Sweetie, it’s always me, really? “It’s always me. It’s never you?” She said, “Yeah, Now, get the car. We’re late.” I said, “What, where are we going?” She said we’re not going anywhere. I said, “Why did you say get the car, we’re late?” She said, “I said, you need to articulate.” I said, “Okay.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It’s not how I heard. I said, “Well, maybe you need to articulate!” And then she mumbled something about going to truck yourself. We don’t have a truck. So… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] You know, it doesn’t even make sense. You see what I’m saying. Yeah. She’s starting to lose it. This is my concern. Yeah. And all married couples go through it. My parents went through this. I remember, in their golden years, my mother called me one night. She said, “I’m worried about your father. “It’s like he doesn’t hear me. “It’s like he doesn’t hear me.” So, she got him to go to an audiologist. The guy was like the 12th best in town. He was fine. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But this guy was smart. First question he said to my father, “Mr. Reiser, let me ask you, “how long are you married?” My father said, “46 years. Why?” The doctor said, “There’s the problem.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, apparen… There’s a medical thing. Apparently, if you hear the same voice for that duration of time, it wears down that particular frequency… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] …in the ear canal. That’s what’s happening. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] That’s a scientific thing. Both ways. Him to her, her to him, him to him, them to them… Pronouns are not an issue. Any two people, over time, will over-tax that pathway. You can hear above, you can hear below. But that pathway, dead. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] My problem is a little more subtle. Like I said, I hear everything my wife says, but apparently, [CLICKS TONGUE] I hear it wrong. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I hear, “Well, if she said what I heard, we’re doing fine.” But often, it’s not what she said. We were in the kitchen the other day. She’s standing in front of the cabinet where we keep the candy, and she’s squinting. She’s looking into the candy cabinet, And she asked me… I thought… …for the name of our ophthalmologist. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Well, I saw her squinting. It didn’t seem unreasonable. So I said… “Schneiderman.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING LOUDLY, CLAPPING] “What?” Our ophthalmologist is Dr. Schneiderman. “Okay.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Why are you telling me that?” I said, “Did you not just ask me the name of our ophthalmologist?” She said, “No, I said what happened to all the HOT TAMALES?” I said, “All right, well… “that’s not how I heard it.” But I can see why saying “Schneiderman” wasn’t helpful there. Unless Schneiderman ate the HOT TAMALES. but how could that… No, it couldn’t be. It’s… And what makes it extra tricky? Sometimes, you’re not supposed to respond. Sometimes you’re not even supposed to be listening. Sometimes yes, sometimes no, but it’s not always clear what rules are in effect at any given moment. So my lovely wife, who… I adore… We’ve established, right? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She will walk into the room, and she’ll very quietly go, “Meh, I can’t believe it.” I go, “What’s the matter?” She’ll go, “I was talking to myself.” I said, “Okay, sorry.” And then, at the exact same volume, she’ll go, “Where did I put my phone?” “Hello?” That was to me then? The second part? So the second part was to me. Okay, so the first one, no, but the second one was to me. You were talking to me? She said, “Do you see anybody else here?” I’m like… “Mmm, mmm.” I thought you were talking to yourself. She said, well, evidently I was. Okay. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] I said, “My beloved… “We need a system. We need a system. “Help me help you. “How do I know when you’re talking to me, “and when you’re talking to you?” She said, “It should be obvious.” I said… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “It’s not. It’s not. “If it were obvious, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.” But it’s always… it’s only the little things. Like I said, all the big things… We get along on all the big things, we agree. It’s only the little things that will come up and sort of jeopardize a perfectly good union. And I was… This was… Again, I don’t know what things… We’re sitting around, I had my phone out, and I was trying to plan my week, yeah? And I said to my wife, casually, very casually, I said, “Sweetie, are we doing anything Saturday night?” [CLICKS TONGUE] She said… “Are you kidding me?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I’m like… Whoa! And my knees buckle a little bit. I said, whoa! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “Whoa!” I think I’m forgetting something quite significant. Saturday… are we getting divorced Saturday? Is that… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I thought that was just an idle threat. But is that happening? I’m sorry, what is Saturday? She goes, we’re having dinner with Rob and Beth. I said, oh, so that’s on. We’re doing that? She said, “Are you kidding me?” She said, “You’re the one who asked us “to make it Saturday. “Remember we had a whole conversation?” She said, “We were going to do it two weeks ago, “but you couldn’t do it, and you asked me to see “if they could move it to this Sat… “Do you really not recall this whole conversation?” And I said, “Well, the first half, yes, “I remember asking you to see if they could move it, “but they never got back. I never heard back “that yes, they can do it. And yes, we’re on. She said, “Okay, well, but… I told you.” I said, how do we know that? Do you have film of you telling me? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [PAUL STUTTER] I said, “Why do you assume I forgot that you told me? “Maybe you forgot that you didn’t tell me? “That could happen.” And it wouldn’t have been a big deal, but it happened to be the third day in a row. I forgot something stupid. And that’s the one that broke her. It broke her. It was one, too many… She wasn’t angry. She went beyond anger, to a state I had never seen. Uh… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She just looked at me differently. She looked at me with such a look of compassion and affection and just… genuine… just… it was just so angelic. She looked at me, and she said, I’m worried about you. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I’m… I think we have to have you checked.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I said, checked? For what? She said, “I don’t know, “dementia, or early onset, something. “Something is happening.” I said, “Sweetie, “20 years ago, it would have been early. “This is on time. This…” “This is…” Yeah. “This is on time onset. That’s what this is. “This is precisely when onset would set on.” I said, “But play it out. “How would that even help you?” Let’s say I go to a doctor. He looks in my head and goes, “Yeah, we see that he’s got a thing. “There’s something sitting on his memory. “And that’s why his memory… he is forgetting things, because there’s a thing on his memory. How would that help you? She said, “‘Cause at least then, I would know I could adapt. “I would adjust, I would write things down for you. “I’d repeat things. I’d be more patient. I’d be nicer. I said, “Why don’t we go straight to that?” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CLAPPING] If you got a perfectly good solution, why would you hold it back like that? She said, “No, I’m not gonna… “Unless you have a note from your doctor, “I’m not going to be nicer. No. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CLAPPING] “No, unless you have an actual medical condition, “I’m not going to assist you. Step up your game, “and you start remembering these things “because this is not okay!” I said, “Why don’t I split the difference? “Say I got a little bit of something, and you just be a little bit nicer? “And then we’ll bump it up every year.” A little bit, little bit, little bit, till we get to the end of our lives. I said, “You’ll be the nicest person in the world, “and I won’t remember any of this.” Thank you so much, folks! Thank you, Denver. I’m going to say one thing, and then I’ll let you go. That’s how I get off the phone with my family and friends, by the way. I go, “You know, let me let you go.” Sometimes they trip you up. “We don’t have to go.” “All right, well, let me let you let me go.” “I don’t know how…” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “I’m pulling the plug one way or the other.” Now, I just wanna say one thing. You know, at the top of the show, I said I wasn’t going to say anything important. I changed my mind. I’m gonna say something very important, and I’m gonna… Hear this… I’m gonna share with you the secret of life. I’m going to tell you the secret of life. But it came to me in a very odd way. Years ago, I got to make a movie, and I worked with… my idol, Peter Falk. Do you remember Peter Falk, Colombo? When I was a kid, I didn’t care about acting. Comedians… my idols were all comedians. I never cared about acting. But when I was like eight years old, I saw Peter Falk in a movie. I said, “What’s this guy doing? I love this guy!” So, years went by and I said, I want to… work with him. I wrote a movie where he played my father, and we got to be friends. And so one day, we’re talking about comedy. And I said, “Well, so what do you like? “What kind of comedies do you like?” So Peter Falk says, [IN RASPY VOICE] “Well, you know, uh…” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] “…to be honest, “a lot of the things that make me laugh. “They don’t make other people laugh.” I said, “Well, try me. I’d be curious.” So he tells me this story which I’m gonna share with you. And I thought it was funny. I thought it was a very funny story. But over the years, I thought about it. I said, it’s more than funny. This story has hidden inside it, the secret of life. Here’s the story. So, Peter goes to lunch at a deli, a New York-style deli, all right? Waiter, old school waiter, but waiting tables 100 years, seen it all, nothing fazes him. He comes to the table, and he says, “Would anybody like dessert?” Peter Falk says, “Do you have rice pudding?” The guy says yes. Peter goes, “Hang on. “Before you bring it, “Does it have raisins?” The guy says no. He says, “Are you sure?” He says yeah. He says, “You’re positive? Because, a lot of places, “they put raisins in their rice puddings. “And I can’t eat raisins. “If it has a raisin, I don’t want it. I’ll tell you right now, “if it has raisins, I don’t want it.” The waiter says, “Mr. Falk, “I don’t know how else to tell you no. “There’s no raisins in the rice pudding. Peter Falk says, “All right, I’ll have it.” Waiter goes to the kitchen, brings out the rice pudding. It’s a chockful of raisins. Just… [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Just covered. Top to bottom. [STUTTERS] Through the glass, dark with raisins. Peter Falk says, “Hey, I thought you said there’s no raisins!” The waiter just shrugged and said, “Here and there you’ll find a raisin.” [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And I said, well, that’s what life is, isn’t it? Nothing is all good. Even the things you love have things in it you don’t love! But that’s just the cost of doing business. So that’s what I wish for you nice people. In the rice pudding of life, deal with the raisins, but don’t forget to enjoy the pudding. Thank you so much. Good night. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING]\"],\n",
              " 'seth': ['In\\xa0Seth Meyers: Dad Man Walking, the comedian brings his signature wit and relatability to the stage, weaving hilarious stories about parenting, marriage, and modern life with sharp observations on societal quirks. Sharing tales of his kids’ chaotic antics, from “a secret that’s brown” to surreal bedtime negotiations, Meyers hilariously captures the exhausting yet rewarding reality of fatherhood. He also riffs on marriage dynamics, his ineptitude with strollers, and the absurdity of TSA rules about hummus. Balancing personal anecdotes with clever commentary on cultural topics, including the challenges of navigating modern sensitivities, Meyers delivers a comedy special that’s as heartfelt as it is laugh-out-loud funny, leaving the audience in stitches. * * * ♪ [TV static ] [bright tone] [cheers and applause] How we doing, Chicago? [cheering] How we doing, Vic Theatre? It’s so wonderful to be with you tonight. It’s so wonderful to be with you. Guys, I’m gonna get right into it. I’m having a crisis of confidence. I’m having a crisis of confidence because my six-year-old has recently started saying something that’s funnier than any joke I’ve written in the past year. When my six-year-old has to pee, he comes over and says, I have to pee. When my six-year-old has to poop, he comes over, and he whispers in my ear, I have a secret that’s brown. It’s perfect, no notes. Because what else could it possibly be? I have a secret that’s brown. Let me guess, you got to poop? No, Mom’s having an affair with the UPS guy. And look, it’s great anytime you’re a parent and your kid says something funny. It’s so much better if you’re a comedian because the minute he said it, I couldn’t wait to get out on stage and tell it to you. Because that’s the thing, the most important thing to me is that my kids are happy, but I also love when they’re material. To put it in a simpler way, I want them to be content, but I also want them to be content. I did a special called “Lobby Baby” because my second– [cheers and applause] Thank you. [cheering] My second was born in the lobby of our apartment building. It was an incredible story. But even more than that, do you know what sound it makes when you’re a comedian and your child is born in the lobby of an apartment building? Cha-fucking-ching. Like, as far as I’m concerned, “Lobby Baby” has paid for college. Secret that’s brown, on his way. That’s not enough for a four-year accredited university, but it’s a couple of semesters at DeVry. I am gonna talk a fair amount about having kids tonight, and I appreciate that not everyone here is a parent. We do have a pretty cool consolation prize for you, which is this– at the end of the night, you all get to go back to a home where no fucking kids live. So that– [cheering] That’s pretty great. You can go binge a show, whatever that means. Bingeing a show? My wife and I are so tired, not only do we not binge shows, I would describe the way we watch television as microdosing. We watch 10 minutes of an episode at a time. My wife falls asleep after the first five minutes, but I’m not allowed to turn it off because the sudden drop in volume will wake her up. So I just have to slowly bring down the volume, continuing to watch while the characters just get quieter and quieter, which I think is what it’s like to watch TV when you’re having a stroke. And then, the next night, I have to go back and watch those five minutes again. I start with that. Basically, what I’m saying is for us to finish an episode of television, it takes like three and a half months. I’m gonna talk about my kids. So I should tell you their names. My kids are named Ashe, Axel, and Addie. And independently, those are all great names. Together, it is a disaster. It’s such a weird, mean thing to do to grandparents to bring over three kids and be like, here are your grandkids, ah, ah, ah. They’re just– Old people need words that sound massively different in their pronunciation. It’s why Lipitor doesn’t rhyme with arsenic. You need a safety buffer. I’m not gonna tell you whose idea it was to give all three of our kids A names. I will only tell you that my name is Seth, and my wife’s name is Alexi. A lot of times, people say, oh, Alexi. You must get her name mixed up with the kids’ names as well because it’s also an A name. And I don’t. I would say the hardest thing about having a wife named Alexi is how often our Alexa thinks I’m talking to it. And making matters worse, I only use my wife’s first name when we’re fighting and I’m being passive aggressive, which means our Alexa often says things like, I’m sorry, I don’t know what you mean by, we all can’t be as perfect as you. I’m raising kids in New York City. I love raising kids in New York City. One thing, of course, though, when you’re raising kids in New York City or any city is you have to be cognizant of safety all the time. I walk my boys to school every day, and from a very young age, we came up with something when we cross the street, which is we’d walk up to the curb, and we would look at the cross light. And if it was a red hand, all three of us would say, red hand, and we’d stop. And if it was a green man, all three of us would say, green man. And then we’d cross the street. And I enjoyed it, and the boys were tickled by it. And passers by seemed delighted by the whole show. And so it was just great. And then the other day, my wife was with us, and she looked up at the cross light, and she said, you know, it’s actually more white than green. And I said, yeah. I don’t know how good I’d feel about me and the boys all announcing white man before we cross the street. Making matters worse, my boys walk and talk like this. White man! Make way for white man! Motorists and cyclists take heed! For there is white man in the thoroughfare! Safe passage is our birthright. I would describe being a parent as just constantly suppressing your true self. Here’s a good example. When you’re a parent, you have to watch your language all the time. And I do. I try very hard to watch my language in front of my kids. However, with that said, I sometimes feel I don’t get enough credit for the first word I wanted to say. Like, for example, the other day, I was in the kitchen. All the kids were within earshot, and I put my hand on the stove, and I burned it, and I went, goddamn it. And my wife looked at me as if to say, you need to do a better job. And I agree with that. But at the same time, I wanted to gather the entire family around and say, you guys know the word Daddy wanted to say was motherfucker, right? And when you have motherfucker locked and loaded, you can’t downshift all the way to rats. You just can’t do it. At my age, I’d throw my back out if I did that. If you ever see Daddy wearing a neck brace, know he wanted to scream, son of a bitch, and instead said, sassafras! You never want to say a bad word in front of your children because then your spouse will blame you for it every time they say it for the rest of their life. The nice thing, though, is you can tell based on how a kid says a word where they learned the word. Like, for example, you can tell when your kids learned a bad word at school. Like, the other day, one of our kids came home, and he just danced through the living room going, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. And my wife looked at me like it was my fault. And I’m like, he didn’t get that from me. I’ve never stubbed my toe and then done, like, a kick ball chain across the room. Just as easily, however, you can tell when they learned it from you. The other day, my son was building a LEGO set, and it was at the dining room table, and the whole thing collapsed. And when it collapsed, he went like this, ugh, fuck this. I was like, that’s me. That was from me. That looked exactly like me. That was like looking into a mirror. It’s not just profanity that is ugly coming out of the mouths of children. There are certain words that we’re always telling our kids not to say. “Disgusting” is a word we’re always begging them not to say. Stupid. We’re always telling them, don’t say stupid. The biggest one is hate. Kids will say all day long that they hate things, and we’re just like, don’t say hate. Say you don’t like, say you don’t care for. And we really try to drill that through their heads. And then the other day, one of my boys ran into our bedroom, and he was like, hey, Dad, you know who I hate? And I said, buddy, we don’t say hate. We say we don’t like. We say we don’t care for. And then I could tell he was upset. So I said, who were you gonna say? And he said, I was gonna say the guy who killed Martin Luther King. And then I immediately was like oh, no, please definitely say hate for that. The last thing I want is my kid walking around town being like, you know who I never cared for? James Earl Ray. The man was not my cup of tea. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I see my light has changed. White man! I could never hate my kids. I could never hate my kids, you guys. I could never hate my kids. With that said, I do think it’s healthy– I do think it’s healthy to keep a mental list of the three things they’re currently doing that I hate the most. I hate how they roll dice. They can’t keep two dice on the table to save their lives. And the minute they start their roll, you know. You’re like, you’re coming in too hot. They’ll say, how does Monopoly work? I’m like, here’s how it works. Keep both dice on the table, you win. Try to remember we’re in a breakfast nook, not the craps table at the Bellagio. Here’s my impression of me playing board games with my kids. And then sometimes after I get the die, I’ll just stay there for a minute. You know, because they don’t know that I have it. And it’s just kind of peaceful to be under the couch. I’ll kick my legs a little bit so they know I’m alive. I’ll just rest there. Make eye contact with the spider. Hello, friend. Do you have children? I hate the way they roll dice. I hate when they wake up in the middle of the night. My kids are at the age now where they’re having nightmares and when they have nightmares, they will come to our room. And when they come to our room, my wife and I know that one of us is gonna have to be up for the next hour trying to coax them back to sleep. And it’s gotten to the point– this is so traumatic for me that it’s gotten to the point that when I hear the doorknob rattle, I actually think to myself, maybe I’ll get lucky and it’s just an intruder. Maybe it’s just an intruder who will politely steal my valuables. And then I won’t have to scratch his back for the next hour. Made a terrible decision last summer. Last summer, my son had a nightmare, and he couldn’t get back to sleep. And I said, how about I scratch your back, buddy? Maybe that’ll help. And now–you guys, now I think he likes the back scratches so much that he’s making up the nightmares. ‘Cause he’s coming into my room, and he does not have the energy of a kid who has actually been spooked. He’s like, bad news! Skeleton man came back! Good news, I’ve already pulled my shirt up. I do have a good parenting hack if you have a kid who’s always asking to get their back scratched. What you do is you take a little piece of masking tape, and you just slap it over their mouths. I hate how they roll dice. I hate when they wake me up in the middle of the night. I’m gonna take a knee for the third one. I hate how much they talk about lava. They talk about lava all the time. I blame the schools. I get it, you’re trying to teach science to young kids. You’re gonna talk about volcanoes. You’re gonna talk about lavas. But then they come home, and they have all these lava questions. And, you guys, I don’t know anything about lava. The only thing I know about lava is if they see it up close, I’ve done a bad job as a father. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been trying to parallel park the car into a tiny spot, and as I’m looking back, I just see two dumb faces looking at me. And they’re like, if you touch lava, do you die? I could never hate my kids. I could never hurt my kids. I could never hurt my kids. You guys, I could never hurt my kids. I will admit, every now and then, I do pull off one of their sweaters as fast as I can. If it’s the end of a long day and they won’t even do me the courtesy of helping me get them undressed, I will take every top layer they’re wearing and yank it upwards because– and it brings me great shame to say it– this moment gives me joy. When it catches. When it catches like this. When I “Clockwork Orange” my children into seeing what they’ve done to me. It’s not permanent. It always goes right back down, you know? I will say, your perspective on almost everything changes once you have kids. And again, mine are eight, six, and two. And I will say, something that has become very haunting to receive in the mail for us is a wedding invitation because one of two things can happen when we receive a wedding invitation. The first thing is that the wedding invitation says, “We’re encouraging people not to bring their children,” and that means we have to find child care for an evening or sometimes a whole weekend. And that’s bad. But what is worse is when they say, “We’re inviting your whole family to witness our special day.” And that is only something that a dumb, unmarried couple would think is a good idea. A dumb, unmarried, childless couple would think it’s a good idea to have kids witness your special day ’cause they don’t know yet that kids will ruin any day, special or otherwise. And when I have three young kids at a wedding, I’m just dreading the moment that I’m gonna have to go out on the dance floor, interrupt the father-daughter dance, and be like, hi, I’m so sorry to interrupt. Congratulations, sir. She makes a beautiful bride. Hey, our kids ate your cake. They ate the whole cake. I don’t know what to say. The cake is gone, and I can tell it’s a really expensive cake. But it’s kind of your fault because we never should have been here. And anyway, if you’re thinking I’m not gonna be punished, I’m gonna be punished ’cause my kids ate a whole giant cake. So that means they’re gonna be up all night, and they’re gonna be shitting all morning. The kids ate the cake. Thank you, by the way, for making them wear tiny tuxedos. You don’t know this yet about kids, but their favorite thing in the world to do is go to a formal wear place while a guy tells them to stand still with pins in his mouth. Thank you for that. Thank you for the tiny tuxedos. We should have bought one ’cause I can’t imagine it would have been less expensive than how fucking expensive it was to rent. Anyways, my wife’s in the car. She wanted me to say goodbye. She’s passive aggressively looking at her phone, ’cause I guess right before she went to the bathroom, she said, don’t let the kids eat the cake. And that’s exactly what had happened. So now she might never talk to me again. But I want you to know I hope you stay married forever. And if you don’t stay married forever and get divorced, I’m gonna come and take a dump on your lawn. Thank you. Good night. Beautiful bride. Can we admit now that having to show a vaccine card to get into a restaurant during COVID was not, in fact, like living in Germany during World War II? Can we admit that now? Because, you guys, every single time I had to show my vaccine card to get into a restaurant, the host or the hostess was so apologetic. They’re like, we’re so sorry. Can we just take a quick look at your vaccine card? Or if you have a picture of your vaccine card on your phone, or if you want to take a picture of my vaccine card and just show it back to me. Or if you can just prove to me that your phone can take pictures, that’s more than enough for us to get you to your table. And I’ve seen a lot of movies about Germany during World War II, and I don’t remember a single scene where the Gestapo behaved that way. I don’t remember a single scene where the Gestapo kicked in the door and was like… [German accent] We demand to see your papers. And we are so sorry. That we are still doing this whole “see your papers” things. This is so irritating to us, too. This is, like, for real, our least favorite part… About being in ze Gestapo. It’s just our boss is such… a Nazi. [normal voice] That is a very offensive German accent. That is a cartoonishly bad German accent. And recently, I did a show, and there was a German audience member. And afterwards, they came up to me, and they said, do you often do a German accent on stage? And I said, yes, I enjoy doing a German accent on stage. And they said, how would you feel if you saw a German comedian doing an American accent on stage? And I said, I’m never gonna see a German comedian. Like, what is the series of events that would have to go wrong in my life for me to, like, walk into a club as someone on stage is like, make some noise for Klaus? And then I’m like, I’ll stick around for this. And then I’m sitting in my seat, and all of a sudden, he’s like, and then Americans are like, I would like 20 Chicken McNuggets. And I’m like, we don’t sound like that. Anyway, after that very rude answer, he regrouped, and he said, well, how about this? Would you do an African accent on stage? And I said, dear God, no. I would never do an African accent on stage. And he said, where is the line? And I said, where is the line for what accents a white comedian can do in 2024? The borders of Europe. That’s the line, from Finland to Italy, from Portugal to Ukraine. I wouldn’t fuck with Turkey. That’s the line. And you can have a healthy comedy career. Here, I’ll show you how it works. Here’s my impression of a Swedish person ordering from a Chinese waiter. [Swedish accent] Yes, hello. Do you have the chicken chow mein tonight? [normal voice] No, we’re out of that. I chose Swedish on purpose because I’m almost certain it’s impossible to do an offensive Swedish accent. And I’m basing that entirely on the fact that “The Muppet Show” never got canceled. How was that OK? How was the Swedish Chef OK? Schmorgedy, borgedy, borgedy. That was– that was–as a child, that was my introduction to Swedish people. That’s how I thought they all behaved. I thought they were imbeciles who were bad with cutlery. Schmorgedy, borgedy, borgedy. Can you imagine– what would it have sounded like if they’d taken the same approach with the Pakistani Chef? I’m not gonna do it. But at least now I know what the sound of 1,500 buttholes closing at the same time is. Fwup. My kids are really lucky. They have all four grandparents in their lives, and they see them all the time in person. But they also see them all the time on FaceTime. They’re interacting with them every day. It’s so unlike how I talk to my grandparents. My dad put me on the phone with my grandmother once a year the way a kidnapper would put a hostage on the phone with the police. He would say, say hello to your grandmother. I’d like, hello. And then he’d grab the phone back. He’s like, now you know the boy’s alive! Put $5 in a birthday card and leave it under the highway overpass. I love having my parents around my kids. It’s one of the most special things you can experience in life. I love it so much. The only thing that’s hard is that your parents are always gonna have a different parenting style from when they did it to the parenting style that you’re currently using now. Again, my dad was a dad of young kids a long time ago, but he was an old-school screamer. My dad would yell at me and my brother, and we were not a three-strike family. We were a one-strike family. If you disobeyed, he would just start laying into you. And we have a much more modern, non-confrontational parenting style. We never yell. We use language like– when they’re misbehaving, we say, I can see you’re upset right now. And while I don’t want to invalidate the very real feelings you’re having, I do encourage you to work through it on a timeline that’s conducive to your schedule while remembering the most important thing, this is just as much your house as it is ours. And sometimes my dad comes over, and he reverts to his old ways. And he tells the kids to stop doing something, and they don’t. And then he just starts screaming at them. And when my dad yells at my kids, I immediately intervene. I always run over. I’m like, Dad, that is not our way. That is your way. And while I would never want to invalidate your way or make you feel less than– But I have to admit something to you guys. When my dad yells at my kids, I always tell him to stop. But also, there is a tiny voice in the back of my head that always wants to scream, give ’em hell, old man! Let ’em know how good they have it! ‘Cause, guys, I got to admit something. I’m not sure our modern parenting style is working. I’m not seeing the day-to-day results. Like, the other day, my eight-year-old just bit my six-year-old, just fully bit him. They weren’t even wrestling. He just saw him across the room. And I just watched him, like, think, like, I’m gonna go bite him right now. He was like a robot that was like, initiate biting protocol. And he went over, and he bit him so hard. And then he said, I didn’t bite him. And I was like, look at the teeth marks. I could take your brother’s arm to an orthodontist right now, and they could fit you for Invisalign. And I was so mad. I never do this. I grabbed my son, and I said, you’re gonna have a timeout in the other room. And I put him in a room, and I slammed the door. And my plan was just to make him spend five minutes thinking about how badly he behaved, just five minutes reflecting on the consequences of his actions. But I’m such a modern wuss, I could only make it, like, two and a half minutes before I started thinking, oh, my God, he’s gonna be in therapy the rest of his life. This is a trauma he’ll never recover from. I have to go in and let him know he’s my little slugger and I’m always gonna love him no matter what. And I opened the door, expecting to see him in a puddle in the middle of the room on the floor. And not only was he not there, he was leaning against the window, looking out across the city, not a care in the world. He looked like he was in a French new wave film. All that was missing was a beret and a cigarette. [French accent] Did I bite him? Perhaps. But in life, you’re either the biter or ze bitter. [normal voice] I’ll tell you this. I have a theory, guys. My theory is this. I think my kids are gonna yell at their kids. I think it skips a generation. And I think at night, my boys are in their bunk bed talking about it and saying, when I grow up, I’m not gonna do that ineffective bullshit Dad does. I’m gonna get loud like Grandpa. And the other was one’s like, oh, totally. I’m not gonna be a beta cuck like Dad. Invalidate your feelings? Bitch, grow up. My wife thinks the world can help us be better parents, and she’s always sending me Instagram videos of Instagram moms who are trying to share their wisdom. My take is if they look too well put together, I just think they have different kinds of kids than ours. Like, if they have a blowout and a Ring light, I’m just like, I don’t think this is meant for us. And they often have very cryptic advice. My wife sent me one where it was a woman just very calmly saying, positive feedback is really important for a child. If you tell your child in the morning that you like their handwriting, they’re less likely to punch a sibling at night. Now, I don’t know if that’s true or not, because I never remember it until it’s too late. Like, they’ll just be wailing on each other in the corner. And I run over, and I’m like, I like your handwriting! There is–there is an Instagram mom I really like, a style of Instagram mom. It’s the one who’s, like, barely keeping it together. And they’re shooting their video like Blair Witch Project style on their phone. And they’re, like, hiding in the closet before their kids can find them. They’re like, hi, I don’t have a lot of time. We figured out a way to get Sharpie off wallpaper. What you have to do is– oh, no, they found me! My wife and I are both incredibly close with our parents, and I think it’s one of the first things we connected on. We thought if we started our own family, maybe we would have kids that wanted to hang out as much with us as we want to hang out with our parents. With that said, our families also have some differences. For example, when I was growing up, the rule at the dinner table was never speak unless spoken to. If you do speak, have it be relevant to the conversation at hand, and certainly never talk until the person who is currently talking has finished, whereas I feel like in my wife’s family, the rule was as soon as you think something, say it out loud. Ideally, try to start saying it before you finish thinking it. Try to hear the completed thought outside your head with your ears for the very first time. Another cool thing my wife’s family does is they will call a restaurant to order delivery, and it’s only when they’re on the phone with the restaurant that they ask everybody else what they want. They will low-key criticize the restaurant on the phone with the restaurant. They’ll be like, should we get the dumplings? And from across the room, someone will be like, no, their dumplings are soggy. We’re not gonna get the dumplings. My wife’s family is Jewish, which I haven’t said yet, but I have told you. If there’s one thing Jewish people agree on, I would love to know what that is. I really want to stress, these jokes are all pro-Semitic. I love my Jewish wife. I love my Jewish children. I have incredible in-laws. The best thing about my in-laws is they’re very easy to find. If you’re ever looking for them, they’re in the middle of my fucking business. Knock. We have a tricky conversation coming up with our children because my wife’s grandparents were Holocaust survivors. And obviously, that’s something we’re going to have to explain to them one day. The problem with kids is sometimes they will ask you a question before you’re prepared on how to answer it, and they sort of force your hand. And the other day, my wife said to one of our sons, you’re so lucky you know all four of your grandparents. Your grandmother didn’t know any of her grandparents. And he said, what happened to them? And she said, they all died in a war. And he said, were they soldiers? And she said, not everyone who dies in a war is a soldier. And then he paused for a second and said, oh. Were they drummers? Because he’d seen a Revolutionary War picture book, and quite smartly, may I say, deduced that while the soldiers are obviously in grave danger, these drummers up front are dead men. What a bad time to be good at drumming, the Revolutionary War. Maybe the worst time ever to be good at drumming. And I bet when you heard word that they were looking for drummers, you got so excited. You’re like, oh, my God, that’s great. We don’t have to fight. We’ll stay back and rehearse for a concert. And then whenever the survivors get here, we’ll do a gig for them. And so they raise their hand. They were like, I know how to drum. And they’re like, great, go strap it on and stand up front. And they were like, up front? And they’re like yeah, it’s gonna be you, another drummer, and a flute guy. And the flute guy was like, actually, it’s a fife. And they’re like, not now, flute guy. My wife argues that I should convert to Judaism. Her argument is everybody already assumes that I’m Jewish– not a bad argument. I’m a quarter Jewish. Every Jewish person I’ve ever met has said, you’re Jewish, right? I’m also a quarter Swedish. Not one Swedish person has ever said, schmorgedy, borgedy, borgedy, borg? That’s how they talk, guys. I’m not gonna apologize for how they talk. Why would “The Muppet Show” lie to me? That’s how Swedish people talk. And this is how lab assistants talk– me, me, me, me, me, me, me. I recently found out some things about my lineage because I did this incredible show on PBS called Finding Your Roots with Professor Henry Louis Gates. It’s a wonderful show, great show. He’s a brilliant man. And I found out some things about my family that I hadn’t known before. I found out I had descended from Lithuanian Jews, Lithuanian Jews, famous for coining the expression, we got to get the fuck out of Lithuania. But I was a bad subject for the show Finding your Roots because I am not easily shocked or amazed. And the best thing about that show is when they reveal information to you about your lineage, and you are shocked and amazed. And because I’m not easily shocked and amazed, it was just a bad episode. Like, for example, at one point, Henry Louis Gates looked at me and said, we tracked down one of your ancestors to the year 1650. We found their name written in a town ledger from the year 1650. How does that make you feel, knowing we tracked back a relative of yours to the year 1650? And all I could manage was, well, I mean, I knew I came from people. It’s not like he was like, your great-great-grandmother was a mermaid. He did shock me once, but it was by accident. You sit across from him, and there’s a table between you, and on the table is a big book full of information, and he tees up the story. And when he tees up the story, he asks you to turn the page to reveal the information. And at one point, he said to me, you’re a performer. And I said, I’m a performer. He said, do you anyone else in your family tree who’s a performer? And I go, I don’t know a single other person in my family tree who is a performer. And he said, why don’t you turn the page? Because I think the next thing you’re gonna see is pretty cool. So I turn the page, and it was a newspaper obituary about my great-grandfather who had died from suicide. And Henry Louis Gates goes, what does it say? And I said, oh, exactly that. I go, my great-grandfather, it seems he died by suicide. And Henry Louis Gates, to his credit, just looked at me and said, that’s a mistake. I apologize. We’re gonna edit this out. And then he said, why don’t you turn another page? So I turned another page, and I’m like, oh, my grandfather was in a school play. And he said, pretty cool, right? And I was like, Henry! You can’t bounce back from accidentally showing someone a suicide obituary. That would be like if a magician was like, is this your card? And you’re like, no, I think that’s a picture of your dick. Oh, fuck. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Is this your card? Nine of spades. Is this your card? You’re still thinking about the dick pic? Yeah! Yeah, dude. This is the time of the night where a lot of comedians will start doing their anti-trans material. I’m happy to inform you I have no anti-trans material. I have nothing but love and respect for the trans community. And also, I’m always so frustrated when people frame it as how it’s inconvenient to them when someone transitions, when they talk about how they have to learn a new name or a new pronoun, or they have to change a contact in their email address folder. And really, if we’re being honest– let’s be honest for a second. What would actually be harder for you, if someone in your life decided they were transitioning to a new gender, or if someone in your life decided that as of tomorrow, they were going to be a vegan? Like, what makes your life harder tomorrow? Because, you guys, five years ago, my brother decided to be a vegan, and I’ve spent multiple Thanksgivings with him, and I 100% would prefer my next Thanksgiving start with my dad walking in and saying, I’m a lady now– Than I would spending another Thanksgiving where my brother keeps asking me, is there butter in this? I’m like, there’s fucking butter in everything. That is the true meaning of Thanksgiving is butter in everything. That’s how the first Thanksgiving started. The Indigenous people came over. They were like, this is maize. And the pilgrims said, what if we put butter on it and call it corn? And the Indigenous people were like, oh, my God, this is so much better. How can we ever repay you? And the pilgrims were like, we have an idea, but we’re not gonna tell you yet. White man. My brother, who’s hardcore– my brother will not eat honey. My brother said that vegans who eat honey are called beegans. I found out he didn’t eat honey because one day, he was over at my apartment, and I just sort of threw a granola bar at him because he looked like he was starving. And… he picked it up, and he just started reading the label. If there was a logo for veganism, it should be someone at your home reading a label. Found a problem! By the way, I wish I could be a vegan. Every argument for being a vegan is a good one. It’s better for the environment. It’s more humane. The best argument, though, is this, you guys. My brother looks so much healthier than I do. Like, if you saw a picture of my brother and I next to each other, you would stop eating meat yesterday. Like, he glows like the sun. And next to him, I look like a guy holding a lantern at the bow of a ferry. I’m like– The fog is thick, but we’ll make it through. I mentioned my in-laws earlier, and I want to give a special– pay a little special attention to my wonderful mother-in-law. I really do have the greatest mother-in-law in the world. And my favorite thing about her is there are also times that she agrees with me that my wife is being a lot. Sometimes my wife and I will be fighting in front of my mother-in-law, and she will just make eye contact with me from across the room as if to say, sorry. But it has to be non-verbal. It is only of value to me if it is a non-verbal acknowledgment of my wife’s behavior. If she actually speaks up in my defense, that’s a disaster for me. Because every married person here knows that it’s always just easiest to agree with your spouse when they’re complaining about something. And I cannot tell you how many times it’s been the end of the night, and we’re getting ready for bed. And my wife will say, can you believe my mom says I have to be nicer to you? And my only response is yeah, what a bitch. Mind your own business, lady. I do have a mean wife. You guys– But only to me. My wife is mean to me, and she is so nice to the kids, and that is so much better than the other way around. If my wife was nice to me but mean to the kids, my life would be a nightmare. I would come home, and they’d always run over and be like, hey man, you got to step in and do something. We’re your kids, too. And I’d be like, shh, don’t talk to me. I don’t want her to know we’re friends. I–by the way, this is not an attack on my wife. This is a defense of her meanness. My wife works so hard. She has three children. She is so depleted. She has a full-time job. My wife is a lawyer. My wife passed the New York Bar. She is a brilliant woman. The New York Bar, that’s the hardest one. That’s the one Giuliani passed. So I get it. She is tired all the time, and she’s so patient with her children. And sometimes she has to take it out on me. And also, I deserve it, you guys. I am so irritating. Here are some of the things I do. Here are some of the things I do that earn her meanness. We’re on our third kid. I still don’t know how to collapse the stroller. No idea. I look at a stroller the way a dog would if you told him to do origami. I have no idea how to fold up the stroller. I’ll just, like, wiggle it. I’ll shake it a little bit. Hey, quick question for the women here. Have you ever, while watching your husband try to collapse the stroller, thought to yourself, I can’t believe I ever thought this man could satisfy me sexually? Like, while he’s like, I think I got it. I almost got it. Are you like, there’s a button? It’s like, no, I think it’s almost there. Just a few more pumps. You want to hear something heartbreaking? The first time my wife heard me tell that joke, hardest she’s ever laughed. She laughed a hurtful amount. She screamed from the audience, amen, brother! Preach! That’s not to say my wife is perfect. There are a few things I would change about her as well. If I could change something about my wife, I would try to improve her skills as a directional speaker. My wife says important things to me all the time with her back to me while she’s walking out of the room without raising her voice at all. She’ll say things like, the gas company was here today. They say there’s a toxic– So we have this fight all the time where she’ll be like, remember, we’re having dinner with the Harrises in an hour. And I’m like, when did you tell me that? And she’s like, Monday, when I whispered it into the mailbox. Another thing I would change about my wife is her caffeinated beverage of choice. My wife’s caffeinated beverage of choice is a matcha latte. If you don’t know what that is, I’ll tell you what it’s not– available at the coffee place you are going to. It’s such a rude thing to ask for when someone’s like, we’re getting coffee, what do you want? It would be like if you’re like, hey, we’re ordering pizza. Can we get you anything? A quiche Lorraine. They’re not gonna have that. It doesn’t hurt to ask. It does hurt to ask. I don’t want to look like a lunatic. I think my wife likes matcha lattes because they are hard to get. And the reason I say that is my wife’s love language is acts of service. Do you guys know the concept of love languages? Here’s the concept of love languages for those of you who don’t know. There are five love languages. This is how people receive love. There’s acts of service, touch, quality time, gifts, and words of encouragement. And, guys, I don’t know who came up with this list. All I know is that their love language is definitely acts of service, because this is the biggest scam ever that acts of service is lumped on this list with the other four reasonable things. Here’s life if your love language is touch and your wife is acts of service. When I get home, I would like a hug. I need you to fix the boiler. Quality time. Want to go for a walk? Yeah, after you clean out the gutters. It’s like if an airline’s loyalty program was like, we have gold, platinum, silver. And when we land, you clean the plane. This is all– what I’ve been doing is all a very good example of how it is hard to be married to a comedian. I just get to come up here and tell you guys what I’m thinking about my marriage. And so, yes, it is hard to be married to a comedian. But, guys, it’s also very hard to be a comedian who is married. And what I mean by that is when you’re married, the right thing to do when you’re having an argument is always say the thing that will most quickly deescalate the situation. But when you’re a comedian, those aren’t the things that pop into your head. When you’re a comedian in the middle of an argument, all you ever think is this is a funny thing I could say that will make it worse. Here’s an example, a recent example. My boys love superheroes, and they’re always asking me questions about superheroes. They’ll say, who would win a fight between Batman and Spider-Man? Who’s stronger, the Hulk or Thor? And the other day, they said, who’s faster, Superman or the Flash? And that’s an age-old comic book question. I was so proud of them for even coming up with it. And I said, you know what, let me check on YouTube. And sure enough, there was a three-minute clip from a “Justice League” cartoon of Superman racing the Flash. And I said, you know what, let’s watch it. Now, the important part of this story is our kids do not have a lot of screen time. I don’t say that to be like, we’re better parents than anyone here. I just mean that our kids will turn out better than yours. So– I got one boy on each knee. And I got my phone out, and we’re watching Superman race the Flash. And my wife walks in, and she says, what are you doing? And I say, we’re watching Superman race the Flash. And she says, a cartoon? And I couldn’t help myself. And I said, no, the real guys. Isn’t that crazy? They got the real guys. And they weren’t even trying to get the real– it was, like, a nature crew documentary in the desert. And then they saw this, like, blue and red voom, voom. And they were like, did we just– I mean, she’d left the room. She’d walked out being like, I can’t believe my mom says I got to be nice to this– Here’s another recent example. We were going on vacation, and we were leaving New York City. And we were going through security. And the TSA agent found a tub of hummus in my wife’s carry-on. And they took it out, and they said, you can’t bring hummus on the plane. And my wife said, I’ve brought hummus on the plane before, which was less convincing than she thought it would be. Because their answer to that was you can’t bring hummus on the plane. And my wife said, but it’s not a liquid. And they said, it’s also not a solid. And it turns out, in cases like this, the tie goes to the TSA agent. And look, I was on my wife’s side. I mean, everybody’s bringing hummus on planes. Why are they singling her out? Every time you go on a plane these days, you walk down the aisle, five, seven tubs of hummus. But they took her hummus. And then we were walking and she was upset. And she said to me, can you believe that? And I said, no, but I didn’t say which part I hadn’t believed. I’d been honest without being truthful. And that would be the end of that story, but we had to fly back to New York. And on the way back, my wife stopped on the way to the airport at a Whole Foods and bought a tub of hummus, same size, if not even a little bit bigger. And they found it again. This time, they found it in the Whole Foods bag, which is what you call asking for it. And they pulled it out, and they said to my wife, you can’t bring hummus on the plane. And she said, I’ve brought hummus on the plane before, conveniently leaving out what had happened the most recent before. And still, they took her hummus. And then we walked through. And we were walking, and I could tell she was upset. And I knew I shouldn’t say anything. I knew the right path forward was just to keep my mouth shut, but I couldn’t help myself. And I turned to her with a big smile and said, well, you’ll get them next time. She is here tonight, by the way. She’s not here. Are you crazy? She’s here, and I’m gonna tell the hummus story we haven’t talked about since? I’ll tell you this. I know my wife. She’s a substantial woman. She’s got grit. She’s got determination. The next time we fly, she’s getting hummus on a plane. I believe in her. I believe she’s gonna get hummus on the plane. She’s gonna go to the airport. She’s gonna unzip her carry-on, and she’s gonna take out a bag of chickpeas and a muddler. And she’s gonna look that TSA agent in the eye and be like, officer, I think everything here is legal and above board. And they’re just gonna nod ’cause they know they’ve lost. And then in deference to her victory, all of the TSA in the airport is gonna stand to make a gate for her to walk through. They’re gonna hold up their magnetic wands like swords. And she’s gonna walk through the airport underneath the magnetic wands. And passengers are gonna scream her name and throw pita chips at her feet like rose petals. And then she’s gonna get on the plane, and we’re gonna sit down. And she’s gonna finish making her concoction, and she’s gonna say to the kids, who wants hummus? And they’re all gonna say, we hate hummus. And I’m gonna whisper, don’t care for. So my kids have never watched my show, but I recently brought my kids to the show because we had our tenth anniversary show, and we had President Joe Biden on the show. Thank you. Very kind. We had President Biden on the show. And I thought, you know what? When’s the next time I’m gonna have my kids be in the position to meet the president? And, you know, I might not want them to meet the next one. So I said, you know what, let’s– let’s bring the kids in to meet the president. And the best thing about watching my kids meet the president is not how the president behaved, but rather how each of my children acted differently based on their personality. First up was my oldest, and my oldest is just– he’s the sweetest boy in the world, and he’s just trying so hard. Like a lot of oldest siblings, he just wants to be the best kid he can be. So anyway, he picked out his outfit, and he wore his nicest clothes from his picture day. And he just walked into the room, and he was like, hello, Mr. President, my name is Ashe. Nice to meet you. And I was just so proud of him. Like, my heart broke at how wonderfully he had performed. Next up was my middle son. He was born in the lobby of an apartment building and behaves like it every day of his life. I don’t–can’t quite explain what that is. I just know that even if you didn’t know who he was, if you saw him across the room, you’d be like, I think that one was born in a lobby. He picked out his outfit as well. He wore a train conductor’s jacket and a pair of Ray-Bans. And he literally danced into the room. And when he danced into the room, my oldest was so embarrassed. He, like, cocked his fist back. And then he remembered that earlier that morning, I told him he had good handwriting, and he was like– So my middle dances in the room and just starts singing. ♪ Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden ♪ And he gets right next to him, and he screams in the president’s face. You’re my “fave-whit” “pwesident!” And Joe Biden was so taken aback because I don’t even think Joe Biden is Joe Biden’s favorite president. He looked at me like, have you not told him about Obama? Because he would– if he likes me, he would love Obama. And then the best, though, was my daughter, Addie, two and a half. And the president was incredible with her. It was really something to see, his sweetness. He sat on the couch so that he was at eye level with her. And she walked over, and he reached into a bag. And he pulled out a stuffed Commander, the White House dog. And he didn’t know this, but in January, I had gone to the White House, and I had left with three stuffed Commanders, and I had given them to my children. But he reached into the bag, and he held it out to Addie. And he went like, [mumbles]. He said, I got this for you. And she just looked at it, and then she looked at him and said, I got that. And he said, you have one of these? And she goes, yeah, I got that at home. And he’s just holding it. And he goes, you want another one? And she goes, no. And I’ve been so worried about that interaction all day because my daughter is a huge Trump supporter, and–and not on social issues. It’s all tax stuff with her. She’s NATO. She feels like the NATO countries don’t pay enough. Don’t get into it with her if you see her. I have a weird thing happening, which is I grew up in the suburbs. All I ever wanted to do was live in New York City. My kids live in New York City. All they want to do is live in the suburbs. Like, we visit my parents. My parents live in the same house I grew up in in a nondescript New Hampshire suburb. And every time we leave, my kids are basically like, when are you gonna make enough money to buy a house like this? Because we live in New York, and nothing about New York makes sense to kids. There’s none of the appeal of New York appeals to them. They’re never like, well, sure, Grandma and Grandpa have a front and back yard, but we can walk to the theater! I have one of those New York City apartments, if you ever lived in New York, you’d be like, this is a great apartment. If you lived anywhere else in the world, you’d be like, I guess so. Here are some of the features about my very expensive New York City apartment. It’s never fully dark. It’s never fully quiet. We live near a university, so every other night at 1:00 in the morning, you hear someone yell something like, Krista says she’ll meet us there! And whoever the Krista news is being yelled at does not hear it the first time. So they’re like, Krista’s not with us! And so then the first person has to be like, no, Krista says she’ll meet us there! And it takes everything in my power not to open up the window and be like, you guys, Krista’s dead! Krista died. It’s, like, so sad, you guys, but she’s dead. Do we have heat in our apartment? Yeah, we have exposed radiators. And the best thing about them is they’re so hot that when you touch it, you don’t burn yourself. You just die. They’re like lava that way, I think. I’ve been told our radiators are the feature of a prewar building. I’m not sure which war they were talking about. They’re not the only prewar feature in our apartment building. We also have a neighbor across the hall who could definitely find Prussia on a map. And much like Prussia after World War II, she also doesn’t have boundaries. The other day, I was trying to get my son out the door to school. And I got him into the hallway, and he was just having one of those rough mornings that kids have. And I got him in the hallway, and then he sort of wrestled his way free of me, and he ran into the apartment. And then I chased him in with his shoes in my hand, and I left the door open. And I finally managed to get him in a chair. And I’m trying to get his shoes on. And I’m upset, and he’s crying. And we’re just having a really bad morning. And then, all of a sudden, we hear– ♪ Hush, little baby ♪\\n♪ Don’t say a word ♪ And we turn around, and our neighbor has just wandered through the open door into our apartment, wearing a nightgown the color of which I would describe as Victorian apparition. Ghost of girl who drowned in town well. And I love that she was in her apartment, and she heard a kid crying, and she goes, I know what calms kids down, the haunted nursery rhymes they sing in horror movie trailers. But there is a very happy ending to that story, and it’s what I’m gonna leave you with, because in that moment when our neighbor walked in, my son and I locked eyes. And I realized he was thinking the exact same thing that I was thinking. Because he looked at her, and then he looked at me, and he said, fuck this. And I said, you just paid for college, buddy! Thank you so much, Chicago! Have a great night!

              " 'tom': ['[“Soul Man” by The Blues Brothers plays] [audience cheering and applauding] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Tom Papa! [cheering and applause increases in intensity] ♪ Good lovin’ ♪ ♪ I got a truckload ♪ ♪ And when you get it ♪ ♪ You got something ♪ ♪ So don’t worry ♪ ♪ ‘Cause I’m coming ♪ ♪ I’m a soul man ♪ Wow. Look at you. Look at you. [audience cheers] [Tom chuckles] DC, thank you so much for coming out. [cheering and applause] So nice. Love this town. It’s hilarious here. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] Keeps getting funnier every year. [Tom and audience laugh] I’m, uh, happy to be here. I’ve been going through some changes at my house. We, uh, dropped off my last daughter, my last child, my youngest, off at college. And they’re all gone now, and nobody tells you how hard it’s gonna be pretending to be sad. [audience laughing] [applause] [cheering and applause] Not one tear. Not one tear. [audience laughs] [laughs] I really thought I was gonna cry. I feel so bad. [audience laughs] But I think I might be happier than I’ve ever been. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] And it’s all right, you know. We did all the things. We did all the things. Look, I love her to death. I love both of them. I love ’em to death. But, you know, we had a good run. It’s over. [audience laughing] They want me to be happy. You don’t want to think your dad’s home, in your empty room, crying his eyes out. You want to think he’s all right, moving on with his life, microdosing, and watching Rick and Morty by himself. [audience laughing] That’s what I’m doing. [laughs] Yeah. [audience cheering] Yeah. Because I have freedom now. I never had freedom before. When I was little, I don’t know if you’re like me, but when I was a child, they made me live with my parents. [audience laughing] And I couldn’t drink stuff or smoke stuff ’cause they were always around. And then when I got away from them, I made my own family. Nobody tells you, when you have kids, your children become your new parents. [audience laughs] And you can’t drink stuff or smoke stuff because they’re always around. And they can’t keep a secret. [audience laughing] But now, for the first time, they’re all gone, and I’m doing all the stuff. [audience laughs] I can have martinis in the middle of the afternoon. [audience cheers] Yes. [cheering and applause] Because I know no one’s gonna call me out of the blue and ask for a ride home from karate. [audience laughs] [laughs] There were a lot of years I did very questionable driving at 4:00 in the afternoon. [deep breath] “I got her. I’ll get them.” [audience laughing] [sighs] I don’t even wear clothes there anymore. [audience laughs] What’s the point? My wife leaves for work in the morning, pants off. The dogs are so happy. They’re like, “You’re one of us now.” “Ah!” [audience laughing] [laughs] Rolling around in the backyard, my dog’s just looking at me. “Rub your ass on this tree. It’s amazing.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] And she’s right. It is. [audience laughing] It’s a special tree. [Tom and audience laugh] But I’ll be honest with you, folks. I’ll be honest. It almost killed us. It almost killed us. Raising kids is no joke. It’s no joke. If you don’t have children, people approach you all the time very flippantly. “When are you gonna do it? You should have kids.” “When are you gonna have kids?” No. You should think long and hard about whether you’re gonna have kids. You should have seen me before this experiment. [audience laughs] I was skinny. I had long curly hair. [audience laughing] And I could see. I could see. [audience laughing] I used to have eyes like an eagle. Now I have eyes like a crab. [audience laughing] My wife and I are just husks. We’re just brittle husks of what we were. We’ll be in the kitchen some days. She’ll be like, “We could fool around right here. No one would ever know.” I’m like, “Yeah, we could.” [audience laughing] “Or we could just lie down on this cold floor for a while and shut our eyes.” “It’s really nice down here.” “We’re not dying. We’re just resting.” [audience laughing] I really can’t see anymore. Not all the time. Just when I’m driving at night with other cars around. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] There’s a lot coming at me. It’s like a fireworks display out there. I’m like, “I guess I’ll just aim for the dark part in the middle.” [audience laughing] Mistaking a lot of garbage cans for people at night. “Oh!” [audience laughing] [laughs] “Why is everybody out tonight?” [audience laughing] “They’re not. It’s just recycle day. You’re all right.” You’ve just got to get smart with it. You have to adapt. I’m using the curbs now. [audience laughing] [laughs] That’s why they’re there. I just ricochet my way back to the house. [audience laughing] [Tom chuckles] But it is a real treat. It is. Like, I can go back to being who I was before all of this. You know? When you have kids, you have to pretend you’re Superman. You have children looking for protection. And you don’t have new skills. They just kicked you out of the hospital. “Good luck.” No instructions. You know? And… and I wasn’t Superman. And now that they’re older, I can admit, I’m just a guy. And they know now that they’re lucky to be alive. [audience laughing] A lot of times, when I was a young father, I wanted to cry. But you can’t, you know? I didn’t want my kids coming home from school, seeing me at the kitchen table, just sobbing. [sobs] “Dad, what’s wrong?” “Everything! Everything!” [audience laughing] “I can’t figure any of this out.” [audience laughing] “I don’t have any money. Do you have money?” [audience laughing] “I saw a birthday card on the counter. Don’t lie to me.” [audience laughing] [Tom chuckles] You can’t be honest with them when they’re little. “Dad, are there really monsters?” “I don’t know. Probably.” [audience laughing] “I feel it sometimes. Don’t you feel it?” [audience laughing] “Sometimes I think I hear it.” “Do you ever hear them in the attic? What is that?” [audience laughing] [laughing] You can’t say that. When they come to breakfast, “Thank God you’re alive! I didn’t think you were gonna make it.” [audience laughing] “I thought I heard chewing last night. I thought it was you.” [audience laughing] Now I can be honest. You know? I don’t like the dark. I tell them. No, I don’t like the dark. I don’t think anyone likes the dark. You don’t like the dark. No, it’s scary. In our utility room, we have this door that’s on a spring. As soon as you get in off the garage, where we store all the stuff. And the door closes automatically as soon as you get in there. But the switch is on the opposite wall in these shelves. And it’s too long. It’s too far. You can’t… I can’t keep it open with my foot, so you got to nail it. And you go for it. Sometimes there’s an Easter basket, or… ah! [audience laughing] And it closes, and it’s dark. Oh! Whatever has been chasing me my whole life is like, “Gotcha!” [audience laughing] I couldn’t admit that when they were little. I’d tuck in these two little girls, these two beautiful angels. “Good night, girls. I’ll see you in the morning.” “Good night, Dad.” “Can you keep the light on? It’s scary in the dark.” “No, no, no.” [audience laughing] “Come on. There’s nothing to be afraid of.” “I’ll see you in the morning.” [audience laughing] Then I run to my room and turn everything on. [audience laughing] [breathing heavily] ‘Cause it’s scary in the dark, and I knew it was scary, because I could hear their whimpering down the hallway. [audience laughing] For hours. [cheering and applause] We did one of those DNA tests before they left. [audience laughing] I highly recommend it. I really do. I really do. I know it’s a little sketchy, ’cause you gotta give your DNA away to a corporation. And they’re not gonna do anything great with it, for sure. No, they’re definitely gonna clone us in the future. But who cares? We’ll be dead. I think it’s kind of exciting. Right? A bunch of us fighting robots in the future. That’s exciting, right? Six of you running through a wheat field, with no private parts. [groaning] “Ah!” [audience laughing] Long hair like you never had. [moans] “Ah!” Learning karate and eating squirrel meat. It’s exciting! [laughter] But in the short-term, not only do you find out your family heritage, I expected that, but you also find out all your family secrets. I wasn’t expecting that. That’s very exciting. All the secrets come out when DNA shows up. There’s no hiding it. DNA is like the drunk uncle who comes to Christmas for the first time. He’s like, “Wait a minute. You think that’s your real dad?” [audience laughing] “Have I got a story for you!” [audience laughs] We knew, in my family, we were gonna be mostly Italian, and a little German that we don’t talk about. [audience laughing] When it came back, we were mostly Italian, a little German, and a little French. A little French thrown in. I called my mother. I said, “What’s with the French?” She said, “Oh, secret’s out!” “Your grandmother was a whore.” [audience roaring with laughter] [audience member] Whoo! “I’m sorry. What did you call Nana?” [audience laughing] “Yep, she was a whore, all right. Slept her way through Europe.” “That’s why you have weird eyebrows and your uncle’s gay.” [audience laughing] I don’t think that’s how it works. [audience laughs] No more secrets. No more secrets. DNA and social media. You know, I tour all over the country. People do their research, and they show up once in a while. “I think we’re related.” And I’ll call my mother. “Who’s Holly?” “What do you know?” [audience laughing] “I know there’s a middle-aged woman in Tampa who wants to come to Thanksgiving.” “And she looks a lot like Dad!” [audience laughing] “Oh, shit. She found us.” [audience laughing] Families had secrets, for generations. Long, deep secrets. Families kept secrets. Anything that embarrassed them in front of the neighbors, anything they didn’t understand, that made them uncomfortable, they would just lie about it or stick it in the attic. Just stick it in the attic. Unwanted baby? Put it in the attic. [audience laughing] Undiagnosed ADHD? Get her in the attic. “Is that your boy with a stutter?” “What boy?” Put him in the attic. [audience laughing] All over America, kids looking out of attic windows. “Where’s everybody g-g-g-g-going?” [audience laughing] “I want a b-b-backpack too!” [audience laughing] [Tom chuckles] It’s so sad. And as a child, if you had an inkling about a family secret, and you asked the elders about it, they’d lie right to your face. “Who’s that man living in the garage?” “What man?” [audience laughing] “There’s a man out there. He’s been there for quite some time.” “There’s no man out there.” “Yes, there is.” “Shut up!” [audience laughing] What a great time to be a parent, by the way. Could you imagine? There was a time you could tell your kids to shut up, right to their face. [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] No long conversations. No explanations. Just “shut up!” [audience laughs] How much easier would that have been? [audience laughs] “Why is the sun hot?” “I don’t know. Why don’t you shut up?” [audience laughing] “Well, that was uncalled-for.” [audience laughs] Even easier to be a father back then. You weren’t even considered one of the parents. [audience laughing] You just had to show up and hit everyone once in a while. [audience laughing] My father would act like we were strangers who just broke into the TV room. “Where the hell did these kids come from? Get them out of here!” My mother would come. “Leave your father alone. He works hard.” “We were just playing.” “Well, now you’re just shutting up.” [audience laughs] [Tom chuckles] It was a different time. We had an uncle who couldn’t take it anymore. He just stood up in the middle of dinner and just walked out the front door. And didn’t come back. Just left my aunt and my cousins behind. And just left. We were like, “Where’s Uncle Bob?” And they lied right to our face. They said he went to Siberia. [audience laughing] He wasn’t in Siberia. He went to his girlfriend’s apartment in the same town and lived there for two years. In the same town. We’d see him around. [audience laughing] We’d be in the supermarket. “Is that Uncle Bob?” [audience laughs] “No, that son of a bitch is in Siberia.” [audience laughing] “Looks a lot like Uncle Bob.” “Looks like you’re gonna shut the hell up.” [laughter and applause] [Tom chuckles] And then one day, he just walked back in, sat down, and kept eating. [audience laughs] Like nothing ever happened. We were like, “How was Siberia?” He was like, “That wasn’t her name.” [audience roars with laughter] [applause] [cheering and applause] [Tom chuckles] Things are better now. I think with the truth coming out, things are better. We’re actually helping people, not sticking things in the attic anymore. We’re dealing with mental health, helping each other out. It’s a much nicer time. Everyone’s going to therapy. Good for you. If you need someone to talk to and you go to therapy, good for you. I’m not going, but good for you! [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] I’m not right. There’s a lot needs to be fixed. But I’m having a good time. And I know if I go to therapy, they’re gonna stop it. [audience laughing] [applause] [cheering and applause] [Tom laughs] I know what’s wrong with me. I eat too much, and I drink too much. “Don’t you want to find out why?” [chuckles] I know why. Life is hard, and that stuff’s fun to do. [audience laughing] [chuckles] We all got stuff. Everyone’s dealing with stuff. Everybody in here’s got something. I still shoplift. [surprised laughter] [laughing] I do. You should do it too. It’s fun. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] You know when you’re a kid and you steal? I never got caught, and I’m still going. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’m undefeated. [audience laughing] Not big stuff. I’m not an ass. Little stuff, like dental floss and candy. Stuff like that. Stuff we shouldn’t have to pay for in the first place. [laughs] You know what I mean? Pens? I’m not paying for pens. I’m not giving you money for pens. I steal pens. CVS, Walgreens… You. If we’re hanging out, I would get your pen. [audience laughing] Try it. It’s really fun. Especially as an adult, they don’t really mess with you. Some 16-year-old manager of a CVS sees you sticking a Blow Pop in your pocket. “I don’t have time for this shit!” [audience laughing] [sighs] “Call the cops on my principal? This is ridiculous.” [audience laughing] The older I get, the more I’m gonna steal, for sure. [audience laughs] Oh yeah, when I’m 80, that’s all I’m gonna do. [audience laughs] Wake up in the morning, have coffee, go to Best Buy and roll that place. [audience laughing] “He’s back! What’s he got this time? Looks like a PlayStation.” [audience laughing] [applause] “Should we take it back?” “No, follow him to his car.” “He falls asleep before he turns it on. He’ll be all right.” [audience laughing] [Tom chuckles] Oh. Helping kids now, that’s better, you know? Helping kids out, that’s a good thing. When people have little problems, great teachers are helping them out. We didn’t have that. When I was a kid, we didn’t have great teachers. They were a hot mess. They had no answers for us. They just called me hyper. That’s what they would tell my parents. Every back-to-school night. “This kid’s hyper.” “He talks all day and makes friends in the middle of class.” Oh! We got to stop that shit immediately. [audience laughs] [laughs] They would show up, adjust their wigs, do a shot of Jack Daniel’s, and throw shit at us. [audience laughs] They were always throwing stuff at us. Erasers, chalk… My best friend got hit in the head with a dictionary. Yeah, right in his head. We didn’t need Adderall. We were focused. [audience laughing] [applause] [laughs] Our lives depended on it. We had a Spanish teacher. She used to come in so hungover, there was a 50% chance her boobs would pop out. [audience laughing] [laughs] We were focused. [audience laughing] Muy bien! Muy bien! [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] If you do go to therapy, just know, you’re gonna go forever. You gotta go forever. Because we don’t get fixed. There’s no fixing this. I’ve never had a friend come up, “Last day of therapy. I’m all better now.” [audience laughing] [laughs] It doesn’t work like that. We’re not… We’re physical beings. We’re constantly changing, constantly changing, evolving, and decaying. That affects you physically, and that affects your emotions, minute to minute, second to second. You can’t pay that much attention to yourself. We’re an ongoing project. Sometimes I really think my whole emotional makeup is completely dependent on what I ate that day. Ever had one of those days? “Cool Ranch Doritos? I haven’t had those in a while.” [munching] And a half hour later, I’m like, “I think I’m gonna kill myself.” [audience laughing] “Why are my eyes hot? I feel weird.” [audience laughing] Always changing. I don’t know any of you, but I know for a fact, you’re slightly different now than when we started the show. Right? The weed’s wearing off. [audience laughs] The alcohol’s kicking in. Some of you didn’t get a chance to eat and you’re all cranky. Some ate too much. Now you’re all gassy and offending your neighbors. [audience laughs] Some of you are jammed in the middle. You thought about peeing? You really should have peed. You really should have peed. [audience laughs] [Tom laughs] We’re not supposed to be happy all the time. Don’t put pressure on yourself. Don’t feel like you’re less than because you’re not happy all the time. That’s a lie. That’s a social media construct. We’re not supposed to be happy all the time. Happy’s like a coke spike. It’s like way up there. You know? No one’s happy all the time. Clowns are happy all the time, and they freak everybody out. [audience laughing] Walking around with permanent smiles. ‘Cause they’re killing things at night and thinking about it during the day. [audience laughing] We’re not supposed to be happy all the time. Happy’s way up here. Joyful, you should be joyful. But that’s down here. That’s down here. Joy is right down there. And depressed, right under it. [audience laughing] Right there. Right there. So close to joy, and all day long, just “Zim, zam, zim, zam, zim.” [exclaims] “Zim, zam, zim.” [audience laughing] There’d be no comedy if we were happy all the time. We wouldn’t be here right now. This is how it works. You come in, we laugh for a couple of hours. As soon as it’s done, right back to Shitsville! [audience laughing] [laughs] Yeah. That’s what I called your life. Shitsville. [applause] [Tom laughs] It’s all right. I live there too. [audience laughs] [Tom laughs] Not supposed to be happy all the time. Think about all the paintings in all the great museums of all the great people who came before us, right? Queen Elizabeth, Joan of Arc, Washington, Jesus. Not one smile. You ever notice that? No one is smiling. There’s no paintings of Lincoln and his bros, like… [audience laughing] One famous smile, the Mona Lisa, and it’s a shit smile. [audience laughing] That’s the kind of smile you give to someone when they get on your elevator at the last minute. [audience laughing] [applause] “Couldn’t wait? Couldn’t wait? Okay.” “Now you’re pressing all the buttons. Great. Nice to have you.” [audience laughing] Sometimes you just need perspective, to know that you’re doing all right. You know? I go to shitty bars. You ever do that? Every town’s got one. Do it. Do it. You know the bar I’m talking about. It’s weird, no windows. There’s just one porthole on the door. You never see anyone go in or out. The door has padding on it, for some reason. Go in there. Go in there in the middle of the afternoon and buy drinks for the 80-year-old guy sitting at that little crummy bar, under the saddest Christmas lights of all time. They’ve been hanging there since 1937. [audience laughs] Buy that guy some drinks. No one knows his name. They call him Popeye, but nobody really knows his name. Listen to his stories. How he fought in every war, lost money in every recession, has every STD known to man. After an hour of that, you come back out into the light. You’re like, “I think I can do this.” [audience laughing] [exhales] “I’m gonna be all right.” [cheering and applause] It’s hard to feel good. It’s hard to feel good. I don’t feel that great right now. Do you? I’m having a great time, but I don’t feel good. Do you feel good? No. Yeah. You feel fat. We all feel fat. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] Yeah. Not fat, puffy, puffy. Definitely puffy. [audience laughs] We could totally pee this out. Don’t you think? We could totally pee it. It’s just water weight. Water mixed with adult chicken fingers, and mac and cheese bites, and ice cream we eat standing up in the kitchen when our family’s asleep. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] No, you don’t need me calling you fat. You know what’s wrong with you. [audience laughing] Might not be fat, might not be fat, but there’s something. There’s something you don’t like about you. We all carry it. I don’t know what it is, but you’re thinking about it right now. Maybe you got weird love handles. Maybe a misshapen nipple. I’ve seen a lot of those. The one that keeps wandering off to the right for no reason. Everybody’s looking this way, and she keeps going over there. [audience laughing] A lot of feet. A lot of feet out there. A lot of feet. It’s feet season out there. I see ’em at the airport. A lot of bad feet out there. A lot of middle-aged women seem to be evolving right before our eyes, growing extra toes in real time. You ever see that? Next to the big toe, there’s a jut that comes out at the side. [imitates a monkey whooping] [audience laughing] Looks like it comes in handy at home, you know, raking the leaves, and… [audience laughing] …returning emails, and talking on the phone at the same time. [audience laughing] You’re in public now. How about some socks? [audience laughing] We torture ourselves. It’s our brains. I think our brain’s main objective is to collect insults hurled at us throughout our life, store them, and play them over and over in a loop until we’re dead. [audience laughs] And even then, I bet it doesn’t stop. I bet it doesn’t stop. I bet I’ll be looking at myself in the coffin at the end, “Oh, I am disgusting. Look at me.” [audience laughs] “Why’d they put me in that tracksuit? I never wore that.” “How could I be dead and still look sweaty? I’m the worst.” [audience laughing] Most of these insults, by the way, this weird, little, low self-esteem you have every once in a while, that’s from insults long ago. This isn’t fresh stuff. This is how long your brain has held on to it. No one insults you as an adult. When’s the last time in the supermarket, someone rolls up, “Nice waddle, fat ass”? [audience laughing] Standing behind you at the register. “You look poor.” [audience laughing] “I’m shopping for my family.” [audience laughing] [laughs] It was when you were little, when you first went to school all excited. “So long, everyone. I’m going to kindergarten.” And you walked into school all excited, and the other kids came running up, “You smell like ham.” [audience laughing] “Why would you say that? I’m here to color and make friends.” Thirty years later, walking through your house, “I’m not getting that promotion. Everyone knows I smell like ham.” [audience laughing] “They’re gonna give it to Donna. Everyone loves Donna.” “She smells like cookies.” [audience laughing] Only our brains, by the way. Only our brains. Other animals don’t have this problem. Your dog doesn’t have low self-esteem. Your dog doesn’t call himself a piece of garbage, even while he’s eating out of the garbage. [audience laughing] He doesn’t sit on the couch afterwards and beat himself up. “What is wrong with me?” [audience laughing] “I have got to get my act together.” “I told everyone on New Year’s Eve, ‘no more garbage’.” [audience laughing] “I said it in front of a room full of people.” “They left that door open a crack. I lost my shit back there.” [audience laughing] “I can’t go for a walk looking like this.” [audience laughing] No, your dog eats the garbage, sits on the couch, “Thank you. I see what you did for me.” [audience laughing] “Thank you. I love you too.” “I ate it all. I ate it all.” “I even ate the bag. Yes, I did.” [audience laughing] “Yes, I did. You know why? Because I’m a good boy.” [audience laughing] “Yes, I am. I’m a good…” [mimics retching] “Oh, I’m sorry.” [audience laughing] “Oh God, I threw it up. I’m so sorry.” “Are you gonna clean that up? No, no, no.” “I’m gonna eat that too.” [audience roars with laughter] [applause] “You do for me, I do for you.” [audience laughing] “I think there’s an avocado pit stuck in my ass.” [audience laughing] “Don’t worry. We’ll deal with it on Wednesday when you’re late for work.” “Don’t worry about it now.” [audience laughing] Got to be more like your dog. Treat yourself like your dog treats themselves. Really. Cut yourself some slack. You know? Don’t be so hard on yourself. What’s the objective here, friends? What is it? To look amazing? No, it’s to stay alive. That’s it. Just stay alive. That’s all you gotta do. And you’re here tonight, so you did it. Congratulations. [cheering and applause] [Tom chuckles] Well… [Tom laughs] I don’t know if it really necessitates applause, really. [audience laughs] [laughs] It’s a lot of momentum at this point, isn’t it? [laughing] Yeah. It turns out it’s not that hard to stay alive. All these close calls you’ve had in your life, and you’re still going. You’re still going. Constantly. Just constant close calls. And every time there is a close call, everyone else thinks it’s hilarious, don’t they? “Dude, that bus was this close!” [Tom laughs] [audience laughing] “Dude, how long were you under the raft at the pool party? Oh my God!” [audience laughs] Constantly choking on stuff. I once got a Pachinko ball stuck in my brain. Know what Pachinko is? It’s like pinball, but with these little ball bearings. And when I was a kid, I realized the ball bearing fit perfectly in my nose. I thought, “This will be hilarious. I’ll put one in this nostril.” “Then I’ll close this nostril and shoot it at my friend’s face.” [audience laughing] Good joke. I got it all set up, and then I realized how funny it was gonna be, and I inhaled. [audience laughing] I don’t know where it went. [audience laughing] It was a weird trip to the emergency room. “Get it out!” It was so embarrassing. “He thinks he’s funny. Tell him what you did.” “Tell him what you did.” [whimpers] [audience laughing] “Just get it out.” A lot of close calls. We’re always electrocuting ourselves. Constantly. How many times have you, like, “bzz, bzz.” Everywhere you go. Why is it we all know what batteries taste like? [audience laughing] [laughs] Because we’re stupid, and we’re lucky to be here. [audience laughing] I had a college roommate. This guy used to drink grain alcohol straight, and then he’d light his farts in front of everybody. Nightly. Nightly. Even that guy is still alive. [audience laughing] [laughs] He is. He’s a lawyer in Phoenix. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] People come to him with their problems. They have no idea he’s just a twitchy brain stem in a suit. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] I’m surprised we’re alive from all the food we eat in this country. Oh my God! We have a good time, but we don’t eat well. We’re the only country that has a nationwide hot-dog-eating contest. Hot-dog-eating contest. A hot dog is the worst thing you can put in the human body. They’ve done studies that every hot dog you eat takes 30 minutes off of your life. That should be a national emergency. [audience laughs] Does it stop us? Hell no! Instead, we have a contest and put it on ESPN on the 4th July, to shine a light on the best and brightest of us all. [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] [Tom laughs] We feed them to our children at the barbecue. We yell, “You get off that trampoline, put out your cigarette, and eat this hot dog.” [audience laughing] “Show some respect.” But who cares, right? Thirty minutes off your life. It’s not like it comes off tonight. [audience laughs] It’s not like you eat the hot dog today and lose it this evening. No, it’s at the end, when it’s weird and scary. So you’re telling me, with every hot dog I eat, I have 30 minutes less of staring at a wall in a nursing home. [audience laughing] Waiting for a stranger to change me. [audience laughing] Sounds to me like hot dogs are a superfood. [audience laughing and cheering] [cheering and applause] [Tom laughs] Seems like we should be eating hot dogs with every meal. [laughs] They should redo that food pyramid and put a hot dog on top. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] I know there’s pressure. I know there’s pressure. There’s always a lot of pressure. I don’t want to make you feel bad about yourself, or add to your feelings of low self-esteem. You’re beautiful. You’re all beautiful. You really are. You’re miracles. This is insane that we’re here in this moment at all. That somehow, all this stardust in this vast, crazy universe somehow came together and cobbled together you! You’re a miracle, and you’re sitting next to another miracle. We’re all miracles. I know it’s hard to think that sometimes. When you stop at 7-Eleven around midnight on your way home. [audience laughing] Not exactly crawling with miracles. [audience laughing] It looks like a lot of mistakes. [audience laughing] [laughs] That’s okay. They’re miracles too. They’re just making weird choices, that’s all. No, you’re all beautiful. I’m attracted to all of you right now. Mostly ’cause you’re covered up. Let’s be honest, right? Everyone’s got their own style. Everyone looks great. A couple hours from now, we peel these layers off… [groans] Oy-he-he-he. [audience laughs] Different story. A lot of weird dangly bits. Strange Jack and the Beanstalk hairs coming out of your ass. Things growing on your body you didn’t think grew on a human. “Is that a barnacle? What am I?” [audience laughing] “What am I, a boat?” I don’t like seeing myself naked, honestly. I come out the shower. I’m the only one in the bathroom. I catch myself in the mirror. “Oh!” [audience laughs] I towel up immediately, like a fancy lady, from tits to thighs. [audience laughing] Like a pig in a blanket, with one soft serve towel on top. [audience laughing] My nipples used to be up here. [audience laughing] They were here. I saw a picture of me in high school. They were here. They’re here now. They’re here. Really, they were here. They’re now down… I’m touching them right now. They’re here. [audience laughing] It’s like they quit and walked off the job. [audience laughing] No two weeks’ notice. Just flipped over the desk, gave me the finger, and made a run for it. And they’re still on the move. They’re still on the move. I never catch ’em, but they’re moving. They’re like two ex-cons in a wheat field. [audience laughing] When I’m 80, they’re gonna be in my pockets. [audience laughing] It’s hard to feel good about yourself, especially with social media. Every time you open up your phone, there’s some people that look great. They’re always calling you a loser, because you don’t live like them, right? You get all these cold plunge people on your feeds. You get these jackasses. Act like you’re a loser if you don’t start off at 6:00 a.m. in a bucket of ice water. Shut the hell up. Get off of my phone. I’m gonna do a video about the benefits of a long hot shower. That’s a winner, where you just keep making it hotter and hotter and hotter, and then you stay an extra 15 minutes, and you come out like a wet noodle, and cancel all your appointments for the day. That’s a winner. [cheering and applause] [Tom laughs] All these guys always showing me their abs. They’ve always got their shirt off where it should be on. Like at a school or a bus stop. “You want abs like these?” [chuckles] “No, honestly.” What am I gonna do with those abs? Nothing. They’re not gonna help my life at all. I’m not impressed by those guys. I feel bad for those guys. I know they’re alone. They have to be alone. You can’t live with another person and have abs like that, doing crunches under the coffee table 24 hours a day. When they’re trying to watch their shows. No one’s gonna stand for that. No, they live alone in a one-bedroom apartment with a pull-up bar, eating protein shakes, and shitting like a goat. [audience laughing] They don’t impress me. You impress me. People who live with other people in a family. That’s impressive. You think abs can do what you do? Get a whole family ready for school on a Tuesday morning in the dark? Making individual breakfasts for every needy bastard in your house? ‘Cause God forbid they eat the same thing on the same damn day. They never do that. And then feed all the animals at the same time? And clean what pops out the other side of them almost immediately? [audience laughs] Then drop them all off at school. Then pick them up at the end of the day, 20 minutes later. [audience laughing] Then drive them around like you’re their Uber driver the rest of the afternoon, taking them to all their dumb activities they can’t even do. [audience laughing] No way. You think abs is gonna sit in a little chair at a dentist’s office? Flipping through a sticky magazine, just waiting for the dentist to come out and give you a $5,000 bill? [audience laughs] A $5,000 bill, because the little bastard stopped brushing his teeth. [audience laughing] And you knew it. You knew it. You knew he wasn’t brushing his teeth. But you stopped asking, because you didn’t want to ruin bedtime every night. You got tired of being the bad guy. You checked the brush, you checked the brush, and it was wet, but that was a lie. [audience laughing] [applause and cheering] That was a lie. [laughs] That was a con job. He was wetting his brush, sitting on the toilet, probably looking at porn on his phone. [audience laughing] And now you have a $5,000 bill. [audience laughing] But as crazy as that house is, you know, and costly, I would much rather live with all those heartbeats, all those needy heartbeats, than live alone with my abs. You know? ‘Cause on some level, your family has to be grateful. They’ll never say thank you. They’ll never say, “Thanks for keeping us alive.” But that’s literally what you’re doing. You’re literally keeping them alive. Without you, they’re dead. They’re dead. [audience laughing] I could leave my daughters with a can and a can opener, come back 24 hours later, dead! [audience laughing] Dead. They’ll never say thank you, so don’t wait for it. Gotta draw it out of ’em. When you see them tomorrow, “My friend last night told me to remind you, without me, you’re dead!” “Or worse, no teeth. You’d have no teeth.” “Like a jack-o’-lantern in December.” [audience laughing] “Going to school with a smushed-in face…” [audience laughing] “…wishing you were dead.” [audience laughing] “So you’re welcome.” [audience laughs] No, so I block all those people on Instagram. I don’t have those guys on my Instagram feed. The only thing on my feed are bakers. That’s it. Just bakers. I love baking bread. I can’t stop baking. [cheering and applause] I love it. My whole algorithm is nothing but bread. Bread and babies. That’s all I got. My favorite guy… Oh, you’d love him. He’s two feet tall. He’s five feet wide. He’s just a French baker. He’s just one ab. He’s just… [audience laughs] He’s just one buttery ab. And he bakes croissants. That’s all he does. He bakes croissants. He puts them in the oven, bakes them, breaks them out, cracks them open. Steam comes out. Then he eats them on camera, and I get aroused. [audience laughing] Food is my love language, or my family’s love language. That’s how we all communicate, through food. My mom would make salami sandwiches for me every day for school. That’s how I could tell how much she loved me at the moment. If I got one salami sandwich, not that great. If I got three, I was a good boy. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] They used to call me Tommy Salami. That’s how many salami sandwiches I’d eat. They just visited me, my parents. Oh my God. I love ’em to death. But two weeks, they came to my house. No hotel, two weeks. Didn’t ask, just showed up. [audience laughs] Two weeks! That’s not a visit. That’s an insurrection. [audience laughing] Man. My father is so cheap. He picked the date they had to be there, and the one before and after it, until it was cheap enough, and then he bought the tickets. I would have paid. I would have paid. [audience laughing] I would have paid for the flight, or a hotel, or a sniper. [audience laughing] [Tom chuckles] I love ’em to death. Don’t get me wrong. I love ’em to death. It’s a blessing to have your parents. It really is. But, oh my God, it’s a lot. [audience laughs] My mother was, like… She was so cute. She’s like, “Don’t worry.” “We’re not gonna be a bother. We’re just gonna hang around.” “It’s not even gonna be like we’re there. You don’t have to entertain us.” “We just want to be around.” “All right.” Yeah, right. I’d try to sneak into the kitchen, early in the morning, get one cup of coffee before it all starts. They’re just sitting there at the counter, like two lonely sea lions. [audience laughing] [wails] [audience laughing] [wails] They’ve been waiting since 4:00 in the morning. [audience laughing] [wails] “We didn’t know when you were gonna get up.” [wails] [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] When people stay with you, there’s no activity that eats up enough hours of the day. You take them to the beach. “There’s the ocean.” “All right, back to the house.” “Twelve more hours till bedtime.” [groans] [audience laughing] [chuckles] The problem is, they have no activities, they have no hobbies. They don’t crossword-puzzle, they don’t pickleball, Sudoku, nothing. They’re just two Italian parents who eat. They just eat and then talk about what they ate last night. And they talk about what they’re gonna eat tonight, and is there time to eat in between? They’re like two retired raccoons just going through my kitchen. [audience laughing] My mother was dumpster diving under the kitchen sink, looking for scraps. “There’s still meat on this chicken bone.” “I don’t know why you threw that out, Mr. Big Shot.” [audience laughing] My father was talking to me, eating a cookie. He dropped it by mistake, stepped on it, peeled it off the bottom of his shoe, and ate it! [audience laughing] Right in front of me! [audience laughs] I was like, “What are you doing?” He looked at me like a toddler who knows he’s in trouble but doesn’t know why. [audience laughing] I’m like, “No shoe cookies! No shoe cookies!” [audience laughing] “Why are you eating a shoe cookie right now?” He’s like, “That? No, come on. I beat it. Five-second rule. I beat it.” It’s not how it works. If you drop a cookie in the toilet, you don’t get to eat it if you’re quick. [audience laughing] [laughs] I love ’em to death. Look, I know it’s a complicated relationship. If you’re lucky enough to still have your parents around, it’s a blessing. But I know you feel guilty a lot of the times. Because sometimes they call, you don’t pick up. Then when you do pick up, you get impatient, because they can’t use the phone. You say something mean before you hang up. I know you feel guilty a lot of the times. But don’t, don’t, because I got news for you. They’re not saying great things about you either. [audience roaring with laughing] [applause and cheering] I guarantee you my father was in the guest room at night, “We’ve gotta get the hell out of here.” “Mr. Big Shot won’t let me eat shoe cookies.” [audience laughing] “Who the hell does he think he is?” “I got you one, by the way, if you want.” [audience laughing] “A little nightcap.” [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] And now it’s putting family in perspective for me. Now that my kids are leaving, I’m gonna be them. I’m gonna be them. You know? I’m gonna wanna just hang around. I’m gonna want my kids to like me, and all that kind of stuff. [sighs] I love family. It’s a great thing. I come from a big family. I love family. But it’s a heartbreaker at the same time. You’re gonna get your feelings hurt. You can’t have that much love without getting your heart broken. It’s the same as when people buy those big dogs. I never understand these people. They get these giant dogs. They’re all filled with fur and love. And they take over the whole house. And everyone falls in love with them. And they’re dead in three months. [audience laughs] I couldn’t take that heartbreak. I need something small and shitty that’s just gonna twitch and pee on itself for 25 years. [audience laughing] Losing limbs, one at a time. Eyes popping out. “I’m still with you, Tommy. I’m still with you.” [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] I have a friend that just got a Great Dane. Are you high? [audience laughing] A Great Dane? That dog should come with a shovel. [audience laughing] Couldn’t handle it. It’s the same with the kids. They take up the whole house. And then, before you know it, they’re on their way out. They don’t remember the first five years you did that stuff for them. They have no memory of it. Then the last four years, they’re trying to get away. So you get, what, eight years in the middle? I’m not sure it’s worth it. [audience laughing] I told my daughter before she left, “Just so you know, I did all of this for you.” “I did all of this for you.” “I didn’t want this house. I didn’t want to live in this town.” “I didn’t want any of these animals.” “I don’t even have friends anymore. All my friends are your friends’ parents.” [audience laughing] “I did this all for you, and now you’re gonna go?” “I should go.” [audience laughing] “You can have it all.” [cheering and applause] “Just give me a backpack with a Van Halen CD and some weed.” “And I’ll go back to living the life I was living before I met you.” [cheering and applause] Oh, but I love ’em so much. So funny. You don’t really plan your life, do you? It just kind of unfolds. It just kind of happens. You have a couple of ideas, but it just kind of happens. I didn’t know I’d be at this point in my life, talking about this family. It just happened. I just got tired of eating pizza by myself. I was eating pizza by myself all the time. “This is getting depressing.” I was eating pizza by myself when I saw a pretty girl. I was like, “You want to eat pizza with me?” [audience laughs] She was like, “Yeah. I’m always eating pizza by myself.” “Me too. Let’s eat pizza together.” “Okay.” [munching] [audience laughing] Then five years later, we’re going through the airport, through security, with a naked toddler and a cat carrier, breaking down a stroller with our feet at 6:00 a.m., sweating our asses off. And our life was over. It was over. [audience laughing] All because I couldn’t eat pizza by myself. [audience laughing] And I can’t tell you what you should do with your life. I don’t know. Have kids, not have kids. Who knows? Get married, not get married. You know? But for me, it was worth it. For me, this whole thing was worth it, because now I know, at the end, there’ll be someone to pick up the phone. You know? At the end, there’ll be someone there to pick up the phone when the police call… [audience laughing] …and say they found me swimming in the fountain at the mall again. [audience laughing] “Come on down. No, he’s having a good time. No rush.” [audience laughing] “No, his pants are on this time. He’s actually having a good time.” [audience laughing] “Kids are throwing pennies at him. He doesn’t even feel it.” [audience laughing] “He might have stolen a PlayStation. We’ll talk about it when you get here.” [laughter and applause] [Tom laughs] [cheering and applause] [Tom laughs] [Tom laughs] We’re all going the same way, though. Whatever you choose, we’re all going off the same brochure. We’re all headed the same way. You know? If you’re young here tonight, and you see an old person, I know you don’t think that that’s you in the future. You look at an old person, that’s not you in the future. That’s like looking at a sequoia tree or a unicorn. [audience laughing] But it is going to be you one day, before you know it. If you’re older and look at a young person and think, “I still look like that,” you don’t. You don’t. [audience laughing] [applause] You don’t. I know it’s a cliché, but I’m turning into my father. It’s happening. I’m not planning it. I just bought a three-pack of silicone spray the other day. [audience laughing] I don’t even know what it is. [audience laughing] I don’t know what people use it for, but I knew it was a deal, so I bought it. [audience laughing] Just like my father would. And now I’m gonna give one away to the mailman for no reason. [audience laughing] Just like my father. We all think we’re young, and strong, and healthy, and you all look beautiful tonight. But before you know it, you’re gonna be in line at the airport, at the gate, you’re gonna be wearing a neck pillow, thinking it’s cool. And you’re gonna break into old people exercises, out of nowhere. Just gonna start doing some of these. [audience laughing] We’re gonna be those old people who start coughing, out of nowhere. Not eating anything, not drinking anything, and they just explode! [loud cough] [audience laughing] Turning purple. The eyes popping out. [groans loudly] And then they just stop and continue with the conversation. [audience laughing] “Are we gonna talk about what just happened?” “You literally almost died a second ago.” “No? All right. Continue with the story I’ve heard a thousand times.” “This is great.” [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] It’s hard to be an old person nowadays, though. It’s hard. Can’t even retire anymore. They keep raising the retirement age. That’s not cool. That’s not nice to the old people. That’s not nice to the young people who have to work with old people that long. Do you… [laughs] Do you really want an 80-year-old pilot? Really? [audience laughs] “Buckle up. We’re going to Dayton! I mean Denver. You know what I mean.” [audience laughing] [sighs] “I’m so tired.” [audience laughing] “I should have retired a while ago, but they won’t let me.” “I’m close to death, and so are you!” [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] If we’re gonna make old people work, let’s have fun with them. Rent ’em out. Rent them out to people who want to take the carpool lane. [audience laughing] Tell them they’re going to work. You get to the office, drop ’em off, someone takes them the other way. [audience laughing] “Are we almost there?” [laughs] “You were already there.” “I was?” [audience laughing] “Didn’t even eat my lunch.” [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] Rent them out to people who do those haunted hayrides. Just drop six old people in the woods along the path. [audience laughing] [Tom laughing] I don’t mean to mock old people. I really don’t. I want to be old people. I want you all to be old people. That would be a blessing, you know? It’ll be great. I’ll still be on tour. I’ll come to your nursing home. I’ll tell jokes. You won’t be able to laugh. You’ll just blink and fart at me. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] I want to live till I’m one of those guys that starts dressing like a sea captain for no reason. [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] You ever see these guys? They don’t have a boat, they don’t live near the ocean. They just show up like Captain Crunch one day. [audience laughing] “Toot, toot!” Got the hat, the buttons, the whole thing. And we just have to go along with it. [audience laughing] I hope you have a good rest of your year. I do. You know, enjoy yourself. I don’t think it’s gonna be a great year. Uh… [audience laughing] Seems like it’s gonna be pretty annoying. I’d say turn off the news once in a while, but it’s getting tougher to do. Everyone’s got dumb phones in your pocket. Every time you open them, “Ah!” Another jackass yelling at you, right? “I just want to find a coffee place.” “Oh! Ah!” [audience laughs] Terrifying, these phones. I had to describe to my nephew the other day what “nuclear Armageddon” was. Yeah. Thanks for that, TikTok. [audience laughing] The kid had no idea what it was. He’s 17 years old, by the way. Yeah. I was like, “Maybe there’s an advantage to being a C-student. Good for you.” [audience laughing] [Tom laughs] Everyone’s yelling at him to read more. He was happy until a week ago. [audience laughing] I was like, “Yeah, look. Yeah, look, we’re all gonna die one day, and there’s a way we could all die on the same day.” [audience laughing] So don’t worry about it. You can know too much in this world. You can know too much. You don’t need all this information. Just because it’s feeding us all the time, doesn’t mean you need it. You don’t need it all. You know? Sure, you can die in a nuclear attack. You could also die in a squirrel attack. I saw that on YouTube. It’s a horrible death. They gouge out your eyes and fill you with nuts. [audience laughing] You can know too much in this world, my friends. If someone gives you a chocolate chip cookie, you don’t think about what’s in that cookie. You don’t think about all the butter, and the fat, and the sugar, and salt. Made with someone’s hands. Someone’s hands! [audience laughing] They say it like it’s a good thing. “Here’s a handmade cookie.” [audience laughing] [laughter continues] [Tom chuckles] Don’t think about that. Someone gives you a cookie, “Thank you!” [munching] [audience laughing] Do you want to know all your friends’ political views? [chuckles] Not if you want friends, you don’t! [audience laughing] Don’t ask those questions. You can know too much. I’ll be honest with you. I don’t want to know what my wife is thinking about most things most of the time. [audience laughing] We’ve been happily married for 24 years. You know why? We don’t ask dumb questions. [audience laughs] [cheering and applause] “Are you happy right now?” “Is there anything I should change about myself?” We don’t ask those questions. You want to be happily married? Shut up and keep going. [audience roaring with laughter] [cheering and applause] [Tom laughs] Couples therapy? Are you high? [audience laughs] Pay a stranger to pick at your old fights? Hell no! I tell my wife every night, “Look, you’re a mess. I’m a mess.” “Let’s watch a show.” [audience laughing] I’ll be honest with you. She doesn’t like me right now. She hasn’t for, like, two months. I have no idea why. And I’m not gonna find out. [audience laughing] [applause] She’ll come back. She’ll come back. Twenty-four years. She’ll forget. She’ll come back. No, I love her to death. We’re so solid. If we didn’t get divorced from all the animals we live with, we’re gonna be fine. I said when we were getting married, “I’d love to start a family with you.” “That sounds wonderful. I don’t need pets.” She said, “I don’t need pets either.” And she lied right to my face. [audience laughing] My wife and daughters went out and got different animals every single week. I live in this weird Noah’s ark. You should see it. Birds and fish and lizards. We have a lizard. It has a life expectancy of 50 years. [audience laughing] And it knows it. It knows it. [audience laughing] Just hangs out on his branch and looks at me, like… [laughs mockingly] “We both know who’s winning this race.” [audience laughing] Two crazy dogs. We have this pug named Frank. The thing is hilarious. [cheering and applause] It’s like living with an alien. It snores while it eats. [audience laughs] Who does that? He’s standing at his bowl, he’s chewing and he’s swallowing. He’s awake. His eyes are closed. He’s snoring. He’s asleep. [audience laughing] On Thanksgiving, I went to move the cutting board, after I carved the turkey, and all the juice came running down the bridges of it, off the edge, right onto his face. I never saw a dog laugh before. [audience laughing] He was so happy for half of the day. Then the other half, he was miserable. He smelled turkey but didn’t know where it was coming from. [audience laughing] [snoring] [audience laughing] And we’ve got this giant black lab, who shits like a man. [audience laughing] Never seen anything like it. And I have to scoop it up and bring it back to the house, like I’m bringing in wood for the storm. [audience laughing] And a cat, a psychotic serial killer cat, who just kills for fun. Doesn’t eat any of it. Just rips it to pieces and drops it off. Here’s a bird with no head. “Oh!” [audience laughs] “Why would you do that?” He looks at me like, “Why would you ask me this question?” [audience laughing] “I give you a gift, and this is how you treat me?” [audience laughing] It brings in live rats and drops them in the laundry room. Live rats! He goes to the yard, gets rats, drags them in by their neck, like the rat owes us money. [audience laughing] Of course my wife and I aren’t gonna like each other all the time. We’re now a rat-catching team. This is how we spend our time. I’m good with the magazine. I can get it into the corner, you know? I can pin it. But then the three of us are looking at each other. My wife, the rat, and I. Someone’s got to make a move. Someone’s got to grab this rat by its ass and get it outside. And I’ll be honest with you. I’m not doing it. [audience laughing] I didn’t want these animals. I’m not grabbing a rat trying to bite me. I’m good at faking it. Like I’m really trying, you know? [audience laughing] “They’re so fast.” [audience laughing] [laughs] My wife does it. She gets impatient. She grabs it and looks at me. “You sissy.” And takes it outside. I’ll be honest with you. That’s why I don’t like her sometimes. [audience laughs] Who does that? Now I’ve got to compartmentalize that I’m not married to old “Rat Fingers” Johnson. [audience laughing] The love of my life is now covered in rat fingers. “Oh, you don’t want to fool around? Maybe I’ll make you a cookie.” [audience laughing] Thank you so much for coming. You guys were great. [cheering and applause] Thank you so much. Take care of yourselves. I’ll see you next time around.

              " 'anthony': [\"[crowd cheering] Thank you all for coming to the show tonight. I do appreciate it. In case you guys don’t know why I’m on tour right now, as of a couple of months ago, I’ve been doing stand-up comedy for 20 years. [audience cheers] Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My agent said to me, “Anthony, 20 years is a major accomplishment for any comedian.” “You gotta celebrate.” “Pick some of your favorite cities, go perform for them.” And I said, “No, thank you.” [audience chuckles] “I’d rather go to Milwaukee.” [audience laughs and applauds] But look… [audience chuckles] …I am excited to be here tonight. I’ve got great news. After 20 years of stand-up comedy, just last weekend, I finally perfected my act. [audience chuckles] Don’t get me wrong. I thought it was perfect before. [audience chuckles] Ran into an audience member after my show last Saturday who told me different. [audience chuckles] Last Saturday night, I’m doing a show in New York. After my set, I’m trying to get out to the car. A woman from the audience chases me down, practically tackles me. She says, “Anthony, that last joke you told tonight, your closer.” “I’ve gotta tell you, that joke is problematic.” “You need to think about it, and you need to change it.” So I changed it. And now it’s my opener. [audience laughs] [cheering and applauding] So, what I’m gonna do is I’m gonna tell you that joke. Explain what happened with that woman. And then nail home the point that I’m the best. [audience cheers and applauds] Now, as a comedian, I’ve got a responsibility. A responsibility that I take very seriously. The responsibility to get up in front of a group of strangers and give you my opinion on the trans community. [audience chuckles] Yeah. That’s right. [scattered cheering and applause] Look, guys. You’ve got to do it now. It’s in the handbook. Now, I feel… I feel like the trans community are the new pregnant women. [audience chuckles] Just in that… [clicks tongue] …it is never polite to guess. [audience laughs] Guys, you’ve got to trust me on this. You never… you never want to be like, “Hey.” “How far along are you?” [audience laughs] “Are you going to keep it or…?” No. [audience laughs] No, don’t do that. Even if you’re right, it’s rude. [audience chuckles] Do what I do. I’m smooth with it. I don’t ask the question. If I want to find something out, I just offer you a drink. “Here, have this glass of bourbon.” And if they say, “Actually, Anthony, I’m seven months pregnant,” then I get to be like, “Oh my God, you look amazing.” [audience laughs] But if they take the drink, they’re trans. [audience laughs] [scattered cheers] Now, obviously… obviously, that’s a closer. [audience chuckles] I could leave right now. It’d be fine. [audience chuckles] But this woman grabs me. Starts arguing with me. She says, “Anthony, I’ve gotta ask you, what is your intention with that trans joke?” I said, “Well, my intention is to make trans people laugh.” I mean, could you imagine? That would be historic. [audience laughs] And she says, “Well, Anthony…” “Anthony, you’re probably not even aware of this, but the problem with your joke is some trans people are insecure about the fact that they can’t have kids of their own.” “And your joke makes it sound like you’re saying the opposite of a pregnant woman is a trans woman, and that could be hurtful.” And I agree. [audience chuckles] That could be hurtful. But not coming from me. [clicks tongue] You see, I love trans people. I empathize with the trans community. I’m not trans myself. But I, too, am always getting yelled at for walking into the wrong bathroom. [audience laughs] I love trans people. You know what I hate? Pregnant women. [audience laughs and applauds] I mean, fuck those chubby bitches, am I right? They shouldn’t be allowed to play sports. [audience laughs] Now, look. Look, I will admit… I will admit that was a learning moment for me. Before that woman grabbed me, I didn’t know that trans people hated pregnant women as much as I do. [audience laughs] Makes me respect them all the more. So, just in case anyone here tonight is trans and you were offended by my first joke, here’s a joke I tailor wrote just for you to enjoy. Last week I saw a pregnant woman get hit by a bus. [audience chuckles] Or as I like to call it, a gender reveal party. [audience groans and laughs] [cheering and applause] What are you guys laughin’ at? That’s not for you. That’s just for my trans friends. Don’t like pregnant women. Don’t like kids. One of my friends just asked me if I would be the sperm donor for her baby. I said, “I don’t know. That’s a pretty big decision.” “How old is your baby?” [audience laughs] [cheers and applause] If you’re walkin’ in late, I hate kids. [audience chuckles] I hate them so much. It’s my whole thing. And what surprises me is now that I’m getting older, I’ve got friends, family members having kids of their own. And I don’t judge. Throw your life away. [audience chuckles] What surprises me is these people will text me pictures of their kids. “Anthony will want to see this. Send.” I never want to see that. [audience chuckles] The only time a kid shows up on my phone and I’m happy about it, Amber alert. Otherwise… [audience laughs] Otherwise, do not get my hopes up. [audience chuckles] I used to ignore those texts from my friends. Pretend I didn’t see ’em. Never respond. Then my sister had a kid. Started getting mad at me. She’d be like, “Really, Anthony? No response?” “You got nothing to say about this picture of your beautiful niece fucking up finger painting?” [audience chuckles] So I came up with a plan. Now, anytime, anytime anyone texts me a picture of their kids, I write back the exact same response. “Thanks.” [audience chuckles] “Gonna save this one for later.” [audience groans and laughs] Yup. No, that works. You guys can use that. It works. I haven’t heard from my sister in a year. It’s the best. Mm-hmm. Like a lot of people, I spent most of the pandemic stuck inside, starin’ at the walls, goin’ crazy. I started buyin’ weird shit online. Decided I was gonna redecorate my place. I don’t know anything about interior design. But I know what I like. So I went on eBay, and I paid $500 for a child’s coffin. [audience chuckles] I thought, “This’ll be great. It’s vintage.” [audience chuckles] You put that in your living room, it’s a conversation starter. You know? [audience laughs] But like so many of the things we bought online during the pandemic, I regret it now. Thing finally showed up in the mail. Empty. [audience chuckles] I know. I know. Look. Guys, guys, guys. I hate kids so goddamn much. [audience chuckles] I can’t talk to kids these days. The other day, my little nephew came up to me. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I’ve been getting bullied by another kid in school.” I said, “Don’t put up with that.” “Break his nose.” “He’ll leave you alone.” He said, “Uncle Anthony, that’s toxic masculinity.” [audience chuckles] Well, I wasn’t gonna put up with that. [audience laughs] Listen, you guys came out here to have a good time on a Saturday night. I know what you want. You want to talk politics. Let’s go. [audience chuckles] Let me tell you what’s wrong with this country. Let me tell you what the problem is with the United States of America. In this country, you’ve gotta be 16 years old to drive a car, right? That makes sense. But you’ve gotta be 18 years old to be considered an adult. To vote. I think that’s fucked up. I think if you’re old enough and mature enough to safely drive a car on the street, then I should be allowed to have sex with you. Right? [audience groans and laughs] Anyway… [audience chuckles] That’s the only problem with this country. [audience cheers] Now, as of this weekend, I’ve been on tour with this material for 18 months. And my favorite thing about touring around the country with these jokes the past 18 months has been telling that last joke in the South. [audience laughs] Guys, I have learned so much about this great country of ours. Right at the beginning of this tour, 18 months ago, I was doing a show in Alabama. Told them that joke. Guy in the audience stands up and says, “Anthony, I hate to break it to you, but the age of consent in Alabama is 16, so you gotta change that.” [audience chuckles] I said, “Oh, yeah?” You got to change that. And then a couple of weeks later, I did a show in Mississippi. Told them that joke then told them about Alabama. [audience chuckles] Guy in the audience stands up and says, “In Mississippi, the age of consent is 14.” And I said, “Ho-ly shit.” [audience laughs] That’s perfect. [audience laughs] I mean… That is what the Founding Fathers were all about. You know? I have a friend who works for the FBI. He pretends to be a 12-year-old girl. Goes on the Internet and chats with child molesters all day. I don’t know what he does for the FBI, but it’s gotta be… [audience laughs and applauds] I feel like the big new thing I keep hearing more and more about these days is porn addiction. I feel like every time I turn around, someone is complaining about their porn addiction. Not me. [audience chuckles] I can handle my shit. [audience laughs] But a couple of months ago, I’m at a family reunion. Big Jeselnik family reunion. Everyone is there. And the very first night, we’re all in this giant ballroom, eating dinner together as a family when my cousin stands up. He’s 15 years old. He says, “I have an announcement to make.” “I just want to tell you all that I’ve been suffering from a porn addiction.” “And it’s terrible.” “But I’m doing my best to get over it.” No one in my family knows what to say. Generations of Jeselniks are just staring straight ahead. Trying to eat their dinner. So I stood up. [audience chuckles] I said, “Hey, man.” “We can watch something else.” [audience laughs] “Look, I can put the game on if you want.” But when’s the next time we’re all gonna be together, you know? [clicks tongue] I don’t have a porn addiction. I watch a healthy amount of porn. [audience chuckles] I’ve got my favorites. Hell, I was in a bar the other night, saw my favorite porn star of all time sitting at the end of the bar by herself. I couldn’t believe it. I called the bartender over, “Man, I’ll have another beer.” “And see that girl down there?” “She shouldn’t be here. She’s 13.” [audience groans and laughs] Now, this is where audiences traditionally start to complain. [audience chuckles] They’ll say, “Anthony, why do you have so many jokes about abusing children?” “And why do you do them all in the beginning?” And this is where I kind of have to stop the show for a minute. And I explain to the audience the concept of gallows humor. Gallows humor is what I’m all about. Gallows humor is when you see something in the world that is so horrible that you have to laugh at it. Otherwise, it would destroy you. A couple of months ago, I’m reading the newspaper, and I come across an article about a priest in my hometown who just got arrested for molesting an altar boy at the exact same church where I was an altar boy growing up. That was horrifying to read. That could’ve been me. If I had become a priest. [audience laughs] [scattered applause] We like to have fun. [audience chuckles] I’m proud to say that I’ve never once in my entire life paid money to have sex with a prostitute. And I’ll tell you this. They get so mad. [audience laughs] You know, there’s one thing I like about Milwaukee. [clicks tongue] And there is one thing I like about Milwaukee. [audience chuckles] Seems like a safe place to live. Yeah. Maybe not to you, but compared to where I live in Los Angeles, oh my God, this is paradise. My neighborhood’s really gone to shit in the past couple years. Gotten dangerous. The other day, a woman in my neighborhood was walking her dog, had the dog stolen from her at gunpoint. Now it’s my dog. [audience laughs] I actually do love it here in Milwaukee. I enjoy any time I get to come and perform. One of the all-time great stand-up comedy towns, Milwaukee. Yeah. It cheers me up to be back in Milwaukee. I’ll tell you that. I’ve needed cheering up lately too. I’ve been a little down lately. I’ll admit it. Lost a friend recently. Stupid. Friend of mine went to the hospital for an elective surgery. A simple breast reduction surgery. Did not survive the surgery. Died right there on the operating table. As far as I’m concerned. [audience laughs] [audience cheers and applauds] Yeah. Somehow that’s become one of the most polarizing jokes I’m gonna tell all night. And if you didn’t laugh at it, that’s okay. But what the fuck do you know? [audience chuckles] I’ve been doing this for 20 years. [woman cheers] And I’ll be honest, I had no idea it had been 20 years before my agent told me. I never thought of 20 years as a goal I should be trying to achieve. I’ve never defined success by longevity. I’ve always defined success by how long has it been since I had to have a roommate. [audience chuckles] Yeah. It’s true. I haven’t had a roommate in 15 years. [woman cheers] I’m 45. That’s not a flex. [audience laughs] Last roommate I ever had… Last roommate I ever had, he had a video of every single person he’d ever had sex with in our apartment. Yeah. It’s a betrayal of trust. But it was hilarious. He had no idea. [audience laughs] Another way I define success as an artist. How long has it been since I had to have a day job? Again, 15 years. I hated the day jobs I had to have coming up. Imagine what I was like at a day job 15 years ago. [audience chuckles] I had this one day job. Someone kept stealing my lunch. Someone stole my lunch every single day, even though I clearly had my name written on it. And I was pretty sure I knew who did it. I just couldn’t prove it. So, one day before work, I crushed up an entire bottle of laxatives. Enough laxatives to cripple a man. And I put them in my food, and then I waited until this guy got up to go to the bathroom. And as soon as he did, I shit all over his desk. [audience laughs] [clicks tongue] Yeah, I got fired from most of my day jobs. All of them, really. All of them except the last one. Last day job I ever had, I worked in a giant, soulless corporate office building, and I quit in the middle of the day after I watched a 60-year-old woman accidentally step into an empty elevator shaft and plummet 30 stories to her death. I just walked right the fuck out. And that was my last day in elevator repair. [audience laughs] If there’s one thing I’m getting sick of after 20 years of stand-up comedy, it’s the travel. I always say I do the shows for free. You pay me to travel. And that is certainly true tonight. [audience chuckles] Two nights ago, I fly from New York City to Milwaukee. Two-and-a-half-hour flight. It’s direct. It should be easy. I get on the plane. The woman sitting next to me has a 100-pound dog curled up in her lap. And I say, “Excuse me, but what the fuck is this?” [audience laughs] This woman, I swear to God, she rolls her eyes at me, and she goes, “Uh, this is my emotional support animal.” “I have a note from my doctor.” I was like, “Note from your doctor?” “Do you really need an emotional support animal on this flight?” And she goes, “No.” And I thought my head was going to explode. I don’t like when people take advantage of the system like that. It’s a two-and-a-half-hour flight. I talked to her about it. I’m happy to report by the time we landed, she needed that fucking dog. [audience laughs] Air travel has gotten so uncomfortable in the past few years. But everyone I know who flies a lot like I do, they always have a little trick. Everyone’s got their own unique trick to make flying easier for them. Like, I’m friends with a very wealthy married couple. They’re millionaires. And they got six kids in between the two of ’em. They’re always flying off on some exotic family vacation. And whenever they fly, their trick is the family flies on two separate airplanes. That way, worst-case scenario, one of those planes crashes, they don’t have to deal with their kids anymore. [audience laughs] Uh-huh. But look, if I’m being honest with you guys… If I’m being honest, I don’t actually have any married friends. [audience chuckles] I used to. Used to have a lot of married friends. But all my married friends have gotten divorced in the past two years. All of them. But I’ve noticed something. All my friends’ divorces, they all had two things in common. Infidelity and me. [audience laughs] Hey, listen. [clicks tongue] All right, listen. You guys have been great so far. I hate to do this to you, but this next joke is gonna be too smart for the crowd. Don’t worry. I will explain it to you. And after all, aren’t those the best jokes? Sigmund Freud’s mom must’ve been so fucking hot. [audience laughs] Okay? Get that? A lot of you were faking it for the cameras. Let me explain. Dr. Sigmund Freud. The most famous psychoanalyst of all time. His main theory, his main claim to fame, was the theory that every young man wanted to murder his own father and have sex with his own mother. Imagine. Imagine how hot his mom must have been for his colleagues to go, “Publish that.” [audience laughs] [clicks tongue] I was 14 years old when I walked in on my parents having sex. That’s a big moment for any young man. That moment when you realize your parents are more than just Mom and Dad. They’re also swingers. [audience laughs] Yeah, that was a core memory, for sure. Never forget that. I’ll never forget the night of my senior prom. Night of my senior prom. I’m 18 years old. I’m at home, putting on my tuxedo when my dad walked in the room, and he handed me a condom. Snuck it to me in a handshake. So fuckin’ gross. [audience chuckles] Then he looks me right in the eyes, and he says, “Anthony, do you have any questions?” I said, “Yeah, Dad.” Do you have one that’s still in the wrapper? [audience laughs] Yeah, my dad was fuckin’ weird, okay? All your dads are weird. When you’re a kid, you can’t recognize how weird your parents are. It’s not until you get older that you figure it out. Like, when I was a little kid, every year on my birthday, my dad would take me into the kitchen, put me up against the kitchen wall and make a little mark to measure my girth. [audience laughs] [Anthony] Mm. And maybe that messed me up a little bit. I don’t know. I feel like I’m a pretty normal guy. Although I do get angry when people try to talk to me about sex. I was having lunch with a friend the other day. And he says, “Anthony, I’ve been havin’ trouble with premature ejaculation.” I said, “Oh, yeah?” “Why don’t you try talkin’ about baseball?” [audience chuckles] He said, “Anthony, don’t you mean thinking about baseball?” And I said, “I don’t give a fuck what you think about.” “Just don’t talk to me about your premature ejaculation.” [audience cheers] When I was growin’ up, I had a sibling rivalry with my little brother. Got out of hand, to be quite honest. One day, my little brother went into the backyard, took my dog’s collar off, and let it run away from home. So I poisoned his fish. [audience chuckles] I think I won that one. ‘Cause the next day, I went out, and I found my dog, put his collar back on, brought him back home. But my brother, he died from the salmon. [audience laughs] Yeah, it’s a banger. [audience chuckles] Last year, my parents lost all of their money in a Ponzi scheme. So, of course, they came to me. Their wealthy, successful son. And asked me why I did that. [audience laughs] [Anthony] Mm. Mm. Yeah. My family didn’t have a lot of money when I was growin’ up. My dad was a volunteer firefighter. Do you know what a volunteer firefighter is? It is exactly like a regular firefighter. Except your son does not respect you. [audience chuckles] My mom’s been having a hard time. She’s gettin’ paranoid in her old age. Can’t sleep at night ’cause she gets too scared. So every night, around bedtime, she calls me to complain on the phone for hours that she’s too afraid to fall asleep in her own home. So finally, after months of this, just to get her off my back, I bought her a gun. And now she’s scared about that. She said, “Anthony, what’s the matter with you?” “Don’t you know that people who live with a gun are more than twice as likely to be shot in their own home?” I said, “Mom, I am counting on it.” [audience laughs and groans] And look, maybe, maybe I’m being too harsh. I have trouble sleeping sometimes too. Like the other night. The other night, I’m lying in bed, and I cannot fall asleep. I’m just staring out my bedroom window for hours. And I swear, I saw my next-door neighbor murder his wife in their kitchen then dispose of the body in garbage bags. Now I’m worried I’m next. Like, I don’t think he saw me, but he sure as shit heard me clappin’. [audience laughs] Now, here’s a joke I like a lot. My cousin Randy is maybe the dumbest person I’ve ever met in my entire life. Dumbest guy I’ve ever met. The other day, he comes up, and he goes, “Anthony, check out my new tattoo.” “It’s the Japanese symbol for awesome.” [clicks tongue] “No, Randy.” “That’s a swastika.” [audience laughs] “I mean, fuck, man. Everybody knows.” “Everybody knows that’s the German symbol for awesome.” [audience laughs and cheers] Now, I said I liked that joke a lot. Here’s how much I like that joke. I used to open with it. Right at the beginning of this tour, 18 months ago, Kanye West came to one of my shows. I had no idea he was even there. I didn’t find out until the next day when Kanye went on a podcast. And he said, “I went to go see Anthony Jeselnik last night, and his opening joke is so high level that it made me realize I’m not funny.” [audience chuckles] Guys, that blew my mind That’s the best compliment I’ve ever gotten in my life. I humbled Kanye West. [audience chuckles] You know. Yeah. I’m not gonna lie. I was so excited. I watched that clip 100 times. I sent it to my manager. I said, “Put this on my website.” “Put it on social media.” “Let’s sell some fucking tickets… [audience chuckles] …with a little help from Kanye.” And my manager says to me, “Anthony, are you out of your goddamn mind?” “Don’t you know what’s been going on with Kanye lately?” And I said no. Honestly. I used to be a huge Kanye fan, but I stopped paying attention to him when he went Christian. [audience chuckles] And my manager says, “Well, in the past two weeks alone, Kanye’s been wearing White Lives Matter T-shirts and saying wild, anti-Semitic shit.” And I was like, “Oh.” [clicks tongue] “He went super Christian.” [audience laughs] [audience cheers and applauds] That crazy son of a bitch finally finished the whole book. [audience laughs] My manager said, “Look, Anthony, you can use this clip of Kanye to promote yourself if you want to, but if you do, you gotta drop that swastika joke.” “You gotta stop doing it for sure.” “Otherwise, you’re gonna start to attract the wrong kinds of fans, and your current fans will take the wrong lesson from what you’re doing.” And that’s how much I like that joke. [audience laughs] I’m against cancel culture. [audience cheers] Thank you. That’s my impression of a shit comic trying to get on Rogan. [audience cheers] In 20 years of stand-up comedy, I’ve been asked the same questions over and over and over again. The question I get asked the most by far is, “Anthony, what do you think about cancel culture?” “Does it make you mad?” “Aren’t you scared? What do you think about cancel culture?” So, let me be clear. I don’t give a fuck about cancel culture. What I am sick of are comedians complaining about cancel culture. It’s not that hard. Do your job. [audience laughs and cheers] Comedians are supposed to be unparalleled badasses. I know this because I have a fucking mirror. [audience laughs] Cancel culture is not scary. It’s also not interesting. And it’s definitely not new. Back when I was in college, I had this crazy professor. Made all of his students fill out their own suicide note. Then he would read them out loud to the rest of the class. [audience chuckles] As soon as the parents found out, he got fired immediately. And I was the only one who stood up for him. Because, hey, he made math fun. [audience laughs] And yes, I did mention Joe Rogan, guys. Do not get me wrong. I like Joe. Joe’s my friend. Joe’s a good guy. But if you listen to his podcast, you’re a fucking loser. [audience laughs] My brother-in-law is Joe Rogan’s biggest fan. Never misses an episode. Doesn’t think four hours is long enough. But my brother-in-law is Joe Rogan’s target demographic. My brother-in-law is a conspiracy theorist. A crazy conspiracy theorist. Like, my brother-in-law refuses to become an organ donor because he swears that if you get into an accident and the paramedics see that you’re an organ donor, they won’t try to save your life ’cause they want to use your organs to help someone else. It’s insane, but I can’t argue with him. He’s a paramedic. [audience laughs] Another question I’ve been asked a million times in the last 20 years, “Anthony, what’s your favorite joke you’ve ever written?” It’s easy. The first one. Twenty years ago, when I started this, I started from nothing. I was nothing. I was just going around to open mics in Los Angeles, performing for bitter open-mic comedians who never reacted to anything. I was just trying to find my voice. Could I be good at this? Could I make it a living? And it took a while. Until one night, I went to a coffee shop, tried this joke out for the first time. Changed my whole life. I said, “Guys, my girlfriend loves to eat chocolate.” “She’s always eating chocolate, and she likes to joke she’s got a chocolate addiction.” Hmm? “‘Keep me away from those chocolate bars. I’m addicted to ’em.'” “And it’s really annoying.” “So one day I put her in the car, and I drove her downtown, and I pointed out a crack addict, and I said, ‘Do you see that, honey?'” “‘Why can’t you be that skinny?'” [audience laughs] And I will never forget telling that joke for the very first time to a room full of bitter open-mic comedians who never reacted to anything. And the whole room just went, “Ooh.” [audience chuckles] I was like, “Oh, I’m gonna be a fucking star.” [audience laughs] And then, of course, a couple years later, I got my big break, and I got to do some roasting. Got to roast Donald Trump, Charlie Sheen, Roseanne Barr, all the greats. [audience cheers] People still ask me, “Anthony, which one was your favorite?” Charlie Sheen. But not because of Charlie Sheen. I didn’t give a fuck about Charlie Sheen. I remember a couple days before that roast, I’m at home writing jokes. And I get a phone call from the network. And they say, “Anthony, I know you only have a couple days left to write, but we just added Mike Tyson to the dais.” “Will you be able to write yourself any jokes about Mike Tyson?” [audience chuckles] Two days later, I am walking into that roast with 100 jokes about Mike Tyson. [audience laughs] I am so excited. And right as I go to sit down, guy from the network comes back. He goes, “I’m just double-checking with you.” “You don’t have any Mike Tyson rape jokes, do you?” [audience chuckles] And I said, “Why?” [audience laughs] And he said, “Well, it was almost impossible to get Mike Tyson to agree to appear on a televised roast.” “We had to promise him there would be no rape jokes.” I was like, “Are we talking about the same Mike Tyson?” [audience laughs] So now the roast has begun. I’m up at the podium. Cameras are rolling. I have zero jokes about Mike Tyson. [audience laughs] And I am mad about it. But out of the corner of my eye, I can see Mike Tyson sitting on the stage. Mike’s been drinkin’. Mike’s been smokin’. Mike’s laughing at everything. Mike’s responding to jokes that aren’t even about him. Mike Tyson was having the time of his life. So I think, “You know what?” “I can do one.” [audience laughs] So I said, “I think Mike Tyson’s biggest problem is Mike never had a strong male role model growing up.” “Mike’s dad walked out on the family very early on after Mike raped him.” [audience laughs] [scattered applause] Now, as soon as I tell this joke… As soon as I tell this joke, I regret it. [audience chuckles] I am afraid. And I turned to look at Mike Tyson to see, is he coming at me? Am I about to die? And I just see Mike Tyson throw his head back, and he goes, [laughs] “He got you, Charlie.” [audience laughs] Guys, in 20 years of stand-up comedy, I’ve gotten to meet so many famous people. Haven’t given a fuck about any of ’em. Except for one, and that was Norm Macdonald. [audience cheers] Yeah. Yeah. All right. Long before I ever even considered becoming a comedian, I worshiped Norm Macdonald. He was my hero when I was a kid. He’s still my hero today. Never got to meet him for the longest time. Then a couple years ago, I get a phone call from my agent. He says, “Anthony, how would you like to be the new host of Last Comic Standing?” And I said, “Why the fuck would I want to do that?” [audience laughs] “That show sucks.” And he said, “This year, it’s gonna be different.” “This year, they have Norm Macdonald as a judge.” “Would you like to work with Norm?” And I signed up on the spot. Norm and I made eight episodes of this TV show together. Eight straight nights of eight-hour tapings every night. And for the first four episodes, Norm Macdonald and I do not get along at all. [audience chuckles] We get into fights every night on the air. We get into fights every night backstage. We flat-out do not like each other. And it’s killing me. He’s my hero and the only reason I took this job. So for those first four episodes, I am working at it, and I’m working at it hard. Norm’s working at it too, just not nearly as hard. [audience chuckles] But after four episodes, for whatever reason, something clicks. Finally, Norm and I are laughing together. We’re getting along. All I ever wanted. After the show was finally finished, Norm and I had to go and promote it. And the last time I ever saw Norm Macdonald, we are backstage at Larry King. I’m getting interviewed first, and then Norm. Right before I go out, Norm says to me, “Hey, Anthony, I know we haven’t always gotten along or seen eye-to-eye, but if you’re up for it and you trust me, I thought of something really funny that you and I could do together.” I said, “Oh my God, Norm. Of course. You’re my hero.” “Tell me what you want to do.” He says, “I think it’ll be funny if instead of promoting the show by talking about these other comedians, why don’t you and I just promote the show by publicly insulting each other?” He says, “Don’t even try to be funny, Anthony.” “Just be mean.” [audience chuckles] And I said, “You know what, Norm? I can do that.” [audience laughs] I sit down with Larry King. Larry says, “Anthony, what you think about Norm Macdonald?” And I said, “Larry, Norm Macdonald is a piece of shit.” [audience chuckles] And I can hear Norm laughing backstage. I finish the interview. I go backstage. Norm is still laughin’. He says, “Anthony, that was perfect.” “Now, watch this.” [audience chuckles] Norm sits down with Larry King. Larry King says, “Norm, what do you think about Anthony Jeselnik?” Norm says, “Larry, he’s one of the greats.” [audience laughs] [audience applauds and cheers] I’ve never been more pissed off in my entire life. [audience chuckles] Can’t believe I fell for that. You have been an amazing crowd today. I’m going to leave you all with this. This is my new closer. Don’t worry. It is trans-proof. [audience chuckles] About a month ago, I went to a wedding. Craziest wedding I’ve ever seen. After the ceremony, every single person there took Molly. The bride took Molly. The groom took Molly. The parents, the grandparents. Every single person there was on Molly. Craziest shit I’ve ever seen. I blacked out around midnight. Woke up the next morning in a fucking hammock somewhere. Went and found the bride and groom, and I was like, “Hey, guys.” “Did I do anything embarrassing last night?” And they said, “Yeah, Anthony.” “You spiked the punch with Molly.” [audience laughs] Thank you very much, Milwaukee. Have a great night. Thank you. [audience cheering and applauding] [indistinct, excited chatter] [chatter fades]\"],\n",
              " 'ellen': ['Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval is less a comedy special and more an hour-long ego massage for the embattled host. What should have been a triumphant farewell instead feels like a poorly executed PR stunt, filled with tired, drawn-out jokes and forced self-deprecation. Ellen spends much of the special rehashing controversies surrounding her toxic workplace allegations, but instead of addressing them meaningfully, she spins these moments into awkward jokes, coming across as defensive rather than introspective. The comedy itself is uninspired and stale, with tired observations about things like car troubles, pigeons, and aging that feel recycled from better comics. The pacing is atrocious, dragging on for what feels like an eternity, with Ellen stretching out weak material well beyond its comedic lifespan. Her attempts to balance humor with personal reflection fall flat, making it seem more like she’s fishing for sympathy rather than offering genuine entertainment. What’s most striking is the clear disconnect between Ellen and her audience. The packed crowd of adoring fans seems willing to laugh at anything she says, but the comedy is hollow, with Ellen relying on her celebrity status rather than delivering anything truly funny or meaningful. It’s painfully obvious that this special exists not because she has anything new to say, but because she needs to reclaim some positive attention after her tarnished reputation. For Your Approval is a disappointing, self-serving finale that highlights how out of touch Ellen has become. For anyone hoping for a strong farewell from a comedy icon, this special is a huge letdown. If this is Ellen’s swan song, it’s a sour note to go out on. * * * [gentle music playing] [presenter] If you have never seen Ellen do stand-up live, you are in for a treat tonight. [crowd cheering] Two minutes. [whoosh] [Johnny Carson] …her first appearance on network television. Would you welcome Ellen DeGeneres. Wouldn’t it be great if we could pick up the phone and call up God and ask, “Yeah, hi, God. This is Ellen.” [chuckles] “Ellen.” “DeGeneres.” “DeGeneres.” [chuckles] “W-What’s so funny?” [chuckles] “I never thought of that. It does sound like that, doesn’t it?” [audience laughs] My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was 60. She’s 97 today. We don’t know where the hell she is. [laughter] [reporter 1] Ellen is on the fast track. She’s one of the top female comedians on television. [reporter 2] Ellen’s new sitcom is a certifiable top-ten hit. [reporter 3] The real Ellen is putting all that success and fame at risk. Susan… I’m gay. [reporter 4] More than 36 million people watched her coming-out episode. Why did you think it was necessary for you to come out? Because it’s okay. [echoing] [Barbara Walters] Ellen finds herself at the center of a storm of controversy. [Diane Sawyer] Being accused of going too far, too gay. [Ellen as Dory] When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do? ♪ Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming ♪ [reporter 5] She may have pulled off one of the greatest comebacks of all time. [reporter 6] The Ellen Show has become one of the most popular shows in the world, praised for delivering a daily dose of joy with its unique mix of dancing, games, talk, and millions of dollars in audience giveaways. [reporter 7] Spreading laughter seems to be working well for the entertainer and comedian, and she’s showing no signs of slowing down. A few years ago, I started ending my show by saying, “Be kind to one another.” Here’s the downside, um, I can never do anything unkind ever now, ever. [reporter 8] Breaking news tonight. Is the queen of nice – really the queen of mean? [sighs] [reporter 9] Respond to this with the most insane stories about Ellen being mean. [woman] She’s not the happy-go-lucky nice person… [reporter 10] Ellen DeGeneres is under fire again with accusations of a toxic work environment. [woman 1] Toxic. Phony. Hypocrite. Liar. [woman 2] Things are spiraling. [voices overlapping] Ellen DeGeneres… DeGeneres… DeGeneres… [echoing builds] [voices end abruptly] [reporter] It’s a breaking story in the world of entertainment, and this is great, great news. Ellen is back. Although, she’s saying this new special will be her farewell. [audience cheering] [upbeat music playing] [audience cheering excitedly] Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you so much. It seems like you still care. [audience cheering] You know, I used to say that I didn’t care what other people thought of me. I realize now, looking back, I said that at the height of my popularity. [audience laughs] If I look older than when you saw me last, it’s because I’m older than when you saw me last. [audience laughs] And also, I stopped doing Botox and filler. [audience laughing and cheering] Yeah. I used to do Botox back when I didn’t care what other people thought of me. [audience laughs] [chuckles softly] That’s when I did it. Such a waste of time to worry about what people think of us. Just a waste of energy. We’re just guessing. We don’t know. It’s impossible to know what people are thinking. I walk out here tonight and I’m hoping that you’re thinking, “This is marvelous. I’m so happy to be here.” That is my hope, but… [audience cheering] Well… Good. [audience laughs] But some of you could be thinking, “Let’s see how this goes.” [audience laughs] Some of you may be thinking, “Why is she doing this? Does she owe back taxes?” [audience laughs] I’m here because I love doing stand-up. I miss doing stand-up, and I like making people happy, and I do care what people think. [audience cheering] We all care what people think. We can say we don’t. We can pretend we don’t care. All it takes is trying to parallel park in front of a crowded outdoor café. [audience laughs] Spot looks big enough. [audience laughs] You line it up the way you always do. You pull in, cut it a little too close. You’re scraping the hubcap the entire way along the curb. Making a very loud noise. Put it in drive, pull out. Try it again. Now you’ve overcompensated. You’re sticking so far out, you’re blocking traffic in that lane. Now you have a decision to make. Do you have the confidence to pull out and do it right this time? Or do you do that back-and-forth, back-and-forth, back-and-forth… inching your way to the curb? Knowing how long that’s gonna take, and people are watching. [audience laughs] The deep shame you feel when you give up and drive away. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] Even if you’re meeting someone, you say, “I’m so sorry. I couldn’t make it.” [audience laughs] And they’re like, “You did. I was sitting there, I was watching you.” [audience laughs] “I started the chant.” [audience laughs] [Ellen giggles] It’s funny how we can be embarrassed all by ourselves in a car. All by ourselves, for anything, just any stupid reason. Like, even if we just can’t figure out how to turn our windshield wipers off. Which, to me, is one of the most embarrassing things, is driving a car when it’s not raining and the windshield wipers are going. And it’s because someone decided to add a random one. We had… The windshield wiper situation was fine. We had the fast mode for when it’s raining heavily, medium, light. And then someone decided we’re just gonna wash away the rain once in a while. [audience laughs] We don’t need to see all the time. And it’s always a surprise ’cause you think the rain has stopped, you’ve turned it off and you’re driving along, and five minutes later, you see this thing, like… Then you’re trying to fiddle with it, trying to turn it off, and you don’t know how ’cause it’s always different. Sometimes it’s on the end of the lever on the steering wheel. Sometimes there’s a lever within the lever, the baby lever. Like the lever had a baby and it’s inside the lever right there. Tiny baby lever. You don’t trust it ’cause you’re just waiting… Even if it’s not going, you’re like, “It’s gonna go again. I know it. I feel it.” And then finally, it does, and then you feel pretty confident about it. Then you catch the rearview mirror, your back one’s been on the whole time. [audience laughs] Yeah. [audience cheering] That’s what you did. You turned that one on. You turn that off, turn everything back on again. You have to sell your car. [audience laughs] There’s so many extraneous things in a car we don’t need. For instance, I have never used my parking brake. I’ve never parked my car and thought, “I want it more parked than this.” [audience laughs] [audience cheering] There are things you need, the seat adjustments. Scoot forward. Lean back. You need those. Then there’s that one button that inflates the back of the seat, the one that makes you feel like you’re getting spooned by a pregnant woman. [audience laughs] “Oh boy.” “Ooh!” “All right.” Apparently, it’s for lumbar support. Got to support your lumbar. You got to. It’s all any of us knows about the lumbar. It’s got to be supported. [audience laughs] You don’t get support for your lumbar any place other than your car. [audience laughs] You don’t even hear about the lumbar anyplace else. [audience laughs] “Bill, what’s wrong? What’s happening?” “It’s my damn lumbar.” [audience laughs] “I haven’t been driving enough lately.” [audience laughs] Mm. [chuckling] That’s how you walk when your lumbar is out. There are buttons in my car I’ve never used, never will use. There’s a button with squiggly lines next to a misshapen peanut. I don’t know. [audience laughs] I’ve never touched it. I’m fine. There’s a button with tally marks next to a sideways yarmulke. What the hell? [audience laughs] Don’t get me started on the dashboard lights too. The dashboard lights are not illuminated all the time. So when they are, it must mean something serious, right? But “check engine”? That’s vague. [audience laughs] I’ve checked it. It’s there. [audience laughs] I shouldn’t have to guess from an exclamation point between two parentheses that my tire pressure is low. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] But if my windshield wiper fluid is low, all the words, “windshield wiper fluid low.” “Oh, my God. Pull over!” [audience laughs] Just ’cause I don’t know my buttons, doesn’t mean I’m stupid. Just means I’m not interested. We’re all interested in different things, all good at different things. I was talking to someone and they said, “I don’t know how you get on stage. I could never do that.” I said, “Well, I don’t know how you dry-clean clothes.” [audience laughs] Clean clothes dryly. And then you Martinize on top of that. Some of you are in your twenties. You don’t know what Martinizing is. [audience laughs] No. [audience cheering] It’s not my job to explain it to you. Also, I don’t know and I never have. [audience laughs] Yeah. None of us do. Let me catch you up on what’s been going on with me since you saw me last. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] I got chickens. [audience laughs] Yeah. [cheering] Thank you. I love them so very much. Chickens are the best bird to have at home, I think so. A lot of people think parrots, but they’re so gossipy. [audience laughs] You have to be really careful what you say around them. Chickens will never talk. They have little personalities. I’ve always wanted chickens. Now I have them, they’re so cute. They see me. They recognize me when I walk towards them, and they run to me. I put a swing in there for them, and they get on a swing. Chicken on a swing. That’s ridiculous. [audience laughs] I have a bench in there and I go sit there, and they sit on my lap, and I pet them and they fall asleep, and they give me an egg every day. They lay an egg every day. As someone who hosted a daily talk show, I can really appreciate that. [audience laughs] Yeah. Yeah. [audience cheering] I’m sure they’re thinking, “I just laid an egg.” I don’t think I can do that again tomorrow.” And yet, they do. They’re curious little animals too. They’re very curious. Hey, you know how people always ask, “Why did the chicken cross the road?” I think I know, now that I have chickens. It’s their innate sense of adventure. [audience laughs] [chortles] [audience laughs] I’m sorry to be just another comedian going on and on about her chickens. [audience laughs] Another thing about chickens is that, um… [audience laughs] …they… they fly. People think they’re flightless birds, and that is not true. They do fly. The longest recorded chicken flight is 13 seconds. Isn’t that amazing? Someone thought to time that. [audience laughs] Yeah. Also, chickens dream. Scientists have discovered that chickens dream. Now listen, I love animals more than anyone, but we could take scientists working on chicken dreams and move them on over to climate change. [audience laughing and cheering] I’m not saying that chicken dreaming is not worth studying, it is. But we don’t need our top minds on it, I don’t think. I am curious. What do they dream about? Probably the same things we do. Probably flying. But 14 or 15 seconds for them, you know. Mm. That’s all for chickens. [audience laughs] Yeah. Got to save some for the memoir. [audience laughs] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [cheering and applause] Yeah. Let me see what else I can tell you about that has been going on. Chickens… [audience laughs] [audience laughs] Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. [audience laughs] Yeah. Yeah. [audience cheering] Thanks. Yeah, ’cause I’m mean. Yeah. You can’t be mean and be in show business. No, they’ll kick you out. No mean people in show business. I’m out. Yeah, y’all heard I was mean. Everybody heard that I was mean. Everywhere I go, I know everyone’s heard that I’m mean. I know when I walk into a restaurant, people are watching, waiting to see if I’ll be mean. [audience laughs] [applause] “Do you think she’ll be mean first and then dance?” [audience laughs] “Look, she… Oh, she’s reaching for butter.” [audience laughs] “I thought she was gonna hit somebody.” “All right, I’m gonna eat. You watch now.” [inhales] That was a big story, huh? That had some legs on it. The first I heard about it, I… I came across a headline that said, “How Ellen DeGeneres became the most hated person in America.” Now, I didn’t see the other names on the ballot, but I have to… [audience laughs] [audience cheering loudly] Yeah. It’s… It’s an impressive title, it really is. It’s a… It’s a horrible thing to say about somebody, and to make it worse, there was no trophy, no awards banquet, nothing. Just the title, just, you know… I made a sash at home and I wore that around, just to… to feel like I had something, you know? It was quite a shock to me because for 17 years, there were all these polls basically saying I was one of the most trusted people in the country. There was a poll that asked people, “Which celebrity would you most want to babysit your child?” And I was the number one answer. [applause] [audience cheering] Because when you think “good with kids,” you immediately think childless, lesbian stand-up comedian. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] Once they heard that I might be mean, they didn’t want me to babysit anymore. So it wasn’t all bad. [chuckles] No. I was in therapy for a while trying to deal with all the hatred coming at me, and it was not a common situation for a therapist to deal with. My therapist said, “Ellen, where do you get this idea that everyone hates you?” And I said, “Well, um, New York Times, Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly, Us Weekly.” “I think Elmo may have said something recently on an episode of Sesame Street.” She said, “You just need to avoid looking at the news, just avoid media.” And I was like, “I am. I’m not looking at anything.” I would know when something was going on because I’d start getting text from friends saying, “Thinking of you,” or, “Sending love.” And I’d be like, “Oh.” “Why do I need love sent?” “The ‘be kind’ girl wasn’t kind.” That was the headline. Here’s the problem. I’m a comedian who got a talk show, and I ended the show every day by saying, “Be kind to one another.” [audience cheering] Yeah. I know. It seemed like a good idea. But I became a brand, a one-dimensional character who gave stuff away and danced every day up steps. Do you know how hard it was to dance up steps? Would a mean person dance up steps? I don’t think so. Had I ended my show by saying, “Go fuck yourselves…” [audience laughs] [audience cheering] …people would have been pleasantly surprised to find out I’m kind. [audience laughs] I loved that show. I loved everything about that show. It was a family to me. Here’s something sweet. Sixteen people who worked there started out straight, and by the time they left, were gay. [audience laughs] Yeah. You don’t see Jimmy Kimmel doing those kind of numbers. [audience laughs] You know what’s funny, is that when I first came out, people were afraid that watching my show would turn people gay. Which is ridiculous. You have to work there. You have to fill out a W-2. And then, you turn gay. We had so much fun together at that show. We laughed all the time. We played games all the time. I started a game of tag in, like, 2016 that we played all the way till when the show ended ’cause I just loved playing games. We played tag, and I would chase people down the hallways, I would chase them around the studio and scare them all the time. I would jump out, scare people ’cause I would love to do that, and… Hearing myself say this out loud, I… realize I was chasing my employees and terrorizing them. I can see where that would be misinterpreted. Well… We had morning meetings every morning in my office. The producers would come in, writers would come in, and we’d talk about what we were gonna do on the show that day. And Andy Lassner was one of my executive producers. [audience cheering] Yeah. Uh, Andy is a very nervous man, and he… Everything scares him. He could drop his pen and it would startle him. He’s just a nervous man. And Alison was one of my writers who was scared of snakes. Anything snake-related. So, sometimes, before they’d come into my office, we would hide rubber snakes in a panel in the ceiling, and I had a button that I could push that would release the snakes down… [audience exclaims] Again, hearing myself say this out loud… But they liked it. [chuckles] They did. There are a lot of perks with having your own television show. Number one has to be the ability to say to someone, “We should have a panel in the ceiling that releases snakes.” [audience laughs] And then another adult says, “Yeah, we’ll get that started right away.” Scaring was just a big component of the show. We would… You know, we started with scaring guests, and I don’t remember exactly how it started. It was some simple, like… I think Chris Hemsworth, or some big strong guy that was on the show, we found out was scared of crickets. So we had someone dress as a cricket and sneak up behind his chair when he was talking, and… [roars] …you know, make a cricket noise and scare him. And then it just escalated. We just decided to make it more surprising to people, and, eventually, we, uh, built a table that looked like the table between me and the guest, but it was actually a box where someone could pop out and scare them. But the guests got wise to that, and if they saw that it was a box, they would open it and look in the box. So we built a tunnel under the stage that went into the box… so that when they checked it, it was empty, and then they’d close it, and somebody would crawl into the box from underneath. I was a very immature boss. [audience laughs] I didn’t want to be a boss. I didn’t go to business school. I went to Charlie’s Chuckle Hut. It looked like I was the boss. The show is called Ellen, and everybody’s wearing T-shirts that say Ellen, and there were buildings all over the Warner Bros. lot that said Ellen. But I don’t think that meant that I should be in charge. I don’t think that Ronald McDonald’s the CEO of McDonald’s. [applause] [audience cheering] Everything I knew about being a boss, I learned from movies. And those were things like saying, “Jenkins, my office, now!” Or, “The name’s Frank, how the hell are you?” But those were men bosses. Women bosses didn’t come along for a while, not till around the time of Martinizing, I think. [audience laughs] No. But men bosses and women bosses are different. Like, a woman boss couldn’t say, “Jenkins, my office, now.” A woman boss would have to use more words. A woman boss would have to say something like, “Excuse me, Jenkins. I don’t want to bother you.” “If you’re not too busy, could you step into my office real quick?” “I just have to talk to you for a second. Thank you so much.” [audience cheering] ‘Cause women are raised in a different way. At least I was. I was raised to be a people pleaser. I was taught, when I was a little girl, to be small and quiet and agreeable. And it’s crazy what I’ve done with my life, ’cause I’m exactly the opposite of how I was raised to be. [audience cheering] Yeah. Most women aren’t raised with confidence. We just aren’t. We’re too self-conscious, which is why you rarely see a woman playing air guitar. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] I love how they make it like it’s hard. Like something’s happening there. Men can get away with acting out things that aren’t actually happening and not look crazy, somehow. A man, in the middle of nowhere, and for no reason, can practice an imaginary golf swing. Just… [audience laughs] [audience cheering] “Oh, no, I’m not in line.” “I’m just waiting for my latte. You go ahead.” [chuckles] Men’ll jump up and see if they can slap the top of a doorframe. [audience laughs] I’ve never had that urge. “I wonder if I could hit that?” “Tiffany, hold my purse. I’m gonna give it a try.” [audience cheering] [groans] “I couldn’t do it! I didn’t. Give me my purse. I didn’t do it.” Good. We have all these unwritten rules based on gender, of acceptable behavior, of who we’re allowed to be and how we’re allowed to act. If we don’t follow those rules, it makes people uncomfortable. When people get uncomfortable, there are consequences. For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business. [audience laughs and cheers] Yeah. Kicked me out before ’cause I told them I was gay. No gay people in show business. [audience laughs] No. They’ll kick you out. Can’t be gay and be in show business. Eventually, they’re gonna kick me out a third time for being old. Mean, old, and gay. The triple crown. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] I knew it was a risk to tell people I was gay ’cause I knew a lot of people didn’t like gay people. If they did, we wouldn’t have needed the parade. Listen, we don’t like all of you either, but we don’t make a big thing about it. [audience cheering] Most of us get into this business because we didn’t get enough love or attention as a child. So we go into a business that depends on people liking us to be successful. What’s wrong with us? [chuckles] For me, it was never about the money. It was about healing my childhood wounds. I thought if I could make people happy, then they’ll like me. And if they like me, I’ll feel good about myself. And all I can say about that is, “Thank God for the money.” [audience laughs] ‘Cause it’s a fickle business. They liked me for a long time. I was on a sitcom, I made them laugh. They liked me, then I told them I was gay, and they didn’t like me. Then I got a talk show, and I gave them TVs and cars, and I danced, and they liked me. Then they heard a rumor I was mean, they didn’t like me. So it’s been a real test for my ego and my self-esteem because there’s such extremes in this business. There are people who love you and idolize you, and then there are people who hate you, just really loudly hate you. So, sometimes, I long for my childhood, when I just had good old-fashioned neglect. [audience laughs] What was wrong with that? [chuckles] It’s been two years since the show ended and it’s been an adjustment, because for 19 years, I drove onto the Warner Bros. lot, passed a giant billboard of my face. So the first thing I did was I had a giant billboard of my face installed on my lawn, so I saw that when I drove in. Yeah, then I put an “applause” sign in the dining room, and that’s helping also. But, really, I’ve only known myself working for 40 years. That’s all I’ve done, is work. So I didn’t really have a lot of free time and didn’t have hobbies. Now there’s a lot of free time, so I’m trying to figure out what to do with that. So I got the chickens, remember? I don’t know if you… Yeah. I decided to take up gardening ’cause everybody talks about gardening and how great gardening is. It’s not. [audience laughs] No. It’s really not. I got the overalls and the tool belt and the hat. I looked adorable. I did. But I find once you put the plants in the ground, you’re no longer gardening. You’re just waiting, you know? I tell people I grew these strawberries, but at best I was just there when it happened. It’s the sun and the sprinklers that should take the credit. I’m more like the strawberries’ godmother showing up on its birthday. “Look how big you’re getting.” [audience laughs] “See you at Christmas, maybe.” It is relaxing to be out there, though. Mainly ’cause the garden gloves make it impossible for me to look at my phone. Yeah. Sometimes, I’ll put the garden gloves on and go inside and lay down. Yeah. It’s just as relaxing, really. My garden gloves and my sweatpants… I live in sw… When I’m at home, I just wear sweatpants. I don’t understand people who don’t just wear sweatpants at home. Like, what’s the point, you know? [audience cheering] Yeah. I take off my going-out clothes. I take those off, put on my staying-home clothes. Once I’m in my sweatpants, I’m not leaving. Not leaving the house. A few weeks ago, a friend of mine texted me, and he said, “Would you like to come over for a last-minute dinner party for Mick?” As in Jagger. [audience exclaims] Now, I’ve never met Mick Jagger, and I would love to meet Mick Jagger, but I was in my sweatpants already, and I was not leaving. [audience cheering] That’s what I told him, and he could not believe that was the reason I wasn’t going. I guess most people would make something up because it is a ridiculous reason, and I know that, but it was the truth. You know? And, you know, people say honesty is the best policy. I don’t know why they say that. It’s only the best policy if it’s something you want to hear, really. Like, there are certain degrees of honesty. If you tell someone there’s something stuck in their teeth, they don’t love that, but they kind of appreciate that and they’ll take that. But as soon as you tell someone that all of their stories should be 50% shorter… [audience laughs] Yeah. [audience cheering] …you lose 100% of their friendship, is what happens. People say it’s hard to tell the truth. For me, it’s hard not to tell the truth. Which is why it was really difficult for me to keep my sexuality a secret, because I felt such guilt for not being honest about who I was. I felt shame for how society was making me feel. I felt fear for what would happen to my career if I did come out. Ultimately, I decided it’s more important for me to be honest about who I am. [audience cheering] Yeah. Yeah. They say, “The truth will set you free,” and it did. I was free for three years. [audience laughs] Nobody would hire me. Truth will make you broke. People lie so much these days, they really do. You can tell, because they make such a big deal of it when they’re telling the truth. They’ll say things like, “Well, to tell you the truth…” or, “If I’m being honest…” If you’re being honest? I prefer it the other way around. “Listen, I’m gonna lie to you here.” [audience laughs] “That lasagna was phenomenal.” [audience laughs] Most people tell me that they appreciate my honesty because they know where they stand with me, but someone did suggest that I get tested to see if I’m on the spectrum. And, uh, I’m not on the spectrum. And I wouldn’t care if I was on the spectrum, but I’m not. Well, I am on the spectrum. [audience laughs] We all are. It’s a spectrum. [audience laughing and cheering] I’m on the part of the spectrum where someone on the spectrum would have a problem with me saying I’m on the spectrum, so… Yeah, that’s right. But I may have OCD because a therapist said so. And I said, “Yes, I am very organized,” because I thought that was the “O.” [audience laughs] I didn’t know what OCD was. I was raised in a religion, Christian Science, that doesn’t acknowledge diseases or disorders. So, when I was growing up, nobody talked about anything. There was no discussion of anything. I look back now, and I realize my dad for sure had OCD. He would check the doorknob 15 times before we would leave. He would check the faucet 15 times. He would unplug all the appliances before we left the house because lightning could strike, and it would catch fire. They say it could be hereditary. So I went home and I asked Portia, I said, “Do you think I may have OCD?” And she said, “Yes, you do.” [audience laughs] Barely got that sentence out, really. It’s funny, I’ve never thought of myself as obsessive. I think of myself as careful, and everyone else careless and out of control. [audience laughs] I asked her what I obsess about, and she said, “You obsess about time.” And that is true. I don’t like to be late. I like to be on time. So, sometimes, that makes us early. This is the example she said I should share with you. I, um… There are many, but this is the one she said. Usher was having an after-party for the Grammys one year, and we got there so early, it was just us and the staff. [audience laughs] Yup. Yup. We helped place candles on tables. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] [chuckles] I invoiced him $200. These are my confessions. I just don’t know why the invitation says a certain time for a party to start, and then everyone goes an hour or two later. People seem to think that 6:00 means 7:00, 7:00 means 8:00, 8:00 means 9:00. 9:00 means nothing to me, ’cause I’m not going. [audience laughs] 9:00. Who starts something at 9:00? Anyway, I obsess on time, and, uh, I obsess on animals. I know I obsess on animals ’cause I love them too much. Like, way too much. I think about how they see things and what they feel and what they think. And I worry about butterflies in rainstorms, and how delicate they are, and how their little tiny feet are holding on to a blade of grass, trying to… Winds blowing… The rain is happening on their little tiny wings… Saturating their wings, and their feet holding… Especially if it’s a butterfly. What if it’s his first day, and they’re, like, “Is this life? This is horrible.” Ooh… [chuckling] “I should have stayed a caterpillar.” [audience laughs] [chuckling] The monarch butterfly, think about that. How crazy is that story? You know the story. I don’t have to tell you. But I will. The little tiny caterpillar… [audience laughs] I mean, how does it even make it past the caterpillar stage? It’s a larva, and then that somehow gets into a caterpillar. And a caterpillar just… And somehow, it just knows instinctively it’s time for that part of its life to change. “That’s done. I’m gonna put myself into a chrysalis.” And then it turns into liquid somehow. And then it becomes a butterfly flying for the first time. And it looks drunk and confused, the way they, you know… [audience laughs] And they make it to Mexico that way. I don’t know how. [audience cheering] The butterfly is beautiful, and people talk about the butterfly, but the butterfly wouldn’t be the butterfly without the caterpillar. I mean, the deep knowing that that caterpillar has. Its only perspective is crawling on the ground and it’s looking at other crawling things saying, “I’m gonna fly someday.” “And I’m gonna go to Mexico.” And they’re like, “No, you’re not.” “And what’s Mexico?” But I don’t know if we really fully appreciate what that metamorphosis is. The fact that it’s a caterpillar, it knows to change and becomes this other thing entirely. That’s genius. It’s brilliance. And the octopus, the octopus being able to change texture and shape and form and color instantaneously, depending on what it’s on. That’s genius. A colony of ants or of bees, the way they communicate, and there’s no chaos between all of those things. Everything in nature is living up to its full potential. But I am so disappointed in pigeons. [audience laughs] What happened to them? I mean, pigeons, they have built-in GPS in their beaks. And they can fly for hundreds of miles. In World War II, they saved lives. They were taking messages from generals to other generals and saving lives. There are pictures of them in the newspaper with medals, not pinned, but around their necks, that they received for what they did in World War II, and now look at them. Just pecking at old gum in filthy alleyways and parking lots. They could be anywhere. I would feel sorry for them, but they made a choice. [audience laughs] I mean, they barely fly anymore. They… They’re just, uh, filthy. And even if a car is coming, they don’t even fly to get out of the way. “All right. Okay, all right. Okay!” “All right. Okay, okay, all right. Okay!” [applause] [audience cheering] Sometimes, it looks like they’re gonna do something important. You’ll see a bunch, and they all get up at once. Again, that kind of communication. All of them get up at once, they fly, and they just go in one big circle, and they go right back to where they were. God, you guys. Not living up to their potential. I rescued a pigeon one time. I’ll rescue anything. I’ve always tried to save animals my whole life. But I saw a one-legged pigeon on the street near where I lived, and I took it home because I knew it wasn’t gonna make it on the street and I didn’t know how to take care of it. I mean, never had a pigeon, so I just threw gum and trash down… [audience laughs] …dirt, thinking that’s what it eats. You know, because I’ve never seen it… It didn’t make it. I’ll rescue anything. I really will. And if I see a sign of someone posting a cat or a dog missing, when they post those pictures, I will drive around and I will try to find that animal. And it’s not just for the reward money. [audience laughs] It’s not. No. I rescued a dog one time. I was driving, and I see this dog all by itself, and I get out of the car, and it’s soaking wet. I’m like, “Oh my God, what happened to you?” Take it home, dry it off, stays with me for the night. Put out posters the next afternoon. Get a call from the people saying, “Thank God. Where did you find it?” And I told them, and they said, “That’s where we live.” [audience laughs] Yeah. They said, “We had just given it a bath, and we put her on the lawn to dry out.” It was pretty close to the sidewalk when I saw it. [chuckles] Anyway, I obsess on things. I have ADD, and I blame the talk show for that because for 19 years, I was talking to people in five-minute segments. When I’m at a party and someone’s talking to me longer than five minutes, I have the urge to say, “I’m sorry, we have to take a break.” [audience laughs] [audience cheering] Parties are hard for me. Parties are very hard for me. People are wanting to talk and stuff, and… [inhales] They always talk about books they’re reading. I don’t read. I want to. I try to read, but my ADD makes it really hard for me. As much as I try to focus on the words, I end up thinking about a sandwich I had earlier that day. Moby Dick, for me, is two pages about a whale and 425 pages about me wondering if I should grow my hair out or keep it short. [audience laughs] I’ve had it short for a while. I should try to grow it out, probably. Maybe to my shoulder-length or something like that. Not much longer than that. I wonder how long that would take, though? I should probably keep it short, I think. That’s better. Why not try something different, though? I should. Oh, yeah. Oh, it’s done. Yeah. [audience cheering] Yeah, my ADD makes it really hard for me to sit down and focus on anything at all. Like, do you know how hard it was for me to put this together? Of course you don’t. Why would I ask that question? Why do people ask people questions they know they don’t have the answer to? Why do people say, “Guess what I did yesterday?” Do I have to? Is it a game? Is there a prize? I don’t want to. “You’ll never guess what I did yesterday.” You’re right, I won’t. I won’t. Probably not. Unless it’s something really average, like you had lunch. You said I’ll never guess, so it’s probably something weird, like you got a chinchilla and named it “Stewart.” I don’t know. So it’s hard for me to focus, and I get, like… When I was thinking about pigeons and how disappointed I was in them, I was… I remembered that I had rescued the pigeon ’cause I’d forgotten. I was like, “Yeah, I rescued that one-legged pigeon.” And when I wrote down “legged,” I did the hyphen thing, and I thought, “leg-ged” or “legged”? Is it “legged”? “One-leg-ged”? “One-legged” pigeon or “one-leg-ged”? It’s not “one arm-med.” You don’t “one arm-med.” Armed. But it’s two Gs, so “leg-ged”? You don’t go, “I beg-ged for food.” No. You don’t stay, “I got mug-ged.” It’s “leg-ged.” Or “legged.” “One-leg pigeon.” “One-legged”? “One-leg-ged.” “One-leg pigeon.” “One-leg-ged.” “One-leg pigeon”? “One-leg-ged pigeon.” A one-leg… “One-leg-ged.” “One-leg pigeon.” “One-leg-ged” pigeon. [audience cheering] So, I have ADD. I have OCD. I’m losing my memory. But I think I’m well-adjusted because I obsess on things but don’t have the attention span to stick with it, then I forget what I was obsessing about in the first place. So it takes me all the way around to being well-adjusted, I think. Yeah. [applause] [chuckles] I’m very impatient. That is a problem for me. I’m very impatient. It’s hard for me to live in the moment. We’re supposed to live in the moment. But every moment… Eh… The spiritual teacher Ram Dass wrote a book called Be Here Now. I’d like to write one for people with ADD and call it, Yeah, but What’s That over There? [audience laughs] There are all these books out there telling us how to live, telling us why we’re here. ‘Cause why are we here, really? I mean, obviously, to gossip and make fun of each other on the internet, but why else? These things I think about now that I’m older. I’m 66 years old, and I… [audience cheering] Thank you. That’s how you know you’re old, you get the applause. [audience laughs] You don’t get it when you’re 30, or even in your 50s. It starts around 60. So I don’t like the word “old.” I think it’s a bad word. It just sounds bad. “Old.” “Is that bread still good?” “No, that’s old.” “Old.” And I don’t feel old. The only time I feel old is when I’m in a restaurant trying to read a menu. That is the only time I feel old. Yeah. [applause] You know all the reasons. It’s like, too dark in there. It’s always too dark. And the way they think they’re gonna help, they put a tealight candle on the table. Which does nothing. I blow it out. I just blow it out and, “Oh, okay.” You’re gonna light it again? All right, I’m just gonna… Because it doesn’t do anything. That’s why. Why are you lighting… Okay, I’ll do it again. I’m just gonna put it in my pocket. How about that? You can’t see. And if you put your flashlight on your phone to try to read the menu, that just automatically says, “Old.” That’s just… That’s… They should come with a sound effect. When you put the flashlight on… “Old!” It should just be “Old!” And even if you can see, the print is so small. I don’t know who is printing these menus, but the print is so tiny. It’s like they’re using a jeweler’s loupe to make the font. It’s tiny, tiny font. You can’t read it. I’m like, “Can you see that?” “Does that say ‘tortilla’ or ‘trampoline?’ What does that say to you?” “I can’t see anything. Yeah.” “Hi. Okay, I’ll go ahead and order. “I’m gonna get the pasta with stem cells.” [audience laughs] They have a children’s menu. They should have a larger-print menu for older people with a bendy light so you can see it. [audience cheering] Or, even better, they should come out in audiobook. A menu could be an audio… Meryl Streep reads The Cheesecake Factory. “Pancakes.” [chuckling] [chuckling] I don’t do impressions, that’s… “Pancakes.” When you’re this age, the doctors start asking you to come in for checkups. Even though there’s nothing wrong with you, they just want to see you. It’s a scam. They’re just looking for stuff. They ask you all kinds of personal stuff. “How many drinks per week do you have?” First of all, it’s none of your business. [audience cheering] Second of all, I’m gonna lie to you here. Three. [audience laughs] “Drinks per week.” How about I start with “per day” before I do that math, okay? “Carry the two.” They just look for stuff. My doctor said, “When’s the last time you had a bone density test?” And I said, “A what?” “Bone density test.” I said, “I’ve never had a bone density test.” “Well, at your age, you should get one.” I said, “Why? I’m in good shape.” “No, you should get one at your age.” So I got the stupid bone density test. I’m off the charts. Below it. I have full-on osteoporosis. I don’t even know how I’m standing up right now. [audience laughs] I’m like a human sandcastle. I could disintegrate in the shower. I have to take that Prolia shot every six months. Remember the commercial where the woman’s walking and a kid darts out on the skateboard or something… “Whoa!” “Whoa!” That’s me. It’s hard to be honest about aging and seem cool. Hey, if you got arthritis in your knee, make some noise! [audience cheering] Oh! Me, too. I just had excruciating pain one day, and I thought I tore a ligament or something. I got the MRI, and they’re, like, “No, it’s just arthritis.” I said, “How’d I get that?” He goes, “It just happens at your age.” All these things just happen at your age. It’s around the time you start watching Wheel of Fortune. [audience laughs] Yeah. There’s no buildup, you just find yourself sitting there enjoying it one day. “That’s a pretty gown Vanna’s wearing.” The prizes are tricky on there, I find. I think they really are. I had a 20-minute conversation about this the other day. If you land on the dollar amount, the $300, or the $1,500, you get that, right? But if you land on the car. Honk, honk! Half a car, by the way. You’re trying to land on the million dollars, that’s what you want. But the million dollars is sandwiched in between two bankrupts. If you freeze-frame it, you’ll notice that the bankrupts are a little bit larger than the sliver of the million dollars. You’ll see when you freeze-frame it, it’s just… When you land on it, you’re like, “I got a million dollars!” But no, you don’t. You have to have so many other things that line up to get that, which I was telling myself when Portia walked in and said, “Who are you talking to?” [audience laughs] [applause] [chuckles] Another thing that happens when you age, you just start talking to yourself. I’d probably be doing this exact same thing right now if you weren’t here. [audience laughs] Aging is very interesting. Aging is tough on its own, but aging… Then you have aging parents, which a lot of people are dealing with now, which is really, really tough. My father is no longer with us. Well, he was never with you, um… [audience laughs] [chuckles] My mother has dementia now, and, um… which is a horrible disease. And so many people are dealing with it right now. My mother is lucky in the sense that she doesn’t know she has it. So she’s actually happy. She’s really happy. She’s in a really nice place. I have her in, uh… a facility that… They have a lot of activities to keep them stimulated. There’s painting, and arts and crafts, and bus rides, and different things that happen, um… I don’t know whose idea this was, but someone booked a magician. [audience laughs] He… [chuckles] He was so excited to be there. He was wearing a tuxedo that fit him at one point in his life, and… he’s sitting, and he’s got a table. Thirteen women in different stages of dementia, and… “Pick a card.” [audience laughs] Eh? “I can’t see it. What is it?” “It’s a queen of hearts.” “No, don’t tell her. I want you to look at it, and just…” “You just look at that and remember it, okay.” “All right.” “Put it back in the deck now.” He goes through the whole thing. “Is this your card?” “No.” “Yes, it is!” [audience laughs] “Yes!” “That’s your card!” “No.” “You picked that card. Put it back in.” Oh, he got so mad. He just… He didn’t even have to do anything. He could have left the room and come back. “Oh, a magician!” You know, they would have been like… [chuckling] God… [chuckles] [chuckles] It’s always interesting having a conversation with her. You never know what you’re gonna get. And not too long ago, she said, “You didn’t go to college, did you?” I said, “No.” She goes, “That’s a shame. I would have been so proud of you.” [audience laughs] I said, “Well, I think I did okay.” “I had that show you liked. Remember the show?” “Yeah, I still watch it every day.” I said, “No, I don’t think so, um…” “Yeah, I watch it every day.” I said, “No, it’s not on anymore.” And she goes, “Then, who am I watching?” [audience laughs] “Kelly Clarkson. Judge Judy. I don’t know.” “Well, yesterday’s was very good. It was the best one yet.” Okay. You know, I realize now that my whole life was wrapped up in that show, and my mother’s whole identity was being Ellen’s mom. And now I don’t have a show, and she doesn’t know she’s my mom. She just thinks I’m a nice lady that visits her. Although, there’s a good chance she thinks I’m Kelly Ripa, but… [audience laughs] But she’s happy, and that’s all that matters. [audience cheering] And I’m happy too. [audience cheering] Uh… Yeah. I’m happy not being a boss or a brand or a billboard, just a person. Just a multifaceted person with different feelings and emotions, and I can be happy and sad and compassionate or frustrated. I have OCD and ADD. I’m honest. I’m generous. I’m sensitive and thoughtful. But I’m tough and I’m impatient and I’m demanding. I’m direct. I’m a strong woman. [audience cheering] [mouthing] Thank you. [cheering continues] Thank you. Thank you so much. I’m proud of who I’ve become. When you’re a public figure, you’re open to everyone’s interpretation. I’m sure you’ve heard the saying, “What other people think of me is none of my business.” People will say all kinds of things, and you have no control over that. But you know the truth, and that’s all that matters. But that is easier said than done because being in this business, I have had to care what people think. Because being a comedian or a host, it’s our only real currency for success. If they like you, you’re in, and if they don’t, you’re out. And I’ve spent an entire lifetime trying to make people happy, and I’ve cared far too much what other people think of me. So the thought of anyone thinking that I’m mean was devastating to me, and it consumed me for a long time. But with time, you gain perspective, which is one good thing about aging. It doesn’t totally make up for arthritis and brittle bones, but… [audience laughs] But with perspective, you realize that caring what people think, to a degree, is healthy. But not if it affects your mental health. [audience cheering] So after a lifetime of caring, I just can’t anymore. So I don’t. [audience cheering] But, if I’m being honest… [audience laughs] …and I have a choice of people remembering me as someone who is mean, or someone who is beloved. “Belove-ed”? “Beloved”? [audience laughs] Beloved. Someone who is beloved? Someone who is “belove-ed.” Beloved. “Beloved-ed.” Someone who’s beloved. Someone who is “beloved-ed.” Someone who is beloved. I choose that. Thank you. [audience cheering] [whooping] Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Have a seat. Thank you so much. Wow. Wow. [audience whooping] Well… Wow. Um… First of all… First of all, that was just, um, unbelievably beautiful, and, um… You know, there is just nothing better than being surrounded by endorphins and joy, and we don’t get that that often now, and this was beautiful tonight. This was absolutely… [audience cheering] I, um… [clears throat] I had no intention of doing a special. I had no intention of doing anything ever again after the show. And I really, uh… I didn’t think I’d ever find the funny in it. And the fact that I have been able to travel and do this and see the love and support that is still there for me, which I didn’t know I had. [audience cheering] Um… It is… It’s been… It’s been beyond healing to say the words every night, to-to feel the support and the love. And so I am so glad I got to do this. I’m so glad I got to say goodbye on my terms, and I can’t thank you enough. [audience cheering] Um… This is a night I will always remember. And, uh, I… I just… I just… Thank you. And I just want to bring my wife out here ’cause it’s our anniversary. [audience cheering] [“Golden” by Jill Scott playing] She’s crying… [cheering continues] Thank you, everybody.

Hello, Los Angeles. How y’all doing? [cheering and applause] Thank you for coming out. I’d like to just jump into the shit if you don’t mind. Y’all good with that? [cheering] [man] Yes, sir!

[audience laughing] And I widen them out so they can hold on to the… [audience laughing] I gotta find a lamp to hold that motherfucker up, just… [audience laughing] Eight hours, I hear… [cell phone charging sound] [low battery warning sound] [audience laughing] [charging sound] [low battery warning sound] [audience continues laughing] Ain’t fucking with no more women who don’t have a parking space in front of they building. [audience laughing] I’mma circle your block two times. [audience laughing] If I don’t see a space, I’m outta there, motherfucker. I ain’t be fucking around with you and your shady-ass neighborhood, motherfucker. I just saw a grown man on a bike and dress shoes and shit. [audience laughing] Know that n*gga up to no good. [audience laughing] You ever date an aggressive woman? I-I would think it would be similar to having a boyfriend. I think I had a boyfriend. [audience laughing] This motherfucker took me hooping one day. Didn’t even choose me to be on her team. [audience laughing] Out there cheering this b*tch on with these n*ggas. [audience laughing] Every time we pray, her hands go first like this and mine like… [audience laughing] Trying to turn my hands over. This strong b*tch like… [audience laughing] B*tch, I can’t… I-I-I can’t reach the Lord feeling like a b*tch like this. [clicks tongue] “Fuck it. Just come on. Pray. Just pray over the food. Just…” [audience laughing] I ain’t having sex with no more women over the age of 40 with baby hair on they face. [surprised reactions, laughter] I don’t even have no punchline. Just thought I’d tell you that. [audience laughing] See how I lost half the audience on that? [audience laughs] “Ah! Uh…” [audience laughing] This woman blew a kiss to me the other day… [blows kiss] And I caught it. Then I heard… [clears throat] I look behind me. This big Black dude just staring at me and shit. I was like, “Goddamn, I done caught this n*gga’s kiss.” [audience laughing] “There you go, dawg. My fault.” “I didn’t mean to do that. I jumped… got ahead of myself.” I’m done fucking around with women with fat asses. I had a good run. [audience laughing] It’s just a lot of… a lot of stress. They everywhere, you know? They ain’t even special no more. Everybody got one and shit, you know? I shouldn’t be going through what I’m going through if everybody got one. That’s the way I think about it, you know. And it’s stressful when you be out with a woman with a fat ass. Everybody be looking at that ass, and you gotta act like you don’t see them looking at it. [audience laughing] Plus the amount of toilet paper they use is ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. [audience laughing] I had just put out a fresh roll, right? [audience laughing] Like, “still stuck to the other toilet paper” fresh. This motherfucker was at my house three hours. When she left, it was just the cardboard spinning in that motherfucker. “What is this b*tch doing with my toilet paper?” [audience laughing] I caught her one day just wrapping that shit. Just… [audience laughing] ACE-bandage style, n*gga, just… [audience laughing] I kicked the door in, like, “B*tch, close your hand and save me some sheets.” [audience laughing] Fellas, you ever be in the club and see three women walking together? Sometimes they hold hands. Sometimes they don’t. The pretty one always first. I wanna speak to all the third women in the house tonight. [audience laughing] You know who you are. When a n*gga like me grab you in the club, you stop and see what the fuck I want. [audience laughing] I’m sick of this disrespectful shit. Following that pretty b*tch around the club. She gonna get hers. I’m trying to make you the leader of your own pack of biscuits. [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] N*gga, I’m grabbing the third one. I’m like, “Third Chick, come on.” “Don’t… don’t do that to me, Third Chick. Come on, now. Come on.” “I gotta follow them.” “Man, don’t you let them hos block your blessings.” [audience laughing] I know why pretty girls always have that one ugly girl with them too. Because while Number One and Number Two dance, they need somebody watch they coats and purses. Don’t lie to me. I see it all the time. Don’t lie to me. Number One and Number Two be on the dance floor. [laughs] “Hey!” [laughs] Third B*tch putting napkins over drinks and… covering their coats and purses. Phone out. “Go, besties!” [audience laughing] I be at the table right next to her like, “You ain’t gotta live like this your whole life.” [audience laughing] “Come with me, Third B*tch.” [audience laughing] Black women hate to see a Black man with a white woman, boy. Hate that. Look at ’em, clapping and shit. [audience laughing] If you see a Black man out in public with a white woman, especially if it’s a group of Black women, they group together and talk about ’em. “Look at this Black ass over there with that white b*tch.” [audience laughing] “Can’t handle a strong Black sister, can he?” [audience laughing] Why all our women gotta be strong and shit? “Strong Black sister.” I don’t want no strong Black sister. Forget that. You put that out there in the world. When you come home, if I live with you, don’t you bring strong shit in the house. [audience laughing] You save that for the world and shit. I don’t want no strong Black sister and shit in the house. “You want some spaghetti?” [audience laughing] “From a strong Black sister?” “I’ll season it the way you want it seasoned.” “I swear to God, you’ll love it.” [audience laughing] “You want some head?” [audience laughing] “From a strong Black sister?” “I’ll suck it good. I’ll suck it for all my ancestors.” “Just suck it out.” “I swear I won’t let you down.” [audience laughing] I don’t want no strong head, motherfucker. [audience laughing] Black men don’t give a fuck when we see Black women with white men. We don’t care. Actually, I be congratulating them too. I be like this. “Hey, get your credit together, baby. That’s it. [audience laughing] Black men don’t give no fuck. You’ll never see a group of Black men gathering together to talk about, “Look at her Black ass over there with that cracker!” [audience laughing] “Can’t handle a real n*gga, can ya, b*tch?” [audience laughing] I caught two DUIs four days apart. I just didn’t take the first one seriously and shit. [audience laughing] $15,000, classes, and lawyer fees later and shit, what they did was they put this thing in my car called a BAIID. A BAIID is a device you have to blow in in order to start your car, and it shows if you intoxicated or not. If you ain’t intoxicated, you start your car and you can go. You blow in it every ten minutes to prove it’s you. It’s a very embarrassing device. Anytime anybody got in my car, I would lie and be like, “Yeah, that’s a new alarm system I got.” [audience laughs] “You gotta blow in it every ten minutes?” I’m like, “Yeah. N*ggas are stealing Oldsmobiles bad.” [audience laughing] One Sunday, two in the afternoon, I’m running around doing errands and shit. I ain’t drinking, nothing, you know. Stopped in an Arbee’s, eat a sandwich, got in the car, blew in the motherfucker, and it registered as if I was drinking. I was shook. They can lock me back up and impound my car. I called the county. “Dude, I was not drinking.” “I don’t know what the… why this shit register like this.” “You ain’t been drinking?” I said, “Nah.” “What did you eat?” “A sandwich.” They was like, “Did it have poppy seeds on it? And I was like, “Yeah,” and they was like, “Yeah, that’s the problem with these BAIID devices.” “They read poppy seeds as if you intoxicated.” “That’s what they make opium out of.” “Don’t worry. We’ll take it off your record.” “Start your car. You can be on your way.” And I was like, “Really?” [audience laughing] Three that morning, I call that n*gga again, like, “I ate another sandwich.” [audience laughing] “Goddamn poppy seeds on everything.” [audience laughing] “Can you start my car?” [audience laughing] When Black people cheat, like, when we dip off with somebody else, you know, we like to go to white establishments. [audience laughing] ‘Cause we know ain’t no Black people there to see us. [audience laughing] I was with this girl one day. She was like, “Why you got me at this medieval castle?” [audience laughing] “You said you was open-minded, right?” “Put that crown on, eat that turkey leg, and shut the fuck up.” [audience laughing] Fellas, you ever have a threesome? One of the girls is fine as hell, and the other one is not. But she’s so fine that you gotta bring the other one along. I did that before. I’ll never do it again. Me and the fine one, we locked in. We getting it in, zoned out. All of a sudden, I feel these cold hands coming up my back. [audience roaring with laughter] [laughter continues] “Save me some dick.” [audience laughing] “There ain’t gonna be no more dick after this.” “Dick… dick… dick… dick gonna run out after this, I think.” [audience laughing] I like to have sex with women with kids. ‘Cause they leave. [audience laughing] Get up, go to the bathroom. I come back. She be like, “Hey, I gotta get on out of here and get him ready for school tomorrow.” [audience laughing] “You understand that, though, right?” [audience laughing] “All right. All right, now.” “I had a wonderful time tonight.” [audience laughing] “I did. I’ll call you.” “All right.” [audience laughing] Them empty-nester b*tches? [groans] Come back from the bathroom, this b*tch like, “What we eating for breakfast?” [audience laughing] Now I gotta get dressed in a full suit and lie and say I got an interview to go to. [audience laughing] “What you doing with that suit on?” “I got this interview I gotta go to.” “It’s four in the morning!” “These are the only hours they got.” [audience laughing] “Wish me luck.” [audience laughing] Don’t act like I’m the only motherfucker that got dressed to kick a motherfucker out. You ever get in your car, drive around the block? [Deon laughs] [audience laughing] [Deon laughing] You wait to see which way they turn, and then you turn the other way? [audience laughing] Fellas, it’s a sex toy out there for the ladies that’s fucking us up. It’s called a rose. [woman cheers] The… [audience laughing] [women cheering] Testimonial hollers in here. [audience laughing] This motherfucker is shutting motherfuckers down, dude. This rose shit is serious. I was in the bed one day with one of my vintage pieces, and… [audience laughing] [scattered applause] You know, we masturbating, you know. I mean, young people, you gotta understand. Listen. When you get older, it ain’t about fucking and making somebody come. It’s like, n*ggas gotta get up in the morning. You know what I mean? You masturbate, she masturbate. We done, high five, and then we roll over and go to bed. [audience laughing] When you older, you responsible for your own comes and shit. [audience laughs] “It ain’t my job to make you come. That’s your come.” “That’s your come. That ain’t my come.” [audience laughing] [Deon laughs] [scattered cheering and applause] So we masturbating. [audience laughing] She reaches under the pillow and goes, “My niece gave me this thing.” “It’s called a rose.” [audience laughing] “Never seen it. I thought I’d bring it along.” “Maybe we can have a little fun with it. Is that okay?” I’m like this. “Yeah, yeah, that’s cool. Yeah.” “How you turn this thing on? I don’t know.” “She should have sent me instructions or something.” “Oh, there it is. There it is. I got it.” [audience laughing] “All right. Okay.” “We gon’ see, right? Okay, let’s see what this thing do.” [audience laughing] “Ah!” [audience laughing] I’m like, “You aight? You okay?” “Ahhh!” I saw this b*tch’s spirit leave her body, go to the ceiling, come back down in her body. She didn’t even cut it off. She just opened her hand, and it shook out her hand, down the bed and out the door. [audience laughing] I’m like, “What the fuck was that?!” [audience laughing] Her dizzy ass looking at me like, “Aight, come and get some pussy.” I’m like, “B*tch, you are done. No.” [audience laughing] Grandma Cole kissed her forehead and took her trash out. [audience laughing] That’s what I was over there doing, to take her trash out! [laughs] Them old b*tches’ll get you to take their trash out. “What you doing over there? Can you come and lift these bags for me?” [audience laughing] I got in trouble recently for calling women vintage and shit. I was on the NAACP Awards, and I called women vintage. Everybody went crazy, and I was like, “Why?” Like, I been saying that for years. I just don’t think they looked up the word, you know? ‘Cause it’s not a bad word. It was like, “No, we seasoned.” I’m like, “No, you’re not.” If I go buy a Corvette, I’m not gonna be like, “Let me get that seasoned Corvette.” I’mma be like, “Let me get that vintage motherfucker.” See, the word “vintage” means rare, one of a kind, stands the test of time, you know? [audience cheering] More valuable than any new model. Get it? Yeah, it’s vintage. That’s what it is. It ain’t like I called y’all antique b*tches. [audience laughing] We all getting old, goddamn it, and I ain’t running from it neither. I’m getting old, too, and shit. I don’t even like to call it “old.” I just say, “We expiring.” [audience laughing] Say that to yourself every morning. I bet you get some shit done. [audience laughing] Like, “Ooh, let me get this shit done before I expire and shit.” [audience laughing] I knew I was getting old. One day, I was brushing my hair and had to switch arms. [audience laughing] “Goddamn! What the fuck?” [audience laughing] I’m too old to be putting together outfits and shit and going over here to get the shirt, the pants, the shoes. Fuck that. Whatever’s on the mannequin. [audience laughing] That’s where I’m at with it. I go in there and be like, “Let me get this whole situation here.” [audience laughs] “Beach ball too. Let me get the beach ball with it.” [audience laughing] Then I go in the club, herding them hos, like… [audience laughing] You ever go somewhere and they got warm butter? Don’t you feel like they care about you? [audience laughs] In a restaurant, you be like, “This warm? Let me get to spreading it, n*gga.” [audience laughing] Unlike them other places. That little gold, hard hockey puck of butter. [audience laughing] Gonna tear your bread up trying to spread this shit. Bread all over your butter. [audience laughing] I ain’t got no time for that shit. Now I bite the butter and then the bread. [audience laughing] I hate to be called OG. This young n*gga seen me one day. He wanted a picture. “OG, can I get a picture?” I was like, “Just call me Deon.” He was like, “OG Deon, can I get your picture? [audience laughing] I take the picture with this n*gga. He standing there like this. [audience laughing] I’m right next to him like this. This what this little n*gga told me. “No, OG, put that down. Don’t do that.” [audience laughing] “You don’t put up peace signs in your pictures?” He was like, “Nah, we don’t do that no more, OG.” “What the fuck I’mma do with my peace fingers, then, n*gga?” [audience laughs] [audience laughing] [scattered applause] You can tell how old a woman is by the size of the fonts on her phone. [audience laughing] This girl’s like, “Can I get your number?” “Yeah.” She opened her phone. “D-E-O…” [audience laughing] I’m like, “A letter a page, b*tch?” Like… [audience laughing] We have any young women in the house? Clap, round of applause? [cheering and applause] That’s cool. [Deon laughing] I’m looking at the women in here who are like, “When you say young…” [audience laughing] “Mind, spirit? What we talking about, n*gga?” “What’s young, Deon?” If you gotta think about it, I ain’t talking to you. [audience laughing] Young girls got too much energy for me. You ever go dancing with a young chick? Motherfucker be out there… [grunts] [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] “Come here!” I be like, “Mm-mm.” [audience laughing] “Nah.” That’s too much energy for me. I like an old vintage b*tch. [audience laughing] I want a motherfucker that fell before. [audience laughing] They move like this. They be like… [audience laughing] “Go on, then, if you’re gonna rush. I ain’t about to hurry up and fall again.” [audience laughing] Young women that’s in here, do a lot of older men hit on you? [women] Yes. Yes? Here’s a very smooth way to get an older man off you. Real smooth, aight? Next time an older dude be like, “Hey, sweet thing. How you doing, baby?” all you gotta say is, “I’m okay, mister.” [audience laughing] Shut down that n*gga whole operation. [audience laughing] “Mister? The fuck?” [audience laughing] “Nah, baby, don’t do that to me. Nah, don’t do that to me.” “No, my name Gregory. Call me Gregory.” [audience laughing] “Okay, Mr. Gregory.” “B*tch. B*tch, is you stupid?” “Is you stupid, b*tch? Why would you…?” [audience laughing] All older men got fucked-up bladders. [audience laughing] All of ’em. There’s some in here tonight. [audience laughing] You can tell who they are ’cause they all got aisle seats. [audience laughing] Just look up and down the aisle. You’ll see these n*ggas. [audience laughing] Look at the n*ggas in the middle looking at the n*ggas with aisle seats. “Damn, I wish I got one of them aisle seats. “Can’t even drink my liquor the way I want to.” [audience laughing] All old dudes got fucked-up bladders. You can tell too. If you get in a man’s car and he got a whole bunch of empty 12oz Sprite bottles in there… [audience laughing] …that n*gga bladder fucked up. Think I’m bullshitting? Try to throw away one bottle. He’ll lose his rabbit-ass mind. “Hey, b*tch, I ain’t asked you to grab my bottles.” “I bought them bottles. They’re mine. Thank you, but no, thank you.” “I’ll throw ’em away when I’m… when I’m ready.” [audience laughing] I ain’t gonna lie. I got bottles, too, though. [audience laughs] Wide-mouth bottles. [audience laughing] Snapples, n*gga. [audience laughing] Gatorade, n*gga. [audience laughing] No, I’m bullshitting. I got those same Sprite bottles. [audience laughing] [Deon laughing] Everybody be trying to look young nowadays and shit. They be getting work done and shit and… Even if ain’t work, everybody wanna look youthful and shit. Creams and all kinds of shit, you know. But one thing they never take into consideration, they be doing all the surgery, all the creams, doing whatever they need, especially n*ggas with money. They get everything. But I still can tell how old you are. It’s one thing they never take into consideration, that I still can tell how old you are by who you hang with. The people you hang with are gonna dictate your age. Absolutely. So you can go get all that surgery and do everything that you doing, but if you still hanging out with these dusty-ass motherfuckers, then… [audience laughs] Yeah, yeah. And even if you ain’t doing surgery, if you doing whatever to look youthful, and, you know, I still can tell. I saw LL Cool J at this party, right? And I was like this. “Damn, L, you look good as shit, man. That’s good.” I looked, and I’m like, “Who are these wise men this n*gga hanging out with?” [audience laughing] Bunch of old n*ggas with staffs and shit. [audience laughing] “Get off my lawn!” [audience laughing] LL gonna fuck me up for that one. [audience laughing] Angela Bassett fine as a motherfucker. [cheering and applause] Whoo! My man Courtney pulled a good one with that one, boy. But her girls… [audience laughing] I seen her girls at this party. One had this sequin suit coat jacket on. The shoulder pads was all the way up here. Motherfucker couldn’t hear shit I was saying. “What?” [audience laughing] “What? What?” [audience laughing] “What?” [audience laughing] Her other girl had this shit going on. [laughter and surprised reactions] I came back with a glass of wine. I was like, “Mmm… nah.” [audience laughs] “You ain’t about to shake this shit all over my mannequin outfit.” [audience laughs] [shaking] One of the girls was fine as a motherfucker, though. Oh, she was so fucking pretty, sitting there looking all beautiful and shit, just fucking fine, just… She had, like, this salt-and-pepper asymmetrical hairstyle and shit, you know? Little waist, poised as hell, you know. Fat ass. You could tell it was big ’cause when she sat in the chair, it spread out and shit. [audience laughs] She was sitting there looking beautiful as fuck. Just chilling. Just sexy as fuck. But that get-up start-away walk… [audience laughing] That shit’ll tell on you every time. She got up to go to the bar. She was like… [groaning] [audience laughing] [laughter and applause] The start-away walk. Sometimes you can’t even walk away right away. You’ll get lightheaded. You just gotta stand there for a second, you know? [audience laughing] I like to compliment older women when I see them. Like, 80. Like, in their eighties. I compliment them and tell them how beautiful they are. I think everybody should do that shit, you know, tell ’em that… ‘Cause they lasted this long. You’re like, “Man, you beautiful as shit.” You gotta do that shit. [applause] I do. I give ’em love. Every woman I see is beautiful. I mean, that’s in her eighties and stuff. I tell her she beautiful, definitely. I’ll see one in the grocery store, like… [yells] “Hey!” [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] “You the sexiest b*tch in here right now.” [audience laughs] [audience laughing] I do it to women in wheelchairs. I give ’em love, tell ’em they beautiful. I be like, “You stand up here and kiss me, you sexy b*tch!” [audience laughs] [audience laughing] I met one in a grocery store, old woman. This the oldest I ever fucked around with somebody. Sixty-eight. Bad! Shut down any 55-year-old. [audience laughing] Bad bad. Met her in the grocery store. She had her hair pulled back in a ponytail. It was all white. You could tell she just did it in the car too. She pulled it back. It was all frizzy and shit. She had them glasses that connect over her nose. You ever see them? [audience laughing] Had the whole store smelling like White Diamonds. [audience laughing] That Elizabeth Taylor shit go hard, yo. [audience laughs] One spray last you a week. [audience laughing] Big-ass titties. She had some big tit… She had titties so big, I couldn’t tell how big her stomach was, you know? You ever see them, them titties like that? I like them kind of titties. Big titties. ‘Cause when I’m lying on my back, she on top of me and let ’em go, they just drop in my face. [audience laughs] Like oxygen masks on planes. [audience laughing] Better than them little-titty b*tches where you gotta do a set of 30 crunches to reach the motherfuckers. [audience laughing] “Burn!” [audience laughing] “Just bring ’em down. Can you bring ’em down here, please?” [audience laughing] We started going out, hanging out. I gave her my number. We started talking, then we start doing what we do, and, yeah, it started going good and shit. Then she started calling me her lover. That some grown shit. I ain’t had nobody ever call me some shit like that. I was like, “That shit get my dick hard.” She be calling me up. “Hey, lover.” I be like, “Oh…” [laughs coyly] [audience laughing] “Aight. What you want from Walgreens?” [audience laughing] She know how to get some Walgreens out of a n*gga. [audience laughing] That day, I gave her an extended shoehorn. [audience laughing] Slide right into her kitten heels, easy. [audience laughing] She always going up there getting her pantyhose and shit. So weird. Her pantyhose come in an egg. [audience laughing] That b*tch cracked that shit on my head one day. Like… [crack] I was like… [audience laughing] [woman screams] [audience laughing] I see someone likes L’eggs in here. [audience laughing] She liked me to spoon her to sleep at night. That’s her shit. Like, late at night. Get over there about six. [audience laughing] I know. She still be up. That’s wild. Like, “You better go to bed, girl.” [audience laughing] I blow on her hair until she go to sleep. When she wake up in the morning, I make her coffee. Folgers. [audience laughing] That’s the official old-b*tch coffee, Folgers. [audience laughing] ‘Cause there’s too many chemicals in Starbucks. Best part of waking up is a old b*tch with a cup. [audience laughing] [man roaring with laughter] [audience laughing] See you done made a few hos some Folgers too, huh, n*gga? I fucks with you, n*gga. [audience laughing] And we don’t worry about her getting pregnant. [audience laughing] Mm-mm. Them days are long past us. I asked her one day, “Are you on the pill?” She was like, “If you don’t open that window and shut the fuck up…” [audience laughing] Yeah, we don’t worry about that shit. I be shooting that old box up. [audience laughing] You can hear my shit ricocheting in there. [audience laughing] “Bing, bing, boom, bang, beam, bow, boom, pow.” [audience laughing] I fuck with grown women, you hear me? Grown, goddamn it. [cheering and applause] The women I fuck with, before we fuck, we pee first. [audience laughing] Kissing. “Mmm… muah!” “I’ll be right back.” [audience laughing] I don’t know what’s wrong with my come. That shit ain’t coming out like it used to. It ain’t. Sometimes it don’t come out at all. It be weird, man. I don’t know what the fuck going on. I think it’s these vitamins I’ve been taking or something. My little vintage piece was giving me head one day. I came. Just a gust of wind shot down her throat. Her little flimsy throat can’t handle some shit like that. That shit was like… [whoosh] She was like, “Ha-ha-hee!” [audience laughing] [wheezing] [audience laughing] “Was that wind that came out your dick just now?” I was like, “Yeah. I gotta go see a doctor.” “I think it’s these vitamins I’ve been taking.” “I don’t know what the fuck is going on.” And I don’t like professional head. If you give good head, I don’t… I don’t want that shit. That shit turn me off. Like, professional head? Mm-mm. I like novice head. [audience laughs] Yeah. If you know what you doing, act like you don’t know what you doing when giving me head. Look at me like this. “Is this okay? Hmm?” [audience laughing] “Yes.” [audience laughing] I don’t like good professional head, man. Motherfucker who suck your dick all good? Nah, ’cause anybody who give good head or somebody give me good head, the whole time, I can’t help but to think all the practice you done had… [audience laughing] …to reach these levels of greatness. [audience laughing] Mm-mm. This girl came in my bedroom one day butt-ass naked, just a scrunchie on, like… I was like, “Hold on. Let’s talk about this.” [audience laughing] “Ahh! Bop, bop, bop!” I’m like, “No!” “Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop!” You ever have a b*tch brush her teeth with your dick, n*gga? That b*tch like… [audience laughing] I’m like, “No!” [audience laughing] I don’t want that shit. You give me some good novice head, in return, I give you one hell of a ponytail. [audience laughs] While you down there giving me head, I just… [audience laughing] Girl get up like, “Goddamn, n*gga! Shit!” [audience laughing] “How you get a bang right here, n*gga? That’s crazy.” [audience laughing] When you giving head, ladies, make sure you know what kind of penis you working with, aight? Okay? And… and… and that dictates the kind of head you give, you know. Some of y’all got this guy. “Mmm.” And some of you got this guy. “Hmm.” “Mmm.” “Hmm.” Fellas, don’t sleep on no two fingers. I had a motherfucker hit me off good with them motherfuckers, boy. That b*tch was hitting a trumpet, n*gga. Like… [singing upbeat melody] I had a umbrella second-lining on that motherfucker. [audience laughing] “Mmm.” “Hmm.” Some of y’all got this n*gga, though. Mmm, that old two-hand n*gga. [grunting] Yeah, I ain’t no two-hand n*gga. [audience laughing] This girl did that to me one time. I was like, “Aw, that’s so sweet, but you can take that top hand off.” [audience laughing] “No, for real. There ain’t nothing there to suck.” “Just take that off and we good. Just…” [audience laughing] “B*tch, you giving me an Indian burn. Stop, please.” [audience laughing] I got some jokes I’m gonna try for y’all. [cheering and applause] Hopefully, you like ’em. If not, I’ll never see you again, so it don’t matter. [audience laughs] [clears throat] You know who gotta change they name real soon? Babyface. [audience laughing] Saw him perform recently, and I was looking at him the whole time going, “You got one more week of Babyface.” [audience laughing] Not that I don’t call you the Face, n*gga. [audience laughing] [scattered applause] If you’re giving somebody head, whether it be male or female, and they tap you on your forehead, or they pull you up and go, “Come on,” don’t try to fuck. Just grab your coat and leave. [audience laughing] ‘Cause you was horrible. [audience laughing] You get that pull-up, go ahead and leave. Just grab your keys and go. [audience laughing] I had one of my vintage honeys do that to me one time, but she ain’t let me go. She kept me there and consulted me and shit. [audience laughing] She was like, “Mm-mm. Baby, mm-mm. No, come on. Come on.” “Come, come, come, come, come.” [audience laughing] “No, don’t go nowhere. Just lay right here. It’s all good.” “That’s all right. No, just lay right here. It’s fine.” “It’s fine, baby.” “If you knew better, you’d do better, right?” [audience laughing] “We ain’t got nothing but time and opportunity.” “It’s gonna work out. We’re gonna work it out, I promise you.” [audience laughing] Fellas, if you 50, close to 50, or over 50, and you got a girlfriend, fiancée, or wife, and you still working out, you got some extra young hos on the side. [laughter and surprised reactions] Guaranteed. ‘Cause what you still working out for, huh? It’s over. [audience laughing] What, you got a big fight coming up, n*gga? What is you… [audience laughing] Fellas, you ever catch your girl humping in her sleep? I don’t play that shit. [audience laughing] You humping in your sleep, I’d be like, “B*tch, who’s you fucking?” [audience laughing] Especially if she ain’t give you no pussy before she knocked out asleep, like… [audience laughing] “Get that n*gga off of you in your dreams, b*tch!” [audience laughing] When Christian people have sex, what kind of music do they listen to? [audience laughing] They can’t listen to worldly music. See, it’s a void. That’s why I’mma start making gospel love songs. Start making something they can fuck to. [audience laughing] ♪ Put down your Bible ♪ [audience laughing] ♪ And I’mma take off my usher gloves ♪ [audience laughing] Do big girls wear waist beads? [audience laughing] Oh, okay. All right. [audience laughing] “Yes! And?! And?!” [audience laughing] Who here with they best friend? Clap. [cheering and applause] I don’t know if you ever realized this, but you all can’t go to each other’s funerals. [surprised reactions] [audience laughing] That took a wrong turn, didn’t it? [audience laughing] Why y’all get so sensitive? What I’m saying to you is that you got to hang out with the person that you with. Hang out ’cause you can’t go to each other’s funeral. So you gotta love that person and be with them. That’s all that I was trying to say and shit, you know. [applause] Plus, listen, I am a observational comic. That’s what they call me, a observational comic. I observe things, and I talk about it. I’m not one of these slip-on-banana-peel, pie-in-the-face-ass fucking comedians and shit, you know? If you noticed, I barely moved all night. [audience laughing] I’m a observational motherfucker and shit. So that’s all I was doing. Observing something that you probably haven’t thought about, you know? My man Ocean said that shit to me one day, drunk as shit. He was like, “Hey, n*gga, you know we can’t go to each other’s funerals.” I was like, “N*gga, that’s deep.” [audience laughing] “Well, I’m going to yours.” [audience laughing] Why the older you get, the more violent your come sounds become? [audience laughing] When you old and you come, you be like… “Ahhh!” “Ahh!” [audience laughing] “Ohh!” “Ahhh!” “Ah!” “Ahh!” [groaning] [crackly inhale] [audience laughing] “Ooh, that was good, baby. Goddamn!” [audience laughing] When gay people say su… eh. [audience laughing] Nah, I ain’t doing that, motherfucker. [audience laughs] N*ggas cancel me and fuck up my Old Spice contract. [laughter and applause] [cheering and applause] Jamaican men some dirty-dick motherfuckers, boy. [audience laughing] They fuck anything. They don’t care. Homeless women. They don’t give a fuck [audience laughs] “What is a beautiful girl like you living in a box like this for?” [audience laughing] “Leave that b*tch alone. She homeless, n*gga.” [audience laughing] I was in the waiting room at the doctor’s office, sitting there waiting. Jamaican nurse comes out the back, and she goes, “The Uncle.” “The Uncle.” And I’m going, “Who would write their name down ‘The Uncle’?” “That’s some stupid shit.” But the b*tch was really saying, “Deon Cole.” [audience laughing] “The Uncle.” [audience laughing] “Deon Cole.” [audience laughing] Fuck around and missed my appointment over that bullshit. [audience laughing] I hate the way these young people text nowadays. All that abbreviation and shit. I don’t be understanding that shit. Little young dude that work for me. [clears throat] He texted me this. This is what he texted me. He texted me the letter D, comma, the letter R, the letter U, the letter O, O, T. And I was like, “What the fuck?” [audience laughs] I called him up. “What’s that?” He was like, “Oh, I was just saying, ‘D, are you out of town?'” [audience laughing] N*gga, how the fuck I’m supposed to know these letters mean that? “Everybody know that.” “No, n*gga, everybody don’t.” [audience laughing] Click. [audience laughs] Fifteen minutes later, I text him this. This is what I text him. Y, I, A, B, I, M, B, B, E, D, O, H, F, L, I, T, M. [audience laughing] [scattered applause] He called me. “Hey, what the fuck is that?” [audience laughs] “I was just saying, yes, I am, but I might be back early depending on how flights look in the morning.” [laughter and applause] “Everybody know that, n*gga.” [laughter and applause] [audience cheering] [cheering and applause] Oh boy. Learn how to date, everybody. All right? Learn how to date. And ask some good questions. Y’all keep asking these surface questions. Ask good questions. One question a lot of men don’t ask women which you should ask… I ask this all the time. It’s a make-or-break question for me. Anytime you meet a woman, fellas, you gotta ask her, “What temperature are you?” Yeah. You gotta ask that. You don’t want to be spending time with her, y’all start liking each other, hanging out and stuff, then you start going over her house, and you find out her house 90 motherfucking degrees. [audience laughing] “Is she anemic?” [audience laughing] Now you fucking on bath tiles. [audience laughing] You should ask, “What temperature is you?” I’ll go over some vintage woman house, and her shit 50 motherfucking degrees. You can hang meat in this motherfucker. [audience laughs] Neck-fan batteries all over the goddamn place. Keep cutting… The air on, heat on, air on, heat on, air… You’ll catch pneumonia over this b*tch house. [audience laughs] “Yeah, so what temperature is you?” See, I like a nice 71-to-73-degree motherfucker. Sometimes 74, depending on what we’re doing, you know. Yeah, that temperature’s a motherfucker. Even in the workplace, you know? Like, a lot of jobs, offices, they can’t get 100% out of Black women because it’s too cold in that motherfucker. [laughter and applause] For real. Y’all gotta cut that goddamn air off, and then you can get 100% out of the Black women that work there. Every Black woman I know, at her job, got a shawl and a space heater at that motherfucker. [laughter and applause] Try to get these n*ggas 100%. I’m quite sure Kamala got a space heater at the White House. [audience laughing] And everybody wanna be a boyfriend and girlfriend, but don’t nobody wanna be a best friend. That’s what the fuck you should be focusing on. [cheering and applause] Quit doing the shit you been doing. No relationship shit and trying to… Fuck that shit. Find you a motherfucker that’s cool as shit and then get off into that shit, because if the fucking don’t work out, you still got a friend. You can’t keep wasting your life away on these relationships. They’re motherfuckers you don’t even speak to no more. [applause] There’s motherfuckers you don’t even speak to no more, and you done gave this n*gga your good years. This n*gga done took all your good years. I can see it in your eyes. [audience laughing] I see you thinking about that n*gga. The ol’ bastard. That bastard, he took ’em all, didn’t he? Yeah, n*gga got you all fat. Fat and fun. Y’all was eating and drinking the whole time. Then he left you, and you like, “Where you going? Oh no!” “You suggested that food. I didn’t wanna eat that shit.” [audience laughing] “Bye, b*tch!” [audience laughing] Hanging out… That’s what I’m waiting on. I’m waiting on a friend. I want a motherfucking friend and shit that can come to… Anything I can do with my n*ggas, I wanna do with her. Movies, concerts. Fucking listen to music, all that shit. I’mma do all that. And look. I’m the type of motherfucker, I wanna be who I am. One thing I’m not gonna stop, I’m never gonna stop looking at women. I think women are beautiful, and whoever with me, you got to know I’mma look at ’em. Now, I ain’t gonna be disrespectful and groping and trying to holler, but I just… I like the beauty of women and shit, and I’mma be looking at ’em. I want a motherfucker that’s gonna look at b*tches with me. That’s the motherfucker I’m waiting on. [scattered applause] That’s what I want. If I see a bad motherfucker, I’ll be like, “That’s a bad b*tch.” I want her to be like, “Yeah, that b*tch bad as a motherfucker.” And I’m so confident in my sexuality to return the fucking favor. I am. If you see some sexy-ass n*gga, and you like, “That n*gga sexy as hell,” I’ll be like, “Yeah, he got b*tches.” [laughter and applause] That’s how men compliment men when you think a n*gga fine. [audience laughing] Like, “My n*gga Tone? That n*gga got hos, n*gga.” [laughter and applause] [Deon chuckles] “Tone got hos.” Don’t act like… Fellas, don’t act like you don’t know a fine n*gga when you see one. Don’t bullshit. Don’t try to be hard like that. You know when a dude look nice or not. You’ll be around a motherfucker so fine, you vanish. [audience laughing] I have. [audience laughs] I did a movie with Idris Elba, and… [audience cheering] Hos was literally trying to walk through me. [audience laughing] I had to thump ’em in the forehead. Like, “B*tch, you see me standing here. What the fuck?” [laughter and applause] Ladies, do me a favor too. I want you to do me a favor, like, when it come to your man, all right? I’mma speak for all men in here tonight. I’mma be the spokesman for all the fellas in here. Ladies, the one thing that men want that’d make us happy and be with you forever is you must rub our dicks all the time. [scattered laughter and applause] [scattered cheering] You hear these testimonial claps? [audience laughing] That’s all we want. Rub our dick any chance you get. If you with him tonight, put your purse on his lap and rub his dick. Go ahead. You should’ve been doing it the whole show. Shame on you, b*tch. [audience laughing] You rub that man dick anytime you get it. And stop fucking with our nipples. [audience laughing] Our nipples don’t have the same sensation as yours. Any n*gga that be like, “Ooh, yeah, go ahead,” that n*gga’s a weirdo. Kick him out your house. [laughter and applause] “Ooh yeah! Oh! Don’t forget this one! Don’t forget… Don’t forget this one.” Get that weird old n*gga out your house. You rub our dicks. [audience laughing] And if you ain’t gonna rub it, stay the fuck away from me. [audience laughs] Fellas, you ever be on your couch at home, watching the game, chilling, and here she come, plopping on your lap? You be like… [audience laughing] That b*tch feel that shit. [audience laughing] You rub that man dick. [audience laughs] Any time you’re in public, you rub his dick. If y’all at the grocery store, grocery shopping and shit, rub his dick. That shit’d get you out of cooking. [audience laughing] All you gotta do is get real close up on him. That’s how you do it in public. Get real close on him like this and be like, “So, uh, what we eating tonight?” [audience laughing] N*gga be like, “Uh, we can get some gummy bears.” [audience laughing] “Some cereal. We don’t need no milk. Just cereal. I’m cool with cereal.” Tonight, that man driving you home, focused on the road, making sure you get home safely. And you sitting in the passenger seat on your phone with two good hands? [audience laughing] You disrespectful b*tch, you. [audience laughing] You reach over there and rub that man dick till y’all get home. [audience laughs] You still got your phone in this other hand, motherfucker. You don’t need two hands to scroll. I ain’t never seen a n*gga scrolling like… [audience laughing] You rub that man dick. [audience laughing] Anytime you in that passenger seat, morning, noon, and night, you rub that man’s dick. You hear me? It’s the little things. That n*gga’ll love you forever if you did that shit. You rub his dick good enough, ain’t no telling where that n*gga gonna drive to. [audience laughing] “Let me see if there’s a Zales open around here.” “Get this b*tch some earrings or something, shit! Faithfully rubbing this motherfucker. “I like it. I like it.” [audience laughing] And if you feeling real froggy tonight, ladies, do me a favor. Go ahead and put your head over there and hit ’em off and shit tonight. Yeah! Be brave. Put your head under that steering wheel. Go ahead. Make him adjust that steering wheel. That n*gga had that shit all the way up here tonight. [audience laughing] Los Angeles, I love you. [audience cheering] I hope you had a good time tonight. Thank you so much. Love y’all from the bottom of my heart. Anybody that ever bought a ticket, anybody that ever supported me, that ever come out to the show, I love you forever. Los Angeles, thank you. I’m Deon Cole.

              " 'asir': [\"Ahir Shah: Ends (2024)\\nGenre: Stand-up Comedy, Social Commentary\\nDirector: Peter Orton\\nWriter: Ahir Shah\\nStar: Ahir Shah In this stand-up comedy special, Ahir Shah takes the audience on a personal and cultural journey, reflecting on his British Indian heritage and family history. From childhood memories of watching Goodness Gracious Me with his grandparents to dealing with societal changes, class, and multiculturalism in the UK, Shah blends humor and poignant storytelling. The show covers themes of identity, family sacrifice, love, and the generational impact of immigration, all while maintaining his trademark wit and insightful social commentary. * * * [man] In January 1998, a seven-year-old boy was sat on the floor of his grandparents’ living room in Alperton, North West London. Three generations gathered round the telly to watch episode one of this new show on the BBC. Now, the boy’s grandparents had had tough lives, right? The sort of lives that clad you in an armour, and it’s the sort of armour from which laughter struggles to escape. But for the next half hour, the boy and his family watched episode one of Goodness Gracious Me, and he listened as his grandparents fucking pissed themselves laughing at themselves and with themselves for the first time he could remember. And watching Sanjeev Bhaskar, Meera Syal, Nina Wadia and Kulvinder Ghir on television, the boy thought, “Wait, we can do that?! I didn’t know we could do that.” “But if we get to do that, then I wanna do that,” because hearing my grandparents make that sound is the best sound I’ve ever heard in my entire life. Over 25 years later, would you please welcome to the stage Mr Ahir Shah. Hello! Hello! Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Good evening, London. Are we well? [cheering and applause] Fantastic, fantastic. Lovely to have you here. Lovely to have you in such fine voice. Hello! Uh, my name is Ahir Shah. That is my name, by the way, right? I didn’t used to need to clarify this, until a few years ago, I was doing this gig in Switzerland… I was doing a gig in Switzerland, and the theme of this gig was that every comedian was from a different country, right? I was the British entrant. Very modern. Right? And… [laughter] There was one comedian I was particularly excited to meet ’cause this guy’s name was Ali Al Sayed. Now, Ali is a stand-up comedian from the United Arab Emirates, of all places, right? I’d never met anyone from the United Arab Emirates, let alone a comedian from the United Arab Emirates. To be perfectly honest, I didn’t think they had comedians in the United Arab Emirates. I assumed he’d just be walking onstage being like, “What’s the deal with unspeakable oil wealth?” [laughter] He’s a very nice man, a very funny man. After the show, all the comedians, we’re all backstage hanging out. We’re all having a laugh, having a drink. Not Ali, obviously. Right, and… We get to talking, and he says to me, “Like, uh, listen, bro.” “We’re friends now. I can ask you a question.” “You’re not gonna get offended.” I’m like, “Listen, brother.” “You’re from Dubai. I’m of South Asian origin.” “As long as the question you have for me is not, ‘Do you want a job on a construction site?'” [laughter] Industrialised slavery. “You can ask me whatever the hell you like.” He’s like, “Nothing like that. I was just wondering.” “When did you decide to start using the hilarious comedy stage name Ahir Shah?” Right? I was like, “To be honest, I don’t remember, but it was probably 28th December 1990 when I plopped out of Mrs Shah, and she and Mr Shah decided to call their newborn bundle of joy Ahir.” “I think that’s about when I started going by Ahir Shah.” He’s like, “Right, right, okay.” “One thing you should know, in case you’re ever in my neck of the woods, is that in Arabic, your name means Prostitute King!” He wasn’t even fucking with me. Ahir Shah is “prostitute king” in Arabic. There are several reasons I didn’t think my career would go stratospheric in Saudi. Humble enough to know that I don’t have the best bone-saw material on the circuit. That’s Romesh, and fair enough. Right, but, uh… I put this to the back of my mind for several years, as you would, until, uh, November 2022. I was in Egypt doing some work around the COP climate conference. They speak Arabic in Egypt, and I don’t know if anyone else in the room has ever walked into a hotel and attempted to check in by announcing themselves to everyone working there as “Monarch of all Pimps”? Really changes the vibe in a lobby, in my experience. They think you’re selling something very different to what you are. Anyway, that’s me, then. Ahir Shah. Prostitute King to my friends. Mr Shah to you, and, uh… It’s been a while since I’ve done a big show like this. A lot’s changed in the world, in my life. A lot’s changed in my life. I’m now very much in my thirties now. That’s exciting. Shit started falling apart way younger than I was led to believe, by the way. I thought I had another good decade left in me. As it stands, everything’s already just crumbling. My knees are already fucked. Absolutely no idea what’s going on there. I’m trying desperately to get a referral from my GP, right… Sorry, for younger people… Right, um, a GP… Right… So a GP was a service where, like… Young fellow. How old are you, mate? Twenty-two. Twenty-two. So you might remember but in the same way you remember iPods. You never had one, but you’re vaguely aware they existed. Okay, so basically, like, a GP was this, like… Right, imagine you’re a bit poorly. Not super poorly but a bit poorly. What would happen was there was this number you called, and someone answered, right, and, uh… Not even necessarily at eight in the morning. Any time during business hours. Very forthcoming. Uh, so you’d call them, and you’d be like, “Oh, I’m a bit poorly,” and they’d be like, “Ah, cool. Come see us, soon.” Right? And so a couple of days, days, a couple of days later, what would happen was you went over to this… Right. It looked like a semi-detached house. It wasn’t. That was the first trick they played. It’s like a sphinx’s riddle. Past that, you were golden. You’d arrive, like, 10, 15 minutes early. You’re a conscientious person. And you’d sit in a sort of, uh, waiting room, and after about 10, 15 minutes, someone would call your name, and you’d go to a separate, smaller room, and there would just be one guy in there, and he would be like… I mean, he would, right? ‘Cause we’ve quite a reassuring manner in a lanyard. Right? And you’d tell this person what sort of poorly that you were, and this was a very well-educated person, so you could just be fixed then and there, but occasionally, it’d be a slightly more complex health need, and you’d get a referral to a hospital, right? Sorry. Right. A hospital. Now… Have you ever wondered where the queue of ambulances ends? Right? That is a building known as a “hospital”. Funny word, isn’t it? Interesting thing. You were born in one. You’ll die in one. Between then, you’re fucked. Sorry. Right, uh, basically that… I’m obviously being slightly disingenuous. There are quite a lot of them. Generally speaking, they were all either built or done up when the prime minister’s name was either Attlee, Wilson, or Blair. Not sure why. Not sure why! It’s just a coincidence, isn’t it? What possible intellectual merit could there be in examining why that might have ended up being the case of all things? Fourteen fucking years! Fourteen wasted fucking years! Like, not entirely wasted, obviously. There have been some genuine achievements of Conservative government. I mean that entirely sincerely, by the way. My favourite of which is, like… Basically, it’s funny. If you ignore all of the noise and just look at the actual underlying data, over the last 14 years, the Tories so successfully decarbonised the British economy and energy mix, including all imported emissions, that if the countries responsible for the lion’s share of emissions had been anything like as impressive as we’ve been over the last 14 years, global warming basically wouldn’t be a thing. The Tories did that. They did it on purpose. It is spectacularly impressive, and they can’t admit it ’cause they think it sounds gay. Other than that, it’s slim pickings out there. Really is. Genuinely. It’s worse than it’s been my entire adult life, for sure. Listen, the vibes are awful out there. We’re genuinely skint, as a collective, in a way that we weren’t in 2010 ’cause, basically, in 2010, the Conservatives were elected by telling a sequence of lies about the British economy and society. That they then spent the next 14 years ensuring were true. Right, and… Is it… We need an election, yeah. We need an election. At this stage, I would settle for a total overthrow of the current system and the installation of one-man dictatorial rule, provided that the man in question was Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, right? [whooping and applause] I love that guy! I love Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, so goddamn much. Do you sign up to his email? Oh yeah. You do? You’re a good citizen. Well done, sir. If you do not sign up for it, do your bit for your country. That man is the only thing standing between us and the fucking brink. Right. I love Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, so goddamn… So, for the uninitiated, Martin Lewis, he’s a money-saving expert, and he runs this website called MoneySavingExpert.com, and you get a weekly email, and it’s about money saving and the expertise therein, right? And, um, basically, Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, he set up his business for £80, right? Eight-zero. That’s all it cost. He is now worth 100 million, right? Isn’t that amazing? He gives a lot away to things like Citizen’s Advice ’cause he gives a shit unlike the people in charge. I love that for Martin Lewis. I love that Martin Lewis is rich. Right? Here’s the thing, right? The reason I love it is that Martin Lewis is basically the only person I can think of who’s got properly rich from helping. Do you know what I mean? Take a second to dwell on how rare that is, broadly speaking. ‘Cause there’s no money in helping, is there? We all know that. There’s money in hindering, for sure. Right? There’s no money in helping. Right? When’s the last time any of you were walking down the street and went, “Oh my god, a Lamborghini! Who does that belong to?” And someone’s like, “The lollipop lady.” Right? It doesn’t happen. ‘Cause there’s no money in helping unless you’re Martin Lewis. Because that man is rich as balls, and the way he got there was by getting all of us together and just being like, “Pizza Express. 2 for 1 on Wednesday.” “Dough balls are on me. Don’t worry about it.” It’s gonna take more than Martin Lewis to save us now, the state that we’re in. It’s really bad out there. And it’s weird for me because at the same time as the country I love is so visibly on its knees, I am personally happier than I have ever been in my entire life. And the two things are entirely unconnected, but still, feeling personally happy when your country is suffering feels actively distasteful. Do you know what I mean? I’ve not done it on purpose, but it’s like having Chumbawamba stuck in your head at a funeral. The reason, ladies and gentlemen, that I am happier than I have ever been is that in October of last year, I got married. Yeah. Honestly, she’s the single best thing ever to happen to me. I love her with all my heart. She’s a civil servant. I’m in it for the pension. You have to understand I’m a self-employed man. Before I met her, my retirement plan was just to not live that long. Whereas now, my entire financial security and old age is wholly dependent on not upsetting one woman till the day I die. Right? That’ll be a new personal best, mate. In this economy, I’ll try anything, right? I’d always known that I wanted to get married eventually. I guess there was a certain degree of cultural expectation as well. I don’t know what to tell you. In Asian families, you get married, you stay married. It’s just what happens. Some of you may know this from your own families, maybe friends’ families. You might not be aware of the sheer extent to which this is the case, so I’ll give you the best example I have. I started doing stand-up comedy when I was a teenager, right? When I was about 17 years old, I was given the opportunity to do five minutes at the Hackney Empire theatre in East London. That’s a very big theatre. 1500 people. Some of you may well have been. It’s the coolest thing that had ever happened to me. I was on in the first section, so I invited my mum, my dad and my sister to come watch, and they saved me a seat so I could watch in the second section. And the reason I was invited in the first place is that the Hackney Empire were putting on an evening of British Asian stand-up, and I, as the new kid on the block, they were like, “Let’s give little Ahir a go.” That’s nice, isn’t it? And so the whole audience, sold-out show, 1500 people, all British Asian. All of the performers, British Asian, apart from… right… about two hours before the show started, one of the acts suddenly had to drop out. Now, this is the noughties. It’s not like nowadays where everyone’s got email on their phones. They had to ring around, try and find a replacement. A replacement was found in the form of my friend the comedian Joe Bor. Right? Now, Joe is a very nice man. He’s a very funny man. What Joe is not is a British Asian man. Right? What Joe is is a Jewish man. Clearly, with two hours on the clock, one of the organisers was like, “Fuck! I…” [muttering] “I think Jews are basically Asian. I…” Listen, I’m not saying there aren’t similarities between the communities. My best mate’s Jewish. We’ve been mates since we were 14 years old, and it’s ’cause the first time we met, he told me about his mum, and everything that his mum did was either shit that my mum did or hadn’t thought of yet. There’s one crucial difference between the communities, as my friend the comedian Joe Bor found out to his dismay that evening. Because my friend the comedian Joe Bor walked onstage in front of 1500 brown faces and opened with the line, “My parents are divorced.” “Gimme a cheer if your parents are divorced.” Fucking nothing! Not a single sound from 1,500 people. I will never forget my mother leaning over and whispering in my 17-year-old ear, “Bless him. He has no idea who he’s talking to.” So what happens in Asian families, for better or for worse, you get married, you stay married. I come from a very long line of very long-married people. Uh, my parents met at a mutual friend’s birthday party in India in 1979. Fell in love at first sight. My dad proposed that night. They have been married for almost 45 years. Right? Um… By the standards of my mum’s family, by the way, my parents had had quite an extensive courtship, uh, prior to that. I mean, like, well, her parents, my maternal grandparents, Nanaji and Nanima, I mean, the first conversation they had with one another, just, like, one-on-one, was on the night, like, several hours after they were already married, right? It’s 1955 in India. It was arranged. I don’t know what to tell you. Like, they weren’t complete strangers to one another. That would be silly. It’s, like, the families had exchanged a photograph. Uh… Right? And, um… these pieces of paper with a few bits of biographical information on them. Imagine getting shown that when you’re, like, 19, 20. “Is this who you’d like to marry forever?” “Oh yeah, I guess.” Then, in the end, very happily married for nearly a half century until my grandfather sadly died relatively young. It’s so funny talking about this in front of liberal London audiences. Like, it’s just like, you all know that outwardly you have to be like, “Oh.” “The mysteries of the East.” Uh… “A rich cultural tapestry that may be interwoven with our own.” Internally, you’re all just thinking, “That’s fucking barbaric.” “The thing is, that’s fucking barbaric, sorry.” “You mean to tell me that two people barely out of their teens, and all they had to go on was a photograph and a few bits of scant biographical information, and within a matter of days, they were in bed together?” “That is fucking disgusting.” “We would never do anything so crass and horrific in our contemporary, enlightened Western…” [laughter and applause] Sorry, just because you’ve decided to do it via algorithm, not “old woman in your village”, does not make it less arranged, right? All you’ve decided to do is outsource responsibility to the one thing somehow less accountable, all right? My wife and I obviously had a far more conventional relationship, uh, prior to getting engaged, meeting in this country and whatnot. It took me a long time to work up the courage to pop the question, as they say, mate. We were going out five weeks, and I asked her to marry me. Um… I get shit done. There’s no point pissing about if you know you know. So just get it… get it done. No point leaving stuff on your to-do list for six months. Things are worth doing quickly and well. It’s the single best decision I ever made. Absolutely no downside. Admittedly, we were engaged for six months before we could start living together just because, like, our tenancy agreements didn’t… Spent half my life on a fucking bus. Then, eventually, obviously, we were able to finally move in together, but all that meant was we were two people in our early thirties living in London joining households, so now, we rent one roof that contains two copies of every Ottolenghi book and no realistic pathway to homeownership. [chuckles] I love my Ottolenghi books though. Not giving those up, even for a house. Might need the spares. Love my Ottolenghi books. Hey, mate, you got an Ottolenghi book? Ah yeah, I love it. Yeah? That’s the sort of thing you can afford when you get the Martin Lewis email. Love my Ottolenghi books. “For this recipe, you will need two limes that were once briefly glimpsed by a Persian widow.” “Or, if they don’t have that in a shop near you, just any lime.” The thing is, you think it’s bullshit, but I got some of the widow limes, and you can taste the grief. It’s good stuff, actually. The salt from the tears adds real depth of flavour. I think that, shy of having children with someone, I think getting engaged, getting married, it’s like the most optimistic bet that two people can make on the future. Just this idea that you can sincerely look at someone and say, “Our lives could be joined in something greater than the sum of its parts stretching forward for the rest of them.” That’s an extraordinarily optimistic way to feel, right? At the same time as it feels like we’re embarking on the most optimistic journey of a lifetime, it feels like the country around us has just given up. You know what I mean? It’s very difficult not to feel like this entire place has called last orders, isn’t it? It is acutely difficult not to feel deeply pessimistic about every element of the future of this country. Right? That’s weird enough for me as we’re beginning this optimistic journey, but it’s doubly weird when I think about the fact that if I were able to get into a time machine and travel to 1964, when my grandfather, younger than I am now, became the first member of our family to set foot on these shores, and I would just explain the present to him, he would not believe me because he would think I was describing some unimaginable utopia of progress. So that’s really what I’m trying to do. To take a step back, view things through a wider lens, a generational lens, get some perspective, not be so blinkered, try not to lose the wood for the trees. ‘Cause the story of my family is a very typical one for the British Indian community. I think that’s a very relevant story to the past, present and future of this country, right? British Indians are, by a very long margin, the largest minority-ethnic group in this country. Hindus, again we’re talking about millions upon millions… None of you know any of that because our entire cultural output consists of my mate Nish. Right? And… The story of the Indian community in this country, by and large, starts, as it did for my family, in the 1960s and has ended up, in the 2020s, with us now running everything? “Rishi bhai did it!” “Rishi bhai did it! Never thought I’d live to see the day that Rishi bhai did it.” “Got that big house in the middle of town now, baby.” “Rishi bhai did it!” Listen, politically, I’m furious. Racially, thrilled. Ah! Are you kidding me? On an ethnic level, couldn’t be happier for him and his family. Increasingly worried about mine. Very much how I used to feel every time I saw Suella Aunty on the television. “Jesus Christ, calm down, Suella Aunty. You’re gonna get us both killed.” Right, uh… I’m gonna talk about the prime minister a little bit. Obviously, I’ve got to be relatively careful what I say about him because we can all agree there’s about a 70% chance that a decade from now, I will play him in a Channel 4 drama. Right, right… Not gonna burn a bridge before I’ve even crossed it. Are you kidding me? I need that money. I just wish that I could get across, like, how wild that day was, right? I… A British Indian, devout Hindu, son of immigrants, became prime minister of Britain on Diwali. That was a very difficult day in the family WhatsApp for me. Get the family WhatsApp up on my phone. Yes, it’s called the Asian Network. See “Dad is typing…” Wait for the inevitable. “Ahir, have you seen what Mr Sunak’s son has done today?” “Still, Ahir, you enjoy mocking your week. I’m sure that’s nice for you.” I’m glad the shine’s come off him now. Everyone knows he’s not really up to it. At the beginning, you all acted like he was the perfect Indian boy. At the beginning, everyone acted like he was the perfect Indian boy. It’s ’cause you just go off the CV on paper. Right? You don’t know what I know. What does it say on the CV? Fucking anyone could’ve done that. What? Piece of piss. Who cares? What? All right, fair enough. What’s the guy done? Fair enough. Does well at school. Gets into Oxford. Does well at Oxford. Gets into Stanford. Does well at Stanford. Starts working in finance. Becomes a multi-multimillionaire in his own right in his twenties, largely through executing positions as a big short in 2007-2008 that makes him rich enough that he’d never have to work again. No one even reflects on that ’cause at Stanford, he meets and eventually marries the daughter of a genuine Indian billionaire, who’s a very successful businesswoman in her own right. They move to the United Kingdom where he becomes an MP at an obscenely young age, Chancellor at an obscenely young age, during one of the worst financial crises this country’s experienced, then prime minister, at an obscenely young age, of the country that colonised and expropriated the wealth of his ancestors, leading to complex migratory patterns, in his family’s case, via East Africa, landing him on the doorstep of the most significant address in this country on the most significant day of his faith, and everyone acts like he’s the perfect Indian boy. Feel free to look this up. It is genuinely true. Rishi Sunak never made his school cricket team. I was captain of mine. [cheering and applause] That’s right! That is right! Any Indian father would dropkick the prime minister into a canal to get me. All right? Know what I mean? “Who cares about Rishi Sunak? I want Ahir Tendulkar. Mmm.” “Hearing a lot about Number Ten. Should be batting at number four.” “That’s classy.” His family came here in the ’60s too. Like, I… I think about that sometimes. Getting into my time machine and travelling to that cold bedsit in Bradford and explaining to my grandfather that when his grandson was a bit older than he was then, not only would this be the case, but I think the bit that he’d struggle with the most is that it’s not a thing. Do you know what I mean? The news was just like, “And the prime minister, Rishi Sunak,” and everyone’s like, “Yeah, that makes sense.” It is remarkable how unremarkable it is, right? That’s a thing that’s worth reflecting upon. Listen, I’ll always talk about the things we do badly as a country. I think one of the things we do terribly as a country is never discussing anything we do well as a country. And I do think that when we’re at our best, Britain stands basically alone, certainly in Europe, probably in the world, as an example of what a properly successful multiethnic, multicultural democracy can look like in practice in the 21st century. That’s something that is worth discussing. It’s why I hate it when you get people on the far right decrying that multiculturalism is some grand failed experiment, when you can see its successes if you bother to open your eyes. It’s why I can’t stand it when people on my own “team”, right? I don’t like teams in the first place, but listen. I voted remain, but whenever people are like, “It was only the European Union that gave us our values of tolerance and decency to…” Fuck off! Anyone else in the room ever been to continental Europe while not white? It’s not the relaxing holidaying experience that some of the rest of you may enjoy. Genuinely. A couple of years ago, I had to go to this wedding in France. I genuinely… The way people were… I kept asking people I was with… Like, I thought I had something on me. Turns out I did! Gonna get an Algerian president of France anytime soon, or reckon the fash’ll get there first? Same question for Germany, you know? Listen, I think that Britain stands basically alone in this. That’s worth reflecting on, right? I remember when I was 20 years old, walking across the Meadows on the south side of Edinburgh with my friend the Indian American comedian Hari Kondabolu, right? I said to him, “Hari bhai…“ I think that when you’re part of any sort of visible minority, whatever that minority might be, what you fundamentally want in life, it’s not necessarily different treatment or special treatment. Rather, it is the ability, eventually, to get to go without saying. To be part of what is. Just to, sort of, get to be normal. I think if you get to be normal 24-7, you probably don’t realise how cool it is to get to be normal all the time. And does political representation get us there in and of itself? Of course it doesn’t, right? We know this for a fact. Rishi Sunak, not even the first PM from a minority-ethnic background. First, way back in the 19th century, Benjamin Disraeli, also a Tory, right? Would you say that antisemitism does not exist in contemporary Britain? That would be a fucking stupid thing to say. But maybe these things are indicative of the fact that, in societies, we can, over time, move towards a position where more and more people can be brought into the circle of who gets to go without saying, until that sphere is eventually expanded to include everyone, which is where it should’ve been in the first fuckin’ place. I have had the very great privilege of seeing a large amount of this world through these eyes. I have been to many countries, cities, continents doing this, and I can comfortably say that Britain is, yes, as the cliché goes, “the least racist country in the world”. It just says a shitload more about the world than about Britain. Right? And please do not interpret this as any sort of grand political point. I think the guy’s a fucking appalling prime minister. He’s, like, genuinely terrible, and no one voted for any of this. It is abysmal what is happening to us at the moment. I do not agree with his politics, but… By the way, that’s when you know that something historic’s happened. People use phrases like, “I may not agree with the politics, but…” [emphatically] No one felt the need with David Cameron. It’s just nice for someone like that to get a girl, isn’t it? Right, but Sunak and Cameron are basically the same guy ’cause they went to fancy school. That’s what explains it. Fancy school, and fancy school runs the country. That is not the school that I think about when I think about the prime minister. The school that I think about is quite a long time ago and quite a long way away. In April 1919, an event occurred in Amritsar, Punjab, at the time British India, that is now known to history as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre. This is when thousands of entirely unarmed civilians, peaceful protesters and pilgrims were kettled into a very, very small area, and tens of thousands of rounds of machine-gun fire were opened up intentionally on these entirely unarmed civilians, at least 379 of whom were murdered, probably many more, though we’ll never know the true total, and thousands more had life-defining injuries thereafter. It is one of the worst and most well-documented cases of colonial atrocities of British rule in India. I’ve known about that a very long time. What I did not know about, until an investigation in The Times last year, was that subsequent to the massacre in Amritsar, there was a sequence of additional smaller massacres perpetrated in towns and villages surrounding Amritsar as the word got out in order to stop the possibility of any subsequent civilian uprisings, including one that happened in a place called Gujranwala, right? Now, Gujranwala, it’s about 100 miles away from Amritsar. It’s a border town in contemporary Pakistan. And in Gujranwala, again, thousands of rounds of machine-gun fire were let out at entirely unarmed… just farmers tilling their fields. And over the course of two days, ten bombs were dropped, including one intentionally dropped on the school as a show of “This is how powerful we are and how little of a shit we give about you, so don’t you even think about trying to fuck with us.” One of the survivors of the massacre in Gujranwala was a two-year-old boy named Ramdas. Ramdas’s grandson is, at time of recording, prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Yeah. [applause] When… when I think about the last century of world history and what might prove possible over time and generations, I think about the school in Gujranwala rather more than I think about Winchester College. A punchline would feel distasteful. [laughter] Right? Obviously, I wasn’t alive at the time, but I reckon the way I feel’s basically how a lot of women felt about Margaret Thatcher in 1979. You don’t need to agree with someone’s politics in order to acknowledge that someone walking through the door means something in and of itself, and that’s the only way you pave the pathway for others to follow. And you can’t deny that it works. You can’t deny that it… Listen. We’ve now had enough white-lady prime ministers that they’re allowed to be instantly shit! That is a staggering achievement for equality in this country. Are you kidding me? Maggie and Theresa walked so Liz could fly. Liz Truss, actually very important from a representational standpoint as well. Uh, I mean that entirely sincerely too. Think about how many prime ministers there must’ve been over however long it’s been. Did you know that Liz Truss is the first who just went to a regular comprehensive school? Isn’t that mad, right? Like, 94% of children go to a regular comprehensive school. I went to a regular comprehensive school. I believe 94% of prime ministers should go to a regular comprehensive school. Admittedly, she wasn’t a great advert for us. Right? “I may not agree with her politics, but…” In case you’re trying to square the circle of the educational background and the accent you’re currently enjoying… Uh, well, uh… What ended up happening there was I went to my local comp in Wembley, North West London. I had a wonderful time there, but it did have a few police vans outside to stop us murdering each other. Very thoughtful of them. Subsequent to that, I ended up going to the University of Cambridge, so I became functionally bilingual in both posh boy and roadman. Uh, uh… A few years ago, I was doing a TV record in Glasgow, and afterwards, I was having a cigarette with my friend the comedian Jamali Maddix. I was there with Jamali, smoking, making small talk. He went, “You went private school, yeah?” I’m like, “Oh no, I didn’t.” “What?” So I talked him through a few basic facts about my childhood, and he just looked at me and went, “Hang on, bruv, are you from ends?” [posher accent] “Well, Jamali, one supposes one was.” I’m not gonna do it down. I grew up in a wonderful place. I went to a wonderful school. I hate when people do that down. I… genuinely, it was a really good school. If you avoided gang violence, cousin marriage, it was Ofsted Good. Like, it was a great environment. All the families, by and large like mine. First-, second-generation immigrants. Parents may not have had a lot to give. What they had was the most important. An insistence that education is the best way onward, upward, outward. I think if you’ve got 100 grand, that’s a better thing to give to a child. And blessed with really great teachers. I’ll tell you about one of my favourites, Miss Lewis. Now, Miss Lewis, I think she had previously taught at a private school. I don’t know, but she definitely knew the extras they were given in order to get ahead. Maybe thought that was unfair, right? And so she set up, off her own initiative, like all great teachers do, off her own bat, she set up, for a couple of years, an additional, optional Latin class, of all things. And I, as you can probably imagine, was heavily involved. This is what I mean about the transformative power of education. You could change everything for young people in an instant. I still remember, like it was yesterday, the first time I walked into that gleaming Portakabin bestowed on us by New Labour, and I sat down, and I opened these textbooks that contained these things that I’d never even conceived of before. I was just there being like, “Oh my God, it’s true!” “Caecilius est in horto!” Do you know what I mean, right? Led to probably my single favourite experience of my entire time at high school, which was one time, at the end of term, my boys and I were gonna go cinema ’cause you get a half day. The way that you go to the cinema, you get the 182 from Brent Town Hall. So we were walking to the bus stop, and on the way to the bus stop, there’s this blind alley, right? And a dozen guys came out to rush us and jack us and shit, until one of them just stopped all of the others by going, “Guys, Ahir’s safe, yeah? I know him from Latin.” I sincerely believe I am the only man in the long history of this sceptred isle who has ever avoided a violent mugging because of Latin class. Uh… [chuckles] Nathaniel, gratias tibi. It’s a great environment to grow up in, you know? Not much cash but a lot of ambition. I think that’s a good way around to have it, generally speaking. And realistic ambition as well. The families just had realistic ambitions. The sort of ambition every parent should be able to rely on. The idea that if everyone does their bit, works hard, the next generation might have it a bit easier than the previous one did. That is a reasonable ambition. Parents should be able to rely on that coming true for their children. Right, now this is not an unreasonable ambition. I know all about unreasonable ambition. You don’t need to tell me about… I remember once, when I was at uni, entirely unironically telling my mate Ali that by the time I was in my thirties, I wanted to be GQ magazine’s World’s Best Dressed Man. Right? I am now in my thirties and will settle for “Dressed Man”. [chuckles] And that’s a stretch most days. Listen, we all know, fundamentally, that any sort of vision of progress has to take into account generational investment. I think that the part that we’ve forgotten is that the flip side of that coin has always been generational sacrifice. Now, I might not know much about generational investment yet, but I feel like, through example, I at least know something about generational sacrifice because every day after primary school, I would go to my grandparents’ house in Alperton, North West London, and I would see generational sacrifice continuing to write itself on the faces of Nanaji and Nanima. Now, quick note on language. I speak another language. It’s called Gujarati. “Nanaji” just means your mum’s dad. You have different words for both sides of the family. So maternal grandfather, that’s nanaji. As you can imagine, I write a lot of stuff on my computer. My computer refuses to accept the existence of the word “nanaji” and will insist on autocorrecting it every time to the word “Navajo”. Which has led to three instances where I, alone at home, have yelled at a computer screen, “Wrong sort of Indian!” Now, Nanaji was the first member of my family to arrive in this country when he was in his twenties in 1964. He is probably the reason that I was born here in the first place. He is the reason for so much. Even though he died a fair while ago now, he’s probably the largest part of the reason why I ended up sounding like this, right? When he was eventually reunited with his wife and children in this country, he said to the children, including my mother, “Listen, when you’re outside, you’re not allowed to speak to one another in Gujarati any more.” “You live somewhere called England now, so you need to learn how to speak like proper little Englishmen and women.” “And then if you learn how to do that, maybe one day, they’ll learn how to accept you.” And it sounds kind of weird to our contemporary ears, but this was a very commonplace thing in the ’60s and ’70s. A sort of, like, vocal version of dressing for the job you want. You ever heard that phrase, right? And this has been entirely useless for me, but, like, my uncle is a doctor. Can you imagine if your doctor looked and sounded like me? You’d be fucking thrilled. Imagine that, he’s doing the ward rounds, just like, “Oh, good morning. How are we feeling today?” You’re thinking, “This motherfucker’s gonna cure me in two hours.” “Make lunch plans!” Now, Nanaji could never integrate in that way himself, so I think that his way of doing it was that he worked a succession of almost comically English jobs, right? So for the most part of his career, until he retired, he worked at John Lewis. Worked on the shop floor, selling curtains, fabrics ’cause it’s what he knew from the textile factories back in India. That’s probably the most English place anyone could possibly work. You’re not gonna get a more English place to work than the John Lewis Partnership. Unless the job you had before that was conductor on the big, red bus! “Fair play. That’s the most English place anyone could possibly work.” “You can’t hit us with a more English workplace than the big, red bus.” Unless the first job you had in this country was literally at the baked-bean factory! It’s where it all started. Baked-bean factory in Bradford. 1964, baby. Came over here. Work on those beans. Now, uh, crucially, he did not want to, uh, right? By that stage, been married for just under a decade. Had three children. Had friends. Enjoyed his work in the textile factory. Thought he might be able to work his way up and everything. Very little interest in the United Kingdom. Hitherto no interest in beans, right? But, um… It was my grandmother who pushed this. Like, Nani, quite understandably, was like, “Listen, just…” India at the time is just poorer and more violent than anyone with the dumb luck of having been born in this country can remotely conceive of. And so she, quite understandably, was like, “Listen, these children aren’t gonna have the life we wanna give them over here, but they’re taking people in England.” “So I need you to go over there. You just work it out, right?” “I’ll stay here with the children. You send money back to us.” “When you’ve saved up enough, we’ll come join you.” “All right. Cool. See you later. Bye.” Uh… He just did it, like, pretty soon thereafter. Just went… Like, listen, I like to think that I’m gonna be a pretty, sort of, accepting, thoughtful, 50-50 type of husband, right? However, if, just under a decade from now, my wife is to tell me that I must leave her and our three children to move to a different continent with no guarantee of when I would see them again, no way of communicating with them, no guarantee if any of it was going to work out and no guarantee of my own personal safety, that would not be the end of the conversation. Right? However, of course, for Nanaji, it was. How could it not be? That’s your dharma. That’s your duty. You have to do it. It’s your duty to your family, right? So he came over, not entirely on his own. Came with a couple of other guys who did the same, left the wives and kids. But they didn’t really see each other that much for a few years ’cause they ran a system called the eight-eight-eight, right? The eight-eight-eight is a system whereby, as mathematicians in the room can confirm, if three men each have two jobs, the shifts of which are eight hours long, and you time the shift patterns correctly and work seven days a week, you only need to rent one bed in one room because one of you can be asleep at any given time while the other two are at work. One guy finishes his second shift, comes back, hits you awake, you go off to your first one, he falls asleep. Do that again and again. Saves two-thirds on the rent. That’s more that you can send to the wives and kids in India. And that’s the largest expense, isn’t it? What’s the second-largest expense? Probably food. But food, taken care of. ‘Cause at the baked-bean factory, they give you a tin of beans. Protein. Very important. For the second meal of the day, they had a big sack of rice, and they’d have some boiled rice in a pot. Apart from Sundays, obviously, because Sunday is treat day, so the boiled rice contained an onion, right? Some of you are probably thinking, “Surely, even in 1964, onions are cheap.” “Anyone could have onions whenever they wanted.” From what you have heard so far about my nanima, do you believe she is the sort of woman who would have tolerated the profligacy of a seven-a-week onion habit? It’s what you needed to do. It’s what they needed you to do, so it’s what you did. Eight-eight-eight, 24-7, 365. Five. Five years. He didn’t see his wife or children for five years. Imagine that. It’s not like, “At least I’ve got a good data plan” or something like that. Forget about calling. That was never gonna happen. Letters? Couple of letters a year. Each time you write one, you feel a bit closer. Every time you buy a stamp, you’re driving them further away. To the extent that my mum’s first memory in this country is Heathrow Airport, 1969. Her, her brother and sister all sort of hid behind their mum because they were just like, “Who’s this man?” Right? “Who’s this big man?” Right? Just like, “Why’s he smiling at me?” “Why’s he got these tears in his eyes?” “I guess he looks like that photograph that Mummy cries over sometimes if anyone ever hums that song, you know?” I think about that a lot too, right? Imagine that. Trying to raise three children on your own for five years, occasionally just crying over a single photograph and a handful of letters. Should’ve cried over a lime. She’d have made some money. Family reunited in 1969, the year after a very prominent Conservative politician got on a soapbox in Birmingham and said, “We must be mad, literally mad, to be permitting the annual inflow of dependents, who are, for the most part, the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population.” “It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre.” Now, Mr Powell was correct about one thing in that that little girl hidden behind the sari did become part of the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population. Because that’s quite a mouthful, my sister and I tend to go with “Mum”. Imagine that. Bringing your wife and kids into that the year after Rivers of Blood, when you’ve been here on your own since ’64, the same year as the Smethwick campaign. Right? It’s fucking grim. Right, just like the violence, the aggression, that goes without saying. It’s also… It’s always the more insidious stuff that cuts the deepest, yeah? The thing, I suppose, like, nowadays, we acknowledge as having broken him was that he was eventually, uh, accused of quite serious theft from the workplace, uh, which was, like… Suspended and investigated for ages. Entirely cleared. He’d obviously not done it. But it didn’t take a genius to work out eventually when you hear these stories, that it all starts with a couple of guys at the place being like, “Who do you reckon they’re gonna believe, eh?” Imagine what that does to you. Like, your dignity and stuff. You have to do it again though. Tomorrow. You have to get up, brave face, for the kids. For the kids. It’s not like the kids have it any easier. There has been so much more progress in the last 20 years in this country than there was in the 40 that preceded it, and I feel very comfortable saying that because I went to exactly the same high school as my mum and my uncle. My abiding memory of that school is a funny story about the time when I didn’t get mugged ’cause of Latin. Ha-ha-ha. My uncle’s abiding memory of that school is the people who would flick lit cigarettes at him every day when he walked to and from it. My mum’s abiding memory of that school sticks with her to this day because every time she wants to eat something, she has to change her clothes entirely, cook, eat, change her clothes entirely again. No matter how many times I tell her that the smell of spices hitting hot oil is the most beautiful smell in the world, all she hears is a decade of children telling her how much she stank. And he died in 2002, so he died only remembering the shit bit, and he wasn’t old, so if he’d just hung on, he would have seen how quickly it was going to get so different. You could have at least seen a bit of that before you left. Right, in 2016, I’m on a train, reading a newspaper. Sorry, mate. A newspaper. Right, um… Imagine, like, a solid tweet. Right, and… and… On a train, reading a newspaper, and it’s the day before the mayoral election in London, and there’s this big feature article, uh, where basically Sadiq Uncle is walking around the city, meeting the various voters and talking to them. In the feature, there’s this one guy. I’ve forgotten his name. It was a West African name, I think. He’s there with his five-year-old son, and he says to him, “Son, I want you to shake this man’s hand.” “This is Mr Khan.” “Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London.” And in that moment of reading that, like, my hands stopped working, and the paper fell from my hands, and the tears fell from my eyes as I thought about the fact that he died in a society where the sentence, “This is Mr Khan. Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London,” was completely impossible, right? And yet 14 years later, it had become totally inevitable. So what would he have made of witnessing the change in society necessary to make that happen and landing on that sentence in that paper? What would he have made of reading a sentence like that? What would he have made of reading the words, “This is Mr Khan. Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London”? Probably not much. I don’t think he really liked Muslims. “I may not agree with his politics, but…” And that’s how I felt Diwali before last, you know? Lit my divo, I went outside. I went back into the kitchen, and I poured a little glass of whisky, and I said, “You finding today interesting, eh?” It’s, like, obviously, problems still exist. None of this is to negate any of the problems that we’re all too aware of, right? But at the same time, pretending that the sort of stuff that I have and have had to contend with is in any way comparable to the sort of things that they had to deal with feels genuinely offensive to me. ‘Cause this was the generation that never talked about it and so never had it acknowledged, and it’s worth acknowledging. ‘Cause they’re the ones who changed so much to make so much of what happens now possible, right? I’m not an idiot. I wander around doing this for a living, all around the country. Occasionally, people shout ignorant shit at me in the street. Like, I’m not oblivious to that. And listen, my wife is a white Irish lady. Sometimes the two of us are going about our business, out and about, and people see us together. They don’t like that too much. They make their opinions known. They’re all so fuckin’ old, right? So old. Like, proper fossils, and… When I was a teenager, it would really… Like, I’d be ready to fight, and now a part of my brain just can’t help but think, “F… I think maybe you lost,” right? No, not… Lost isn’t correct ’cause it’s not like society’s a football match where someone blows the whistle and we decide what the result’s been. But at the very least, I can acknowledge that I’m not the one who scored the goals. I’m a sub. They’re the ones who scored the goals. They scored the goals and ran straight back to the net and pulled it back to the halfway line ’cause they knew that no matter how hard they were trying every single day, they were still, 1969, two down, right? And is the point of my generation one more not only of maintenance but also trying not to lose grip on this extraordinarily fragile thing that exists around us? It’s worth acknowledging how fragile this thing is, right, because you see people, young people, trying, once again, to sow, sort of, any sorts of division in this society we’re trying to build. And you just think, “What the fuck are you doing?” “What are you doing?” Surely, the point… If the point is anything, the point is to create a society in which, one day, everyone’s children get to go without saying. I think that you have to be staggeringly naive to believe that that’s possible, and I refuse to be anything else. It’s so easy to despair, right? Despair is the easiest position to have. It’s definitely my default. It just turns out that despair is a deeply unproductive emotion. Right? Try something else. Yeah? My wife’s way better than me at this. Like, she’s just, generally speaking, quite stable and well adjusted. I used to think that she was some sort of superhero or something. Turned out it’s because she has absolutely no social-media presence whatsoever. Uses the internet sparingly if necessary for work. If we were all slightly more like her, we’d all be slightly less fucking insane. By the way, no one’s changed their names. There’s no Mrs Shah to this story. Fortunately for all of us, in Irish, her name means “Prostitute Queen”. Didn’t even take five weeks, not really. There was a point, one week, stood opposite her in the kitchen, and just all of a sudden, it’s like the trailers stopped. Like all life up to that point had revealed itself to be the trailers, and all of a sudden, every atom of the world outside of the two of us was whispering in unison, “Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh. Shh.” [softly] “The picture’s about to start.” And now I get to see how it goes. That’s it. I mean, the ending’s gonna suck. Right. I’m not gonna know too much about it though. 100% gonna die first. Get in! Love it. Are you kidding me? Listen. It’s like… She’s really like, “Oh no, we shouldn’t have processed food in the house.” And all I want to do in my life is fuck a Chicago Town pizza. While chain-smoking and doing lines of salt. It’s nice to feel like you’ve had one of your last beginnings. Yeah? Frees you up to think about where things end up. It’s the interesting thing with love, right? Love, the way that it begins, begins in as many ways as there are people. If we were ever to have a conversation, and you said to me, “Ahir, can I just check, were you in love on your wedding day?” Wouldn’t that be a ridiculous question? You’d never ask. ‘Cause the answer’s obviously yes, right? What I find fascinating is that, if you were ever to meet my grandmother, and you were to say, “Ramila, can I check, on your wedding day, were you in love?” It would be an equally ridiculous question ’cause the answer would obviously be no. Of course she wasn’t. Right? There she was, little more than a girl, sat opposite little more than a boy. Total strangers, functionally. Of course she didn’t love that boy. Right? And yet it began. It began, right? Wild. Did she love the boy she was sat opposite on her wedding day? Of course she didn’t, right? Did she love the young man just under a decade later, who was willing to move continents because he knew that’s what the people who relied on him needed from him in that moment? Of course she loved that man. She loved that man for the next five years as she held up her end looking after three children, while occasionally taking a moment to cry over a photograph and a handful of letters. Of course she loved that man. She loved that man in Heathrow Airport, 1969, the photograph made flesh once more as those three children hid behind her sari because they barely recognised the man who had done so much for them. Of course she loved that man. She loved that man as she took his hand and walked forward together into a society infinitely more hostile than the one that has been bequeathed to me as a direct result of their actions. She loved that man as they danced together, shielding one another from as many slings and arrows as humanly possible. For the next decades until his end, she loved that man. She loved that man in 2002 and well past that, as you will know if you go to a living room in Alperton, North West London, and see a photograph on the wall with a fresh garland of flowers that you pray to when you visit. Of course she loves that man. That’s where it ends up. Nanaji died in 2002, a week after his birthday. He’d just turned 69. Oi! [chuckles softly] He’d brought a slightly hastened end onto himself, really, uh… Basically, when he retired, he wanted to spend as much time in India as humanly possible, but his lungs had been fucked since his twenties ’cause of the fibres in the air in the textile mills. The place in India my family are historically from, a city called Ahmedabad, it’s incredibly polluted. Makes Central London look like the fucking Peak District. And so he would go over there and come back weaker, diminished. And he came back, and after the second trip, his grown-up children had to get him sat down in his own living room, and my mum had to say to her own dad, “You are killing yourself.” Right? “That’s what’s happening here. That’s what’s… It’s perfectly clear.” “You go there. You come back. You’re weaker. You’re smaller.” “You’re more diminished.” “And can you not see what is happening to you?” “It’s not even about seeing. Akshay is a doctor.” “He can hear what is happening based on your breath and diagnose you.” “Do you not feel what is happening?” “So here’s the thing. You’ve had your fun. You’ve had two trips.” “But now you stay over here, right?” ” ‘Cause we love you very much, so we wanna keep you around.” “That’s how we’re all gonna look after one another.” “So you’ve had your fun, but you’re not allowed to go any more.” “Here you are. Good. Yes.” And he had to look at three adult children and say, “No.” “I never wanted any of this. Right, I never wanted any…” “Like, my entire life, it turns out, has just been this means to an end, and that’s fine. It’s fine because you are the end.” “So if I had to do it again, I would, with a snap of the fingers and a smile on my face, I would do it again.” “But can you not understand that I just need this at my end?” “I can feel it far more than you can see it, or he can hear it.” “Do you not understand I don’t care?” “I don’t care because when I go over there, no one looks at me like I’m any different or yells at me or spits at me like I’m any different because I’m not any different.” “When I go over there, I am a normal guy.” “I have been a normal guy since the day I was born.” “I just haven’t felt like it in so long.” “You don’t understand that when I’m over there, I get to go without saying, and I haven’t gone without saying since nineteen sixty-fucking-four.” He used to run off the plane as quickly as possible, sprint across the tarmac as quick as fucked lungs would carry him, and go to the first part of the airport that wasn’t paved over, fall to his knees and just start digging fistfuls of earth with his bare hands. He would dig up the earth, and he would put it in his mouth. Can you imagine? Dig the earth and put… ‘Cause you miss a land so much that you need to dig it and put it in your mouth. But you had to leave, you had to leave because that’s what they needed, and if they needed it, it’s what you had to do. He would dig the earth and put it in his mouth. It can’t have helped. [laughter] A third and final trip to the only place on the face of this earth that would do a normal guy the basic decency of getting to go without saying. And it killed him. That’s how much every human being wants that. You need a pretty damn good reason not to give it to them. When he did die, he died in this country, in a hospital. D’you remember? “Hospital”. And my mother was next to him, sat down. He was in a bed, not speaking any more. It was just the beeps, you know? Most of us have heard the beeps. And a nurse came by, saw my mum, and said, “Oh, you must be Mr Vaishnaw’s daughter.” She said, “Yes, I am.” And the nurse said, “Well, listen, I’m new to the ward, so I didn’t get a chance to speak to him, but I’ve spoken to some of the other nurses who did, and they said he was a good man.” And my mother squeezed the hand of a man she had barely recognised in Heathrow Airport in 1969 and said, “He was the best of men.” And the line went flat. And if Nanaji were capable of hearing in that moment, then the very last thing he heard on this earth was the little girl it had all been for saying that he was the best of men. And, like, objectively, he wasn’t. [laughter] Do you know what I mean? Not a baddie, but just, you know, a normal, complex, flawed human being like absolutely everyone in this room. And probably we could give one another a bit more of a break than we currently have the appetite for, I suppose. Yeah? But for someone, for someone, which it turns out is the only way that you can be, of course he was. He was the best of people for someone. He did what they needed from him when they needed it from him. He did the best that he could for the people he loved. If you can do that, then you can be the best of people for someone. If you can do the best you can for the people you love and who rely on you, then you damn well get to go without saying, in my book. It is not that I have currently had some sort of grand revelation that sacrifice is somehow more impressive or important than achievement. The truth is what the truth always was in the first place, which is that the sacrifice is the achievement, and with that in mind, I know full well that till my end, Krishnadas Vaishnaw will remain the most impressive man I will ever meet. I have wanted to do this since January 1998, sat on the floor of my grandparents’ living room in Alperton, North West London, listening to Nanaji and Nanima laugh at episode one of Goodness Gracious Me. And for just over a decade, I have had the absurd privilege of calling it my career. But it’s not the job. Not any more. And it never will be again, I hope. The job, as I understand it, is what Nanaji understood the job to be. He was a good husband and a good father for the people who needed him to be when they needed him to be. He was the best of men. And I am now, in front of you, the World’s Best Dressed Man. [laughter and applause] Because I get to stand in front of you and tell his story while wearing his waistcoat. Because I am finally dressed for the job I want. And it will be the hardest job of a lifetime. [in Gujarati] But with you, Nanaji, I’ll be able to do it, I hope. Sorry. “Hope…” [laughter] [cheering and applause] Thank you very much. [Qawwali music playing] [music ends]\"],\n",
              " 'kerman': [\"Langston Kerman: Bad Poetry (2024)\\nDirector: John Mulaney\\nRelease date: August 20, 2024 (Netflix) [ambient street noise] [applause] [emcee] Clap it up, clap it up! Clap it up, clap it up, clap it up! Keep clapping! Clap it up! [audience cheering] [emcee] Keep clapping! You gotta clap! Everybody clap! Clap it up! Clap it up! Don’t slow down. Clap it up! Clap it up! We gonna clap it up for 20 minutes! Clap it up! [applause, cheering] All right, this next brother coming up, he’s supposed to be telling y’all jokes. Now, I can’t verify he’s funny, but he is, indeed, light-skinned. And some people are into that. Give it up for Langston Kerman! [audience cheering] What up, Chicago? Yeah! Look at y’all. This is dope. Thank you for being here. Some of y’all got your winter titties out. This is cool. This is so dope. I hope everybody’s feeling good. I hope you’re having a good night. I’m doing… I’m doing great. I had a phenomenal thing happen to me very recently. Like, unbelievable shit. I’ll tell you. After months, months of persuasion, my mother-in-law finally put me in charge of her dating apps. [audience laughs] Do you understand? I’m pretending to be a 65-year-old woman trying to get her back blown out… [audience laughs] …on an elderly dating app called “Sunset Singles.” And I’ll be honest, I’m having the time of my goddamn life. I wake up every day. Before I greet my wife, before I unstick my balls from my thigh, I pick up my phone, I open that app, and I just start flirting. I be flirting with old-ass men in big-ass suits. You know what I mean? Turns out that’s my type. I thought I liked my wife. I don’t. I like a leathery old sea turtle. I like a wooden-teeth-looking motherfucker, with his face too close to the phone in all his pictures. And they be sending me messages like, “Greetings, beloved.” “My name is Ulysses.” “That’s right! The last Ulysses alive on planet Earth.” “All other Ulysses died in the Great Black & Mild War of 1964.” “Anyway, I am electric mailing you this evening…” [audience laughs] “…to inquire if you might join me on a Cadillac ride to a crab cake dinner.” “I know a place with pictures of Barack Obama in the menu, so you know it’s good.” “Sound enticing? Call me on my house phone.” “I’m terrified of technology.” Lot of people don’t believe me, that this is a thing I’ve been doing. Trying to fuck these old men. [audience laughs] They think I’m making this up. And so what I’ve done, what I’ve actually started to do, is I’ve actually started to compile some of the audio messages… [audience murmurs] [audience member] Yeah! What’s wrong? You don’t like elder abuse? You don’t like taking advantage of our most vulnerable communities? Agreed to disagree. What I’ve done is I’ve compiled some of the audio messages that these men send and post, and I want to share some of them with you tonight Is that okay? Can I do that? [audience cheers] Yeah. Oh, you changed your mind? Goddamn turncoat. Okay, this first message… No, nay. This first piece I want to share with you this evening, this first selection, is a little number that I’ve simply entitled “Love.” “Love.” That’s all you need to know. We’ll play it for you now. [man 1] I love so many things. I love everything. I love… Mostly, I love… God, I love things. I do like them. It’s just, right now, mind’s reached a blank. But love, love is all there is. Okay. [laughs] Yeah. Gotta love it. You gotta love love. Says it all. I love to love. I live to love. I am a being of love. I asked this motherfucker where he likes to eat. [laughter] I didn’t ask him none of that. He came back with this weird-ass love manifesto. Like, I see why you’re single, sir. It sounds like you love keeping women’s hair in jars. You odd bitch. I am doing well, man. I… I’m, uh… I’m a father now. [audience cheering] I have a small baby at home. Yeah! Thank you! It’s very exciting. I love her so much. I might have made a huge mistake. Who knows? How do you know? You know what I mean? That’s not a familiar feeling? Nobody else feels like a bird trapped in the airport? Don’t get me wrong, ’cause I don’t want anybody… I… I love my baby. Right? Hey, hey, hey. Top five baby, aborted or alive. I love… [laughter] I love my baby! Look, hey, hey, hey, when I show people pictures of my baby, and they don’t get excited enough, I be ready to beat they ass. Know what I’m saying? If I show you a picture of my baby, and you just go, “I dunno, she’s cute,” I’d be like, “No, bitch.” “She’s an effervescent beauty.” “I think you meant to say her cheeks remind you of the clouds that wrap around mountaintops.” “Tell me she makes you feel like the warmest day in winter.” “Say you want to kiss her, softly.” “Slowly.” “That’s right.” “You a pedophile for my baby.” “You going to jail, you sick fuck.” “‘Cause you wanna Joe-Biden-sniff my baby.” People say wild shit to me now that I have a kid. You know what I mean? Real maniacal, evil shit. I had a stranger I’ve never met before in my life come up to me the other day and tell me having a baby is the best thing that’s ever gonna happen to me. The best thing. And keep in mind, I once met Forest Whitaker in line at an IHOP. [laughter] Ghost Dog. I met him at the International House. This is how it happened, right? I was in line, minding my business, and out of nowhere, Forest Whitaker walked in and he asked to use the bathroom. And then the woman behind the register, she looked at him, she realized, “Holy shit, that’s Forest Whitaker,” and then she said the bathroom was for paying customers only. And Forest Whitaker couldn’t believe it. He was taken aback. He looked at her as if to say, “Ma’am, have you lost your mind?” “I’m Forest goddamn Whitaker.” “You’ve seen my eye.” But the woman didn’t budge a bit. She just looked right back at him and rolled her neck as if to say, “Sir, you ain’t special.” “This is an IHOP.” “Everybody’s got a fucked-up eye.” “We all fucked-up in the ‘HOP.” “That’s how we got here!” And there was this crazy stand-off, right, between Forest Whitaker and the pancake lady, neither one of them budging a bit, and then out of nowhere, my boy, Will… He was outside smoking. He comes back in. He sees Forest Whitaker. He goes, “Oh shit! Forest Whitaker?” “You eat at IHOP?” “Weird choice!” And I’ll never forget it, because Academy-Award-winner Forest Whitaker, he looked at us, he looked at everybody in the restaurant, and he just went, “Man…” “Fuck y’all.” Best thing. Know why “best thing” is crazy? Because you and I, every single person in this room, we’ve all had so many magical experiences that no human should ever have to weigh themselves against. Know what I mean? It’s almost unfair to ask you to compare your greatest joys to another. It’s… Look, hey, I’ve gotten pussy and Cinnabon in the same night. That’s a miracle. This is a better example. Okay, here it is. Okay, this… Okay. Last year, for my birthday, right, me and my friends, we did a shit-ton of mushrooms, right? We got super-high on mushrooms. Real fucked up on mushrooms. And then, we went to a public park, we sat on a bench, and then we heckled an adult softball league. You understand? That’s how I celebrated my 35th birthday. And I’ll be honest, that’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. So much funnier than a baby. This is why it was dope. Because those people had paid money to be there. The players, they had worked hard to organize themselves with registration fees and uniforms, all under the guise of spending this peaceful afternoon in the park playing sports with their friends, and then out of nowhere, a group of urban youth… White people can’t tell how old we are. A group of urban youth… Some rowdy eighth graders showed up and just started yelling weird, mushroom-y shit at them. Stuff that didn’t even make sense. I was sitting on a bench like, “Hey! Number three!” “You remember Bob Dole?” “You know Bob Dole? He was a politician, ’80s, ’90s, ran for president, never won.” “You remember Bob Dole?” “Remember he had that weird, fucked-up arm? Little arm.” “He had to keep a pen in it so nobody’d notice how mangled his little hand was.” “Remember Bob Dole?” “Well, you throw like Bob Dole!” “Fuck you, number three!” “Bob-Dole-throwing motherfucker.” This was the best part of the afternoon. At one point, at one point, the, um… the… the… the left fielder… and I guess I’m cautious to call him a left fielder because he was very clearly an office manager, you know what I mean? He wasn’t left field by trade. But the office manager in left field, he missed an easy pop fly, right? Easy pop fly goes over his head. He falls down. Super embarrassing moment. And then I took it upon myself. I stood up in front of everybody at the park. I stood up and I shouted, “Hey!” “I’m not angry, but your mother and I are very disappointed.” I shouted that in front of everybody. And what y’all have to understand is that that joke did fine here. Fine. Y’all are cool. But at the park? I fucking killed. You know what I mean? Y’all are okay, but at the park, I goddamn destroyed. Me and my friends, we were high-fiving and shit. Jogging bitches, they stopped. They were laughing. The Mexican man with the popsicles, he winked at me. Gave me a free Snoopy. Destroyed, right? But here’s what you also have to understand, is that when I said that, I was on mushrooms. Right? I was as high as the day is long. So when I said that, and me and this person in left field made eye contact, there was a brief moment where I was his father. You understand? I was this 40-year-old white man’s dad. And I’ll be honest, I was disappointed. Because this isn’t the life that I imagined for my white son. Maybe that’s good enough for your white boys, but not mine. No, sir, his mother and I had worked too hard, too hard, to give him a life he didn’t even earn. We paid off the DUI. We bribed the college admissions offices. We introduced him to people named Humphrey. And all we ever asked of him was that he not shame us. Don’t embarrass us in this public way. And I got so angry, so in my head rageful at what my son was doing, that out of nowhere, I shouted. I shouted in front of everybody, “Hey!” “I’m selling the house in the Berkshires and I’m cutting you out of the trust.” And then no one laughed, ’cause no one knew what the fuck I was talking about. Mexican man took back his popsicle. “Gimme that shit.” “Thought you were funny. You’re weird.” “You’re a weird guy at the park.” Best thing. You’re telling me I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to my parents? You? You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to your parents? Most of us still get embarrassed when we have to read out loud. The other day, I was reading my daughter a bedtime story, and I ran into the word “pterodactyl.” Fucked up my whole evening. I was just sitting there like, “What the fuck… is a ‘peterodasatill’?” See, see, see, this is the government trying to put the names of prescription drug medications in our children’s books! They trying to get my baby hooked on this shit. They trying to make my daughter a petero-head. Can’t be the best thing, man. There’s so much I’m dumb about, so much I don’t understand in the world. Okay, great example. Let’s talk about this. As it relates to COVID, right? Specifically the COVID vaccine. Am I the only person, am I the only one in this room, who thought Walgreens would have a separate staff? You know, like for the medical interventions. I thought there’d be, like, Walgreens doctors. And Walgreens nurses. It’s not. It’s the same n*ggas. It’s the same people who sell you batteries. Some of y’all don’t get it. Listen. Hey. Hey. The key for the deodorant and the key for the Moderna? It’s on the same ring. It’s just one dude being like, “Whatcha need, player? Yeah, I got you.” “Oh, Pfizer? Nah, I can’t get you the Pfizer.” “Gotta call the manager for the Pfizer.” “You want that Johnson & Johnson, I get you that right now.” “We keep that with the Hot Pockets. I can get you Johnson & Johnson.” “But Pfizer, we gotta call the manager. He got the big key.” “Also, please fill out this form, because I am now your primary care physician.” “We gon’ change up your diet. You eating string cheese.” “It’s on sale.” Can’t be the best thing, man. I still get hard when I ain’t supposed to be hard. Know what I mean? That’s not a threat. I don’t like how you’re looking. That’s not… I’m not threatening you. You enjoy your evening. I’m saying I get boners when I didn’t expect… to have a boner. Like when I’m waiting for the train. Everybody be looking at me like, “Damn, he really loves the train.” But I don’t. I’m not a train guy. I’m not. I just can’t help it. I… And I used to think it was just a me thing, you know? I used to think I was the only person hard in my local Chipotle. But after years of careful research, I’ve come to discover it’s not just a me thing. In fact, every dude in here has the exact same problem. Ladies, whether he’s ready to admit it or not, every dude has found himself at work, just in a marketing meeting, with a throbbing erection he can’t explain. Just avoiding pie charts, ’cause those are making it worse somehow. Like, “Oh God, are we at 98%?” “Lord.” “I’m about to bust. I can’t.” “I pray to God they don’t push that pie chart next to another pie chart, ’cause that’s titties, and I’mma cum.” “I’mma cum from that pie booty.” We can’t control our bodies. That’s why I don’t listen to anything men have to say about reproductive responsibility and the women… No. ‘Cause we be hard. [audience cheers] We be hard, and if you got a hard dick, you should maybe tuck it in your belt and shut the fuck up. I’m not trying to hear your hard-dick opinion. You can’t be erect and correct at the same time. Thank you. Hey, I’mma run for president. I’mma be up there giving speeches, hard as hell. Like, “Damn, Putin got them big bombs, don’t he? Shit!” “Putin bombs look like titties. Fuck!” “Big ol’ titty bombs.” I think I just have fear about what it means to raise a child, you know? To bring a person to their greatest potential, that’s scary. Fear, honestly, that existed throughout my wife’s entire pregnancy. Terrified, genuinely afraid. The entire time, I was terrified I was gonna end up with a white baby. Terrified. And I’ll explain it. It’s not as confusing as you think it is. I’m biracial, right? My mother’s Black, my father is white. My wife is the exact same mix. So… if I’m half-white, and she’s half-white, and recessive genes kick in, we could end up with a fucking daywalker. A little surprise white baby! Just a little tampon-colored Tyler, with varicose veins. Talking ’bout, “Daddy, I’m in the mood for poached eggs.” Ew! I don’t want a white baby! I don’t want a baby that ages like a Gypsy curse. Why does this baby look older than me? I hate it. Hate this white baby. And I don’t have anything against white people. I don’t. Honestly, I’m a big fan of your work. I really am. Rollerblades? Y’all did that. Don’t let anybody tell you you ain’t make rollerblades. Y’all are the reason we shred. Like I said, man, my father’s white, so I… Okay, this is the best way. This is it. Okay. It… Here it is. It’s hard to blame the white man for all of your problems when the white man still pays your cell phone bill. I’m on the devil’s family plan. I can’t… I can’t be that… You know what I mean? I can’t be up here like… [emphatically] “Brothers and sisters!” “I said, brothers and sisters, and maybe even Vin Diesel.” “It’s hard to tell with him. What color is that exactly?” “Periwinkle?” “Looking like a old-ass cauliflower.” “Anyway, we must overthrow the white man.” “We must bring every single white person to justice, except for the white people who send me money on my birthday.” “Also, the entire cast of The Office.” “They are hilarious.” “And whichever white person invented fruit on the bottom of yogurt.” “I tried it, I love it.” “I love it. The other day, I ate a boysenberry flavor.” “I took a good, healthy poop, and I thought, ‘Oh, this is why white people act like that.'” “Too much power. I feel too strong.” “I want to open a private prison and use a neti pot. I love it!” “Take my shoes off on a plane. I love it.” “Feels good.” Fear. Know what my biggest fear is with a kid? Genuinely, this is my biggest fear, is how do you make your kid into a good person? Do you know what I mean? If you have kids, if you’re a parent, and I think we can all agree on this, you’re just guessing. All of us. You’re… We plug in a formula. We plug in the exact same formula. You teach ’em to share, you give them motherfuckers vegetables and shit, and then you just hope. You just hope your kid doesn’t into, like, a serial killer. Or even worse, one of those people who draws Lion King characters with human titties. You remember those psychopaths in school? Those future Republican senators? Any cartoon titty kids here tonight? Anybody want to fess up to what they did? Nobody ever raises their hand, but statistically, that can’t be correct. The math don’t check out, ’cause every class I was in, I’d look over and some kid was disgracing the Disney corporation. And let’s be clear, ladies and gentlemen, That’s not what Walt Disney wanted. Walt… Walter Disney… Walt Disney wanted good, wholesome content. Also, to exterminate the Jews. He wanted dead Jews And good family-friendly content. And now you look over and some kid is drawing Zazu, just the bird from Lion King, with big, heavy lunch lady titties. Big casserole and spatula titties. Now the bird can’t fly. Talking about, “Simba, I can’t help you become king. My back hurts.” “What god would make me like this, Simba?” “Kill me.” How do you make them good? This is a… This is a weird transition after that titty joke, but… I used to be a high school teacher. That’s what I did before comedy. I taught 9th, 11th and 12th grade English. I’m the reason your kid pronounces it “liberry.” I coulda helped. I chose not to. I wanted to see them flail. Teaching’s tough, man. It… You… This is what made teaching so difficult for me, is that no matter how challenging a kid is, right, no matter how difficult a kid is, you have to maintain this hope, this faith, that they can still grow into better people. Right? That they can still find the best version of themselves. And that’s so hard, because so many kids deserve to be pepper sprayed. Right? They deserve to be Maced. In their fucking eyeballs. Until they learn to contribute to society. Some of the meanest things ever said to me came from children. Not my enemies. Little unwashed people. Motherfuckers who don’t wipe so good. This is the meanest thing anyone’s ever said to me. I had a little girl raise her hand, middle of class. She raised her hand to tell me she didn’t think I could ever become a professional male model, because I have too much adult acne. You understand? She interrupted class to tell me… Keep in mind, I wasn’t trying to be a male model. At all. I wasn’t doing nothing sexy. I was trying to teach this bitch to read. But something so hateful in her spirit saw me up there trying my best, and she thought to herself… [flatly] “Uh-uh.” “Uh-uh. No way. Uh-uh. Fuck that. Uh-uh.” “This motherfucker’s got too much confidence.” “No, this bumpy-faced n*gga, he believes in himself too much.” “I need to let him know that just in case he was thinking about changing careers, male model is not an option.” “I know he’s trying to make us think critically about literature, but fuck that.” “He needs to think about the back of a Proactiv bottle.” “His skin is terrible. He looks like multigrain. I’mma tell him.” “I’mma tell him he looks like bread.” There are kids who I taught that I still want to fight to this day. To this day, there’s this little bitch named Edna. I’ll decap Edna’s knees if I ever see her again. This is really what I want. Some of y’all might work in education. I think this’ll make sense. I want to stab Edna in the stomach, right? I wanna knife her up real good in the belly, and then afterward, I want to stuff the wound with Hot Cheetos so she’d die all spicy and shit. Fucking hate Edna. Edna’s the reason I stopped writing poetry. You understand? She stole the magic of verse from me. Let me be clear, this wasn’t my original dream. I didn’t want to perform behind a bar, you know what I mean? I wanted to be a poet. I was… Oh, man. I’m telling you, I was going to be a poet. I… Y’all, I… I was gonna write silky metaphors. I was gonna wear a thick tweed jacket. I was going to go down on weird ladies with hairy armpits. I was going to be a poet. And then I had to teach an after-school poetry program for Edna’s class. And every day, for eight consecutive weeks, that little girl hurt my feelings. She made me sad for two lunar cycles, and now I want her dead. This was a poetry class. And this is where I messed up. This was my mistake. I’m going to admit that up top. This is where I messed up. I thought the best way to get these kids to write their poems was for me to share one of my own. Right? Huge mis… Right. Yeah. I get it. I fucked up. I should have just read them Tupac lyrics like my teachers did for me. “Listen up, kids.” First off, fuck yo’ bitch And the clique you claim “That’s called a stanza.” Even worse, the poem that I read them was a poem that meant a lot to me at the time. It was a poem about a friend of mine who died in a car crash. This girl I know who died in a car crash. And in the poem, I do all this metaphorical work to compare her death to the death of a spider I found in my windowsill. And the final lines of the poem go… The exact final lines of the poem go, How close to God this spider must feel Weaving a world above the earth The string as thin as breath The breath so easily silenced A net of wings Fluttering toward blind quiet Before I could even finish, before anyone even had a chance to process the words coming out of my mouth, Edna just went, “Damn! This poetry n*gga’s gay as hell.” [tightly restrained seething] Fucking bitch. I oughta kill this stupid little bitch. [angrily muttering] I’ll punch you in the head, stupid bitch. Punch you dead in your fucking face. Kids break you. They break the person you thought you were going to be, and then we subsequently break them, and it becomes this ugly cycle of broken people. This is a great example of what I mean. Years ago, I read this article about a teacher in Idaho, right? Teacher in Idaho who got fired from his job, he got arrested, he got taken to jail, because he brought a puppy to school to show his class. Right? Seems harmless enough. He brought a puppy to the school. He showed the puppy to his students. And then afterwards, he fed that puppy to the class’s pet snapping turtle. [audience winces, groans] Everybody okay? I didn’t do it. I’m just a reporter. You understand? He fed a baby dog to a living dinosaur in front of children. And every article I read had the same reaction many of you are having. Every single one was like, “Oh my God.” “What kind of irreparable damage has this man done to these kids?” “What kind of permanent damage has he done to these poor kids?” And I kept reading those articles and thinking about my experience as a teacher. And I kept thinking, “Man…” “Fuck those kids.” “Fuck them.” What kind of permanent damage did those kids do to him? ‘Cause he wasn’t like that at the beginning of the year. He didn’t start off that way. That wasn’t written in the syllabus. They broke him! They broke his brain. They taunted him and they teased him and they took pictures of his paycheck and they posted it on the internet. Till one day he snapped, and he found himself holding a dog over this ravenous reptile staring out at 11-year-olds like… “Is this what you want?” “Are you not entertained?” “I swear to God, if one more of y’all brings up my divorce, I’ll kill this fucking dog.” “Today’s lesson is about minding your goddamn business.” “Turn to page 18.” Okay, this next selection from “Sunset Singles”… [laughter, applause] This next piece I want to share with you is a personal favorite. It’s a personal favorite. It’s a little number that I’ve simply entitled, “Sophisticated.” “Sophisticated.” We’ll play it for you now. [man] Hello, this is Joe calling. You have a very sophisticated voice… [haltingly] …as well as a very sophisticated… Oh… You must be a very sophisticated person. I’d love to meet up with you, if you’d like to have a drink. I’m a lawyer. Give me a call if you would at area code… [playback halts] Okay, first of all, first of all, can anyone hear definitively prove that that wasn’t Joe Biden? Can you definitively prove that that wasn’t America’s horniest president who’s trying to stutter his way into a little side malarkey, you know? Little malarkey on the side. And for those of you pulling back, because I do see some of you… You’re getting out… Yeah. You’re wondering, “Maybe this is too far.” Let me remind you. I’m trying to have sex with him. He’s not a victim in this situation. He’s a 138-year-old man who I’m trying to give some pussy. I’m a hero in this story. How do you make a good person? People say love. Love, you know, the thing that Flavor Flav and Brigitte Nielsen have. They say that’s how you make a good person. I don’t know if I believe in that. I don’t know if I still believe in love, honestly. I just found out that my wife thinks that I’m special needs. And yes, she means it in a derogatory way. She’s a bad lady. She should go to jail. Lock her up. The other day, she called me from work and she said this to me, verbatim. Verbatim, this is what she said to me. Now, keep in mind, I have changed some of the words to make me sound better and her sound worse. But verbatim, this is what she said to me. She called me up and she said, “Hey, I’m making chili tonight, and I need you to heat up a can of beans.” Then she said, and I’ll never forget it, “And whatever you do, don’t put the can in the microwave.” You understand? She told me, her emergency contact, not to put a can… And when she said that, I took a deep breath. You know? I took a deep breath, and I really thought about all the time we’ve spent together. The love that we’ve shared, the bond that we’ve built. I took a deep breath, and then finally, very calmly, I said… I said… I said, “Bitch, I’ll fucking kill you.” “I will kill you dead.” “I will take that gun that we bought after white people tried to take back the country from other white people, and I will shoot you in the leg.” “Is that what you think of me?” “That I’m metal-in-a-microwave stupid?” “You let me cum inside of you.” “You let that cum become a person.” “You leave me alone for hours, completely unsupervised, with that cum.” “Not to mention all those loose cans of beans.” And this whole time, she just been thinking, “Damn. I bet some day he gon’ kill himself with a microwave.” “I bet some day, he gon’ put a can of SpaghettiOs in the microwave, push the popcorn button, and blow his fucking face off.” “And then our daughter’s gonna have to grow up in a world where people refer to her dumbass daddy as ‘Orville Deadenbacher.'” It’s a long way for a pun. Some say too long. That’s critique I’ve heard. Too long. [cheering] Love. You want to talk about love? My mom… My mom has been married four times to four different men. Four. That’s a Jodeci’s worth of husbands. Some of y’all are white. That’s a 98 Degrees’ worth of husbands. For the older people, Jersey Boys. Four different husbands, and sometimes I think my mom’s the only person who’s truly figured love out. You know what I mean? She’s the only person who figured out what love is supposed to be. Because while the rest of us have potentially wasted our lives trying to find some perfect, special someone who may not even exist, instead my mom gets married every El Niño. She finds a new husband every other Toyotathon, and she just be having fun out there. She’ll marry anybody. Old-ass karate students. Grown men who order apple juice at restaurants. At one point, I’m not making this up, my mom married a disgraced NBA mascot. Yeah, that’s not a Mad Lib, that’s a choice she made. In front of God and the government. And all right, let’s just start from the beginning. I’ll walk you… You have questions, I have answers. First of all, did you know that NBA mascots could be disgraced? No? Even worse. Did you know these disgraced motherfuckers could fuck your mom? Apparently, it could happen to any of us. Apparently, none of our mothers can resist the sexual chemistry of a dishonorably discharged Benny the Bull. My mom married Benny the Bull. And not at his best. No! [applause] Don’t clap for that! Shame on you! It’s hurting my family! And the next question you’re naturally asking… You want to know how did he lose his job as Benny the Bull, right? How does one lose such a coveted position as Chicago mascot Benny the Bull? I’ll tell you. He was fired from his job as Benny the Bull because, and I’m not making this up, in 2004, he got caught selling drugs after a game in full costume. Just standing in the parking lot. Even the police walked up like, “Benny, what are you doing?” “Those are your work clothes!” He was arrested, he was banned from the stadium for life, and my personal favorite detail, they added his name to the Wikipedia page. When you go home tonight, look it up yourself. Go to wikipedia.org/Benny_the_Bull, and then, when you’re there, scroll down to a section entitled scandals. And there you will read about possibly the dumbest man for whom I’ve ever had to buy a Father’s Day card. Love. What is it even mean, to be a good person? You know what I mean? Given the state of the world, what does “good person” even really mean? All of our heroes are monsters, and all of our monsters have podcasts. What does good person even mean? I don’t… There is no good and bad. It’s not just good and bad. It’s not just right and wrong. It’s not just dark-skinned Sammy Sosa and Hello-Kitty-colored Sammy Sosa. There are so many different shades of Sammy Sosa in-between. My personal favorite, tapioca Sosa. Good and bad, that’s all bullshit. This is a great example. This is a perfect metaphor of what I’m trying to say. My favorite restaurant in the world, my absolute favorite restaurant in the world, is McDonald’s. [audience member whoops] How dare you. [audience laughs] Watch your goddamn mouth. I love McDonald’s. I don’t care what anybody says. I love it. It’s… I love everything about it. I like the food. I like the service. When people show me fight videos at McDonald’s, I root for the staff. Y’all don’t know how to act in a classy establishment. The manager has on a visor. Show some respect. I love McDonald’s. The other day, I’m at McDonald’s, and I order myself a 10-piece nugget. That’s my shit. Now, here’s where the story gets crazy. Because the woman behind the register, she winked at me. She winked at me. And then she gave me 12 nuggets. [audience member] Whoo! Come on. Some of y’all get it. Some of y’all know exactly what happened. For those of you that don’t, don’t worry, I’ll explain. Eleven nuggets is a mistake. Right? That’s a miscal… She ain’t go to college. That’s a miscalculation. That’s a miscalculation of the nugget. Eleven nuggets is a mistake. But 12 nuggets? She’s trying to fuck. Right? She’s trying to have sex with me for 12 nugget… The box doesn’t even close all the way. With 12 nuggets, it’s just sitting wide open, ready for me to come inside. Put some sauce on it. You know what sauce I’m talking about. It ain’t barbecue. It ain’t barbecue. And my wife doesn’t even like when I go to McDonald’s. She gets so upset. “Oh my God, McDonald’s? That stuff is terrible for you.” “They make their nuggets out of failed pregnancy tests.” She says wild shit. Evil shit about McDonald’s. And yet here I was, standing in front of a woman willing to give me more nuggets than I’ve ever experienced in my life. Just a utopia of nuggets in a bag. And I swear to God, in that moment, in that exact moment, it took everything in my being not to run away with the McDonald’s lady. Yeah, not to just run away and start a new life. Bro, we’d have a beautiful life. The McDonald’s lady isn’t going to make me read. The McDonald’s lady isn’t going to make me fold fitted sheets or vote during midterm elections. The McDonald’s lady is just going to give me nuggets. She’ll give me nuggets, then she’ll give me nasty McDonald’s sex. Gimme just that raw… It’s just sex and nuggets and sex and nuggets and sex and nuggets, till we both die at 48, happy. Just keel over and die from nugget poisoning, dead! And maybe, hear me out, y’all, maybe, maybe, that’s what we all should want. [audience member claps, cheers] Maybe that’s the dream. No, you’re right. Maybe that’s the dream we should all be chasing. Let’s be honest. The world is ending. It is. That’s not political slant. You don’t gotta agree with it. It is. Ice caps are melting. Bumblebees are dying. They added Black people to Jackass. We’re done. This grown Black man being like, “Kick me in the dick, Johnny Knoxville.” “I’ll try it!” We’re done. But here’s a ray of sunshine I offer you before we go home this evening. Here’s a little silver lining. The other day, I read an article about a woman who kept a box of Chicken McNuggets for six years. Six years, she kept the box. She’s single. Six years. She ain’t seeing nobody. She got all them nuggets everywhere. She kept this box of Chicken McNuggets, and on the day of that sixth year, the day that six years hit, she opened that box, she looked inside. You’ve already guessed it. Those nuggets were exactly as she left them. No change whatsoever. No mold. No crust. Them little things that be growing on Morgan Freeman’s face. [audience groans] Those old, little n*gga chocolate chips he got popping up everywhere. Nothing. And I read that article and I thought to myself, “Holy shit.” “Most marriages don’t make it six years.” Right? Most of our promises before God end well before these nuggets ever did. Maybe all of this is a fallacy. Maybe all these suggestions of eternity and everlasting are bullshit. Maybe we should just be eating what we want, and microwaving cans. And jerking off to the green M&M. Do you know what I mean? Just beating our meat to the green one, ’cause she got eyelashes and we like that. I don’t care if you take her boots away. She’s still got them eyelashes. Let me see them eyelashes! You know what I like. Maybe the only forever we can guarantee is Chicken McNuggets. Then I thought to myself, “Holy shit.” “I shoulda got my dick sucked by that McDonald’s lady.” Because maybe the preservatives in her mouth would’ve transferred onto my penis and made my nuggets last forever. And that, above everything else, would be the best thing that’s ever happened to me. [laughter, applause] And if you didn’t like that joke, just know that getting my dick sucked is a metaphor for finding true happiness beyond the broken expectations of a dying world. If you did like that joke, fuck yeah. [applause, cheering] This final selection from “Sunset Singles”… This final piece I wanna share with you this evening is untitled. There’s no title for this one, but I will say, it is by far the most haunting message that I have ever heard or received in my time on this planet Earth. Truly bone-chilling shit. That’s all you need to know. We’ll play it for you now. [man] Oh, you’re our… It’s good to be here. And I’m just here searching for that special one. If I don’t write you, I don’t like you. If I write you, then I like you. Let’s watch it grow slowly. Slow but steady. Hit me up if you think you like me. Let’s get familiar. So now y’all gotta go home with whatever that is. Thank you, Chicago. [applause, cheering] This was dope. Thank y’all for being here. Aw, you! Thank you.

              " 'devito': ['Dating Over 40 Is Like Thrift Store Shopping. Joe DeVito – Full Special Comedian Joe DeVito reflects on the challenges of being single at 50, particularly in the dating scene, where he compares it to shopping at TJ Maxx—full of odd sizes and last year’s styles. He jokes about the difficulties of aging, including unexpected injuries, frustrating visits to the doctor, and the absurdity of dating younger women. DeVito also shares amusing anecdotes about his elderly parents, technology mishaps, and his encounter with a friend’s baby born with an extra finger. Throughout, he highlights the humor in the inevitable struggles of growing older, making light of the quirks and inconveniences that come with age. * * * So, we get right into the personal stuff. I’m a single guy, and I just turned 50, which means I’m ready to cut a deal. Maybe you have a nut job sister-in-law you’re trying to shove off on someone. I’ll take a look. You know, whenever I say that, men laugh, and women go, “What about Carol?” Every woman has a specific nut job friend. I immediately think of their single guy friend. Carol’s due for release in a few weeks. What’s the range on her ankle monitor? Please, I don’t need help meeting crazy women. I’ve got that locked down. Trust me, I’m good. That’s my core demographic. But it is a strange age to be single at 50. I didn’t think that was going to happen to me, and it’s because dating is not designed for people my age. You don’t hear a lot about single guys my age because we’re gross, we’re creepy. I don’t want to hear about it either. I’d rather be up here talking about single women aged 25 to 30, but I can’t do that because they blocked me on Instagram. They shut me down. They said it’s weird. People say to me, “Oh, dating over 40, what’s that market like?” Market! Well, it ain’t Whole Foods. It’s not the freshest selection. I’ll tell you what it’s like shopping for a partner when you’re 50 years old. Have you been to TJ Maxx? That’s what it’s like. There’s a selection, but it’s a lot of last year’s styles, a lot of odd sizes. And even if you bring something home, you won’t know exactly what’s wrong until you’ve had it on you a couple of times. You’ll start looking for that receipt. “This is irregular. This is very irregular.” Young people have things I don’t have. They have time, they have energy, they have that other nonsense—hope. They’ve got a lot of hope going on. It’s true. It’s a strange situation to be in because I’m conserving my energy and my money. I don’t do dinner dates anymore. Dinner? Why am I feeding you? I don’t even know you! What am I, meals on wheels? This makes no sense. Women say, “Oh, you’re cheap.” And I say, “It’s not just that.” Because I’ve been around, and I know that women, when they know they have a dinner date coming up, they stop eating two weeks in advance to get their appetite up. Oh, the last time I went on a dinner date—what a nightmare. Talk about wasting a Groupon. This woman showed up ravenous like she got dropped off by the Donner Party. I’d never seen anything like it. She swallowed a steak in one bite, like a boa constrictor. I saw it moving down the side of her neck in one piece. She was there to eat, stuffing rolls in her dress, pouring ketchup in her purse. The dessert cart came by, and she shot out the tires so they couldn’t leave. Come on! That’s not classy, that’s not paleo. Women want that free meal, and I don’t do it. Sometimes I said to one woman, “Let’s meet for coffee,” and she said, “Coffee? You think you’re taking me on some kind of Starbucks date?” I said, “Starbucks? You wish. We’re going to meet at the bank. The coffee’s free, grab yourself a lollipop on the way out.” I had one woman, she was honest, she told me she was looking for a sugar daddy. I told her my wallet is hypoglycemic. No sugar in this recipe, sweetheart. I keep my bank balance sweet and low. I do have some financial issues. I just got a bill in the mail that said “Final Notice,” so that’s a relief. Took them long enough to get the hint. You can keep wasting postage all you want; I’ve moved on. So, take that, public library. I’ve tried using the dating technology again. It’s not for people my age; it’s for millennials and so forth. And I laugh when people say, “Well, you know, there are options for middle-aged people who want to meet online.” Okay, I’ve seen the commercials for Our Time. That’s what they call it—it’s the dating site for people over 50. It’s Our Time? No, no, our time was 1998. This is not our time; this is overtime. It’s with sudden death. It says, “Grab a chair before the music stops time.” As far as these profiles go, we need to pass some legislation about these pictures, okay? Some sort of time-date stamping—write your congressman! This is supposed to be a recent picture, yet I see the Hindenburg explosion in the background. Come on! And no Snapchat filters, okay? A woman’s got a crown of animated flowers and little hearts—what is she trying to distract me from with all of these fireworks going on in the back? Does she have some kind of weird mole, a goiter, a mustache? What’s happening here? No more of this. Look, it’s a dating site. There’s only one picture we need to see; it should be required for everyone, and that is you naked on a scale holding a bank statement. That’s it. Because people are dishonest, and I know it goes both ways. My female friends tell me that the men online lie about their height, which is hilarious because the whole point is to meet that woman. How do you show up eight inches shorter than you said you were? What’s the plan? You just keep moving around the whole night so she can’t get a read on how tall you are? It’s insane. And I say this as a short guy—I’m not trying to fool anyone, mislead you, or create optical illusions. I don’t put up pictures of me surrounded by chihuahuas, wearing a top hat and an umbrella. I’m honest, and I get punished because I tell women, “Look, I’m 50 and five foot six.” They think, “Yeah, he’s 73, he’s four feet tall. I’m not interested.” But it is tricky trying to find someone, especially when you’re getting older and strange things are happening to your body. It starts betraying you. When you’re younger, if you have an injury, there was an incident, something happened to cause this. You’re 20, you’re playing football, you twist your knee, you’ve got to stop playing football. Then in your 40s, the injury comes back—ah, the old football injury’s in town again. Then you turn 50 and you think, “I was watching someone play football,” and now there’s a bone sticking out of your thigh. You’re not sure what’s going on. And you can’t get help either. The doctors are useless. They used to give me prescriptions and routines. Now I go in and tell the doctor what’s wrong, and he repeats it back to me, and that’s the end of the session. Trust me, if you’re over 50, you come in and say, “Doc, I think I hurt my elbow.” “Oh yeah, you got a hurt elbow now.” Well, thanks for the second opinion, I guess. I get injured in ways I can’t even explain. I was running to catch a train, and I wasn’t in a real hurry, so I was doing that weird run where one leg is running, but the other leg’s just kind of hanging back a little bit, like, “I’m not in that much of a hurry, come on, you’re a team, work together, legs!” My other leg was like, “Take the next train.” So I get there, I step on the platform, and as soon as I lift my leg up—ah!—this horrible, shooting, terrible pain in my calf. I thought, “This feels serious; I better try and ignore it.” A couple of days later, I had to go to the emergency room. The doctor checks me out and he goes, “Well, you’ve ruptured your plantaris tendon.” I said, “Oh, do I need surgery?” “Nah, you don’t use it.” I said, “Well, excuse me, but you have no idea what I do with my plantaris tendon. What does it do?” “No, no, no, you don’t use it. It’s vestigial. It’s left over from when we used to walk on all fours. In fact, a lot of people don’t even have it anymore.” I thought, “How old am I getting? I’m rupturing tendons humans have evolved away from having.” I said, “Well, while we’re here, Doc, why don’t you snip off my tail and see if I can walk upright and maybe discover fire on the way to the parking lot?” There’s no way to prepare. I threw my back out. What was I doing? Climbing a mountain, wrestling an alligator? No, just putting in eye drops. I didn’t know I was living on the edge, tempting fate. I leaned back too far, my spine snapped shut like a mousetrap, Visine in a death grip, squirting all over my face. I thought, “I can’t move. Is this what the plantaris does? Does it help put in eye drops?” Do you understand what this means? This means I hurt myself while I was treating another medical condition. What kind of future awaits? Tear off a Band-Aid, and suddenly, “I can’t hear out of this side! What happened?” I’m trying to fight it. Even the good news is barely a compliment. Someone said to me the other day, “Hey, you look pretty good for 50.” Pretty good for 50? What’s the street value, the cash value of “pretty good”? Hey, you know, you look like a lousy 45. How do you feel about that? You know, you look like a 38 in some kind of sleep deprivation experiment.  It’s all adding up. Losing my hair, this is my haircut—this is my only option. This is the last stop before bald. We call this “sides and back.” Sides and back—ask for it by name. Sides and back. Top and front are taking care of themselves. If I want to thin this out, I just take a shower, and it washes right out. It’s sides and back. My barber has been cutting my hair for 10 years. Every time I come in, he says the same thing: “What are we doing this time?” What do you think we’re doing? “Oh, I’d like to try a French braid. How about one dreadlock, like a Slim Jim coming off the top here?” What kind of curveball am I going to throw? Sides and back, that’s all there is to be done. That’s my only option. I used to have choices. I used to get a mohawk every summer. If I got a mohawk now, it would look like a semicolon—chunk missing. I even had long hair—oh, my long hair. When I was in my 20s, I grew my hair down the middle of my back. Now, it grows from the middle of my back. It’s awful. I go to the beach, and it’s like My Little Pony is running around. But I don’t say any of this to my barber because my barber’s Russian. You don’t mess with Russian people. Toughest people on earth, no sense of humor. You ever have a Russian person tell you a joke? It’s just a scary story, then they laugh at the end. They give you a punchline like, “And in winter grandma die. Ahahahahah!” They always act like it’s a translation issue. “Nah, it’s much funnier in Russian. The whole village was killed.” That’s what happens. And I don’t know what it is for women, but for men, the big moment is the first time you get the electric ear and nose hair trimmer as a gift. As a gift! That means someone who loves you is saying, “Please, do something about that. You’re walking around with that tarantula hanging out of your nose. I can’t even look at you. Please!” It’s so embarrassing because you put it in your ear, and you hear it make contact, and you think, “What’s growing inside my head?” And I’m Italian—I’m very hairy. Is it normal to go through two or three batteries in one use, or is that too much? I had to put a leaf bag on it like a lawnmower. There’s just so much—they don’t have a mulch setting. It is scary, yeah. And I’m feeling it. I just went to visit my parents, and they’re older than me. My folks are at the age where any kind of technology—not interested. Anything could be a doorstop, tape dispenser—they don’t want to know. They’re not interested in learning. As soon as I get there, I pull into the driveway, and my father runs out: “You have to come look at the computer.” Because I’m under 70, so that makes me tech support. I tell them, “You use it three times a year; how bad can it be?” Then I go upstairs. “Oh, how long has smoke been coming out of the printer?” My dad’s main online activity is he and his retired friends email each other vacation photos in formats no one can open. No one has ever successfully viewed a single photo because they won’t update—they’re all running Windows 75. Nothing works anymore, and they get the notifications, so they think, “Oh, it’s a scam, it’s the Russians. Delete, delete, delete.” Now, I’m looking at an email. “Dad, I think this attachment is an eight-track. How did he do this?” Yeah, he cracks me up. And I have to say, if you’re a person who has parents who are senior citizens, next time you visit, have them drive you around a little bit. My father’s lost all conception of consistent pressure on the gas pedal. I don’t know if it’s perhaps a torn plantaris—it could be a plantaris issue. No more of this—what he does now is he floors it, and then he lets it all run out, and then he floors it again. His car looks like it’s skipping down the street. I’m sitting next to him, my neck hurts, I’m getting seasick. We were on the highway; he slowed down so much I thought he wanted me to get out. “He’s going to leave me here on the median?” But he still does the classic dad move, though. If the traffic stops short, the dad hand to the passenger eye, ear, nose, and throat area—just smacking you right in the face. Still doing it to his grown son. Because the windshield, the seatbelt—these things won’t save me, but his scrawny 75-year-old arm—a little karate chop to the throat—it’s not going to work. And I’ll tell you why: because his reaction time is slow. It’s a little off schedule. So whatever happened, he’s not kicking in for quite a while. And then, out of nowhere—”Hey, Dad, whoa, we’re sitting on the couch! What are you doing? We got home 15 minutes ago.” He’s making me nervous because he just had a little fender bender. I think it was his fault—he hit a parked car. It was parked in his driveway. And it was my car. Watched the whole thing happen through the living room window. I heard him revving up in the garage—I’d never seen him drive that fast—just bam! Eight feet, full speed, into the side of my car. And I ran. I said, “Oh wow, are you all right?” I couldn’t believe I had to ask this. I said, “Didn’t you see my car was there?” And he got mad at me. My father said, “Well, your car’s not usually there when I back out.” I said, “Hey, Dad, let’s not drive from memory. The world is changing; it’s changing all the time.” And my mother’s worse because my mother’s shrinking. That’s what happens to Italian people as we get older—we just keep getting smaller and smaller. I saw it happen to my grandparents—they turned into little Italian salt and pepper shakers. You could hold them; it’s like a Disney movie. So my mother is shrinking, and she drives looking through the steering wheel like she’s holding a hula hoop in her hands. That’s not safe. The other drivers don’t even know she’s in there—they just see the haunted Honda drifting through traffic. So here’s what I want to do: I want to get Mom one of those big wooden ship’s wheels—you know, the ones with the knobs—and that way, we can stick it in the middle of the dash, and she can drive standing up like a pirate. Let’s put a parrot on her shoulder. “Arrr, I’ll be going to the deli, who’s coming with me?” It’s good to visit with them, though. I forgot that my dad is one of the all-time great throat-clearers. Sounds like he’s got a big announcement coming up—a lot of that “ahem” we used to do when we were kids. Oh, we’d hear my dad in the bathroom every morning, tuning up. He’d like to start every morning with 20 minutes of this: [Makes exaggerated throat-clearing sounds] Like, you could tell he couldn’t get under it, so he had to come at it from different angles. You’d think, “What are you trying to knock loose at 8 o’clock in the morning? Did you swallow a pine cone overnight?” My sister and I would laugh; my mother would yell, “Don’t make fun of your father!” And then she’d yell at him, “Frank, stop it!” He couldn’t even defend himself yet. I wouldn’t have laughed if I knew it was hereditary. I got the gene. I got the throat-clearing gene. It’s terrifying. Oh man, and like I said, I’m trying to date—try dating younger women. That’s a mistake. Every man thinks he can get away with it because we’re so delusional. Every man thinks he’s just a bathrobe away from being Hugh Hefner. I tried going out on a date with a woman quite a bit younger than me, and I’ll give you some advice. If you’re on a date with someone who’s 20 years younger, when your food comes out, don’t take out your vitamins. Doesn’t look cool. And I have the tray with the compartments—she’d never seen it. She thought it was a harmonica. Now, I have to walk her through everything. “Well, these are my fish oil capsules, so I apologize if we’re kissing and there’s a weird burp. This is my glucosamine-chondroitin blend, which explains the crunching noise my knees made when we sat down. These three are stuck together, but I’m taking them anyway. And this is a dime I was about to swallow, so I’m glad we caught that in time.” I’m trying to stay healthy. I’m back at the gym. I am so sore right now. How long are you supposed to rest between workouts? Because it was six years. I felt like that should be enough time. I can’t recover! I can’t. And I know it. I went into my gym, and they put up these motivational posters to frighten you into having a good workout. And they put up a new one by the squat rack that said, “Go heavy or go home.” So I went heavy. Should’ve gone home. I went to do my squats—I went all the way down, and I remained there. I couldn’t get back up. I had to crawl out from under the bar. The guys at the gym saw me, and there are things you want to hear those guys say—things like, “You got it!” or “Nice work!” You don’t want to hear things like, “Are you okay, sir?” or “Do you need us to call someone?” or “Are you wearing a special bracelet, sir? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?” Of course, right next to me, some big gorilla in the next squat rack had 600 pounds on the bar. He looked at me and said, “Can you give me a spot?” I don’t like how you laughed at that already. I told him, “I don’t even think I could slow that down if something went wrong.” I said, “The best I can do is try and talk you out of it.” And I did. He went home. We actually left and got something to eat. But the way your body turns on you—man, I went to get my teeth cleaned. I thought I was going to be in and out in a couple of minutes, no problem. They wouldn’t let me leave. First, the dentist and her assistant—whatever they call them, their little henchwoman—they come in with this tray of tools like I’m in a muffler shop. She’s working in my mouth, poking and scraping and jabbing and sticking all these things in there. And then, when she’s done, she said, “I noticed a little bleeding in your gums. Have you noticed any bleeding recently?” I said, “How recently do you mean? Because everything was fine when I came in before you started stabbing me in the face with that little ice pick!” I have a tooth that’s moving around right up front. Anyone here under 40, you have that to look forward to. One day, a random tooth will say, “Oh, time to take a trip around your face!” Right there. The dentist saw that and said, “I noticed you have a little crowding.” That’s what she called it—crowding, like my face is a bus stop. “Notice you have a little crowding. Have you ever thought about braces?” “Yeah, I thought about them all the time when I had them! I was 12 years old!” “Well, you’re going to need braces again.” Again! Twice in one lifetime? No. I refuse to be balding and have a retainer at the same time. Braces? “Ooh, do they come with some acne and a Def Leppard T-shirt so I can relive the ’80s?” Her next question—I thought she was messing with me—straight-faced, the dentist said, “Do you grind your teeth when you’re asleep?” “Oh, I’ll have to check the overnight tooth cam.” So, I grind my teeth. The dentist said I need a mouth guard. If you don’t know what a mouth guard is, for a mere $800, they’ll make a custom-fit orthodontic device the size of a horseshoe, which I will cram into my face every evening to keep me from chewing on myself. And won’t that be a hit with the ladies? “I’m so glad you could spend the night. Just give me one moment here… [Mimics putting in a mouth guard] …so I don’t claw your eyes out while you have breakfast.” What woman wants to wake up next to Hannibal Lecter? I said, “I’m not spending $800 on a mouth guard. It would be cheaper to just put a wad of cash in my mouth every night and gnaw on that.” Then it occurred to me—I thought, “You know, I could probably find a better deal online.” And I did. I went to Amazon. Instead of one mouth guard for $800, I got a pack of 12 for $3.45. So, before I went to sleep, I put that flimsy, mail-order mouth guard in my mouth. And I don’t know if it worked because when I woke up, it was gone. I don’t know if I swallowed it, maybe it’s under the bed, I don’t know. And I don’t care. I got 11 more to go, baby. Amazon Prime’s free shipping—I’ll put the whole box in my mouth, I don’t care, I’m making money on this! Then the final insult—my dentist tells me I have acid reflux. My dentist! It turns out that at night, while I’m asleep, the stomach acid refluxes. I guess first it fluxes, and it thinks that’s pretty cool, and then it refluxes over and over. Thanks to the acid reflux, I’m eroding my teeth from the back. But the good news is, with the grinding, I’m eroding my teeth from the front. So, according to my dentist, within two years, I will have eaten and digested my entire head. By the year 2025, I’ll just be shoes with glasses—that’s all that’ll be left. I will have dissolved my entire body and slept through the whole thing. It sounds—I know the young people here, they can’t comprehend what I’m telling them, but it’s the truth. Listen, you look like you’re on a field trip. How old are you? 28? You’ve got two years left to do anything interesting. You want to do anything crazy, you’ve got to do it before you’re 30. So if you want to do any bungee jumping or getting out of a chair too fast, you’ve got to do that now, okay? They hate you so much. Thank you so much, you’re young. We could cut your arm off, and it would grow back like a starfish. You have no idea the power you have—it’s annoying. Anybody under 40 gives me their opinion, I say two words: “You’ll see.” Someone in their 20s—I can barely hear what you’re saying. I look at you, and all I see are stem cells. I can just melt you down and inject you into my ankle. Oh man. So, I still get a lot of pressure from my family to settle down. I feel bad—my poor father took me aside. He said, “You know, your mother and I really want grandkids.” And I said, “Well, then you’d better get cracking!” But the guilt trip is real. I went to visit my family, and my mother and father cornered me, yelling at me—I’m a grown man—and the two of them are freaking out: “Joseph, you need a plan! You don’t have any children! Who’s going to take care of you when you get old?” That’s when it hit me—they think I’m going to take care of them! Now, who needs a plan? I’d like to have kids one day, but just for the one day because they’re very annoying—constant demands: “Clothe me, feed me, let me sleep inside.” When does it end? But some people have cool kids. This is so awesome—a friend of mine just had a baby. The kid’s got an extra finger on one hand. I’m delighted, I’m so thrilled, and no one else wants to talk about it. It’s a friend of the family, and I found out because my mother left a voice message—a strange message: “Judy just had a beautiful baby girl, but she has six fingers on one hand. Don’t say anything.” Click. So I called back, and I said, “Well, the finger’s on the kid’s hand, right?” “Yeah, of course.” “Well, not if the finger’s coming out of her forehead! We’ve got some issues, right? Unless she has glasses—it’s kind of convenient, then.” See, I look on the bright side. I don’t mean to offend any unicorn people out here, but on the hand, it’s much better to have that extra finger. So I went to see the baby, and when I walked in, people took me aside and said, “Just don’t draw any attention to the extra finger.” And I said, “Yeah, that’s the only reason I’m here! You think I just come to see people’s babies? What are you, crazy?” I’m delighted! I say, “Get that kid a guitar. Think about it—this could be the next Eddie Van Halen right here. It’s extra—it’s bonus.” You’ve never heard that before—dun dun dun dun—wow! You’ll hear that and think, “Well, we’ve heard dun dun dun dun before, but dun dun dun dun—that’s a whole new sound. That’s a hit record right there. Keep it in there.” So I took those parents aside, and I said, “Listen, don’t listen to these other people, okay? No one’s going to make fun of your kid. You tell them it’s a blessing to have that beautiful, healthy, little six-fingered freaky baby there—that is a gift, okay? That is good luck. And I’ll tell you why—because that kid’s going to win every argument that starts with ‘first of all,’ because you don’t know she’s got one in the chamber. She’s got an extra—she’s got reinforcements. So you’ll make your big discussion and your argument and your points—you think you’ve got it all wrapped up, and then suddenly, out of nowhere, she hits you with, ‘And in conclusion…’ I think you win again, six-fingered baby.” You guys have been a delight. My name is Joe DeVito—thank you so much!'],\n",
              " 'rogan': ['Joe Rogan, performing live in San Antonio, expresses his love for Texas, recounts his move there, and makes humorous observations about Texas weed, Buc-ee’s gas stations, and aliens. He discusses COVID-19 skepticism, political and social commentary, and his experiences with controversy, including Fear Factor and vaccine misinformation. Rogan also shares his thoughts on societal changes, the complexities of language, and the absurdity of certain behaviors and beliefs. Throughout, he maintains a comedic, irreverent tone, engaging the audience with his unique blend of humor and provocative insights. * * * [announcer] And now, live from San Antonio, this is Joe Rogan. [audience cheering and applauding] What’s up? What’s happening? San Antonio! The world got weird, but we’re all together. [audience cheering and applauding] We’re all together. And I wouldn’t wanna be anywhere else but here in Texas. Fuck, yeah. [audience cheers] Fuck, yeah. Thanks for coming out, folks. Thank you very much, appreciate it. [audience cheers] This is my new home state. I’ve been living here for four years, I fucking love it. [audience cheers] I love it here. I’m never moving. The only adjustment I’ve ever had to make is Texas weed. [audience laughs] You think it’s the same. Texas weed is different. Because Texas weed is grown on Texas soil. [audience cheers] And I believe the soil has memories. [audience laughs] Because if you smoke too much Texas weed, like… [inhales] We gotta give this land back. [audience laughs] Dude, what the fuck did they do? [audience laughs] I heard that every Buc-ee’s is built on an Indian burial ground. [audience laughs] Yeah. [laughs] That might be misinformation. Don’t say you heard it from me. I am known for that shit. [audience laughs] Buc-ee’s is where I take all my friends from California. They’re like, “Why do you like Texas?” I take them right to Buc-ee’s. “Behold!” [audience cheers] Behold the kind of gas station possible in the land of the people who conquered the Comanche. If you’ve never been to Buc-ee’s, it’s like if you were in the middle of a cocaine binge and you decide to make the ultimate gas station. And you fucking did it. [audience laughs] You really did it. You got a pile of your dad’s oil money, like… [snorts] [man] Whoo! “I wanna sell kayaks!” [audience laughs] I want my gas station now, pickled alligator dicks and Chuck Norris action jeans. [man] Woo-hoo! [snorts] How come you can’t vote here? [audience laughs] If you could vote for Trump at Buc-ee’s, the aliens would land. They would go, “What the fuck are you people doing?” I’m very invested in aliens being real. If they’re not, I’m gonna feel so fucking stupid. I’ve had so many dumb conversations about them. The dumbest argument that aliens aren’t real, “If aliens are real, why don’t they land on the White House lawn?” Oh, when you go fishing, do you check in with the president of the lake? [audience laughs] No, you just trick those dummies with fake food and pull them up, take pictures of them, drop them back in the water, and they’re like, “What the fuck just happened?” [audience laughs and applauds] Exact same things the aliens do to us. I think aliens look at us the same way we look at Waffle House fights. [audience laughs] They just observe, like, “What the fuck is going on?” If you could come from another planet, you think you’d wanna talk to Biden? [audience laughs] Like, “Take me to your leader.” “I got hairy legs. My uncle got eaten by a cannibal. [audience laughs] Come on, man.” [audience cheering and applauding] I think… [laughs] I think if I was an alien, I would treat us the exact same way the aliens do. I wouldn’t give a fuck who’s in the Pentagon. I would find some dude cooking meth in Arkansas, and I’d teleport him up into the spaceship and explain to him telepathically that time is an illusion, even though you can measure it, and all humans are the product of accelerated evolution put here to give birth to A.I. Then I’d drop him back off in the woods. [audience laughs] And say, “Now go tell someone, bitch. [audience laughs] Go tell them how I touched your butt.” [audience laughs] What? What’s that all about? The alien anal probe, we all know. Why do we know that? Why is that always a part of the story? Because it makes the story more ridiculous. Makes people less likely to believe. I think they’re going, “What if somebody believes him? Put something in his ass. [audience laughs] Make him love it. Make him just jizz all over himself.” Just, “Oh, shit. Oh, God.” Imagine if you have your greatest orgasm on an operating table in a spaceship? “Oh, Jesus.” [audience laughs] You’re gonna leave that part out. [audience laughs] Your story’s always gonna seem suspect. People gonna go, “Is that all?” “That’s everything. The whole story.” [audience laughing] Maybe that’s how they get our DNA. That’s how they get cum out of donkeys. [audience laughs] I used to host Fear Factor, and, uh… [laughs] [audience cheering and applauding] And… Thank you very much. Thank you very much. [laughs] This is a true story. Fear Factor was canceled because we made people drink donkey cum. [audience groans] I’m the only guy in Hollywood that lost a job because people had to drink cum. [audience laughs] Usually, that’s how you get a job. [audience laughs] And look, first of all, wasn’t my idea. Okay? I just worked there. And the way Fear Factor would work, I would show up, they’d give me a script of what the contestants had to do. I would read it and go, “What the fuck?” [audience laughs] But on one day in particular, it said they were playing horseshoes to see who had to drink the most donkey cum. And I said words I never thought I’d say. “I don’t think you should make people drink cum on TV.” [audience laughs] When I’m the voice of reason, you’ve got a really fucked-up program. [audience laughs and applauds] And here’s the thing, they had buckets, like Home Depot buckets, of cum. And I’m like, “How did you get that?” [audience laughs] You can’t just have that. You gotta tell me how you sourced it, okay? You gotta be real clear right away. We got laws, okay? So I asked the handler, “How do you get it?” He goes, “You take a cattle prod and you stick it up the donkey’s ass and you shock his prostate, and they just bust.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Whoa, that is so fucked up.” Then I was like, “What does that feel like?” [audience laughs] Like, you don’t wanna know. Like, what if it’s your favorite thing? Like… [grunts] You can’t even tell anybody. If that was your favorite thing, you gotta keep that to yourself. No one is gonna understand. They ask you, “What’s the happiest day of your life? Birth of your child?” Like, “Eh. [audience laughs] That was pretty good. But one time, I got abducted by aliens. They stuck the finger of God up my ass, and I jizzed out of every cell in my body. And I been chasing that dragon ever since. [audience laughs] I’m on my rooftop every night with a flashlight going: ‘Come back. Come back. Come back’.” [audience cheers and applauds] If they’re real and they’re watching… If they were gonna come, they would have come during COVID. It’s good to see everybody having a good time. The country’s almost back to normal before World War III. [laughs] [audience laughs and cheers] COVID was just so strange. We lost a lot of people during COVID, and most of them are still alive. [audience laughs] Yeah. Right? [audience cheering and applauding] Right? There’s a lot of people that I don’t fuck with anymore. Before COVID, I would have told you vaccines are the most important invention in history. After COVID, I’m like, “I don’t think we went to the moon.” [audience laughs] I think Michelle Obama’s got a dick. I think Pizzagate is real. I think there’s directed-energy weapons in Antarctica. [audience cheering and applauding] [man] Oh! I’m just kidding. I’m just kidding. I don’t think Michelle Obama’s got a dick, but I believe all that other shit. [audience laughs] Here’s one thing we found out during COVID. How disgusting men are. Because here’s a pop quiz: how many ladies got fired because they got caught masturbating during Zoom calls? [audience laughs] Was there even one? Out of all the crazy bitches out there, not even one is like, “Show me your fucking spreadsheet.” Not even one? Not even one. [audience laughs] Dudes were dropping like flies. It was the number one reason why men in executive positions got fired. I just made that up, but doesn’t it make sense? [audience laughs] You believed me. It tracks. [audience whooping] Men are so gross you can’t even set up in front of a camera with a… With a computer with a webcam pointed at us without a guy thinking, “What does this camera see if I get down like this here? Keep a poker face. If this dog stops barking so I can keep my hard-on.” You’re on an election call, like, “January 6th, lock them up. Lock them all up.” [audience laughs] Here’s the thing about jerking off. Everybody does it, but if you get caught, you’re a fucking loser. [audience laughs and applauds] “You fucking loser.” And you feel it too. You’re like, “Oh, no, I can’t believe I got caught.” “Everyone knows. Everyone’s gonna know. Oh, no!” [sobs] I’ve only been caught once in my whole jerking-off career. But it was by my wife, and she was so upset. She goes, “I can’t believe you did it while I’m at home.” I’m like… [winces] “I do it while you’re sleeping right next to me.” I do it like this. I do tiny strokes just to not wake the master. I put a glass of water on the bed to make sure I’m not making any ripples. I like to live dangerous. I eat supermarket sushi. I don’t give a fuck. [audience laughs] [man] Whoo! [laughs] I like to take fake risks. I like to take edibles before I get on airplanes. [audience cheers] Listen. It’s a way to find out what really bothers you. [audience laughs] I don’t like to give advice. I don’t give a lot of advice. But I will say this. 200mg is the right dose. [audience laughs] Don’t do it. Don’t do it. But if you’re gonna do it, that’s the number. This is why. If you wanna know what’s in the basement, you gotta go down the stairs. [audience laughs] You gotta go look around. A lot of people are like, “I like to microdose. It makes food taste better, makes sex feel better.” Uh-uh. You gotta get to, “What are memories made out of?” You know? You gotta get to, “Maybe the universe is God.” [screams] You gotta get to that place. The airport is the best place to be high in public. This is why. Because no one notices. Because everyone’s acting weird. [audience laughs] No one acts normal at the airport. They’re all standing around, talking quiet. They’re all worried they’re gonna die. When you’re high, you blend right in. [audience laughs] And you don’t have to do any thinking. They tell you what to do. “Get in line.” I’m like, “Okay.” [audience laughs] “Walk up here.” [grunts] “Give me your ticket. Sit down. Don’t lean back.” “I won’t. I won’t.” Strap yourself into your chair. And every now and then, they come by with water. You’re like, “Whoa.” [yells] You’re going 500 miles an hour, 30,000 feet in the sky, thinking about people you fingered in high school, going… [audience laughs] And you don’t think you’re gonna make it. “I can’t keep doing this.” But you can. It’s like a near-death experience you always survive. [audience laughs] And all my friends that don’t like weed say the same thing. They’re like, “Dude, it makes me paranoid.” Right. [audience laughs] Right. But when it’s over… But when it’s over. Everyone in this room that has ever been too high, the moment it wears off, you’re like, “Ohhh. I’m gonna be a better person. [audience cheering and applauding] I’m gonna be nicer to people. I’m gonna hug more folks. Like, half these problems have to be my fault.” The only time it’s ever been a problem for me is if you have to answer questions to an official person. Like, I have TSA Pre, which I really recommend if you’re not a terrorist. It’s a solid deal. If you give the government money, they let you keep your shoes on. You’re like, “Ah, thank you, overlords. So kind.” And it’s a nice way to separate society. ‘Cause you’re in this quick-moving line. You get to pass those barefoot losers with their shitty paperwork. My laptop’s in my bag, motherfucker. You know? You feel trusted. But I didn’t know that, uh, they still have to touch you even if you have TSA Pre. It’s a number thing. It’s a random number thing. So I walk through the cancer machine, and this light goes off. [audience laughs] And this is exactly how this lady said this to me. She goes: [imitating woman] “You’ve been randomly selected for additional screening.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] And I’m so high, I don’t even know if this is real life. [audience laughs] And I’m like, “But I got the TSA Pre.” She goes: [imitating woman] “Oh, I know. It’s dumb as fuck. But it doesn’t take long, so why are we fighting?” [normal voice] “We’re not fighting. I don’t wanna fight.” [audience laughs] She goes, [imitating woman] “Good. Male assist.” [normal voice] I’m like, “Male assist? Did you just assume my gender?” [audience laughing] Listen. [audience cheering and applauding] [laughs] That is a new thing you can say. That’s a new thing you can say, no matter what you look like. If you say to a person, no matter what you look like, if you say: “Did you just assume my gender?” Most people don’t know what to do. [audience laughs] She knew what to do. She goes: [imitating woman] “I’m sorry. Are you a woman, motherfucker?” [audience laughs] [normal voice] And we both looked at each other and went, “Ahhhhhh!” I go, “Oh, you’re high too.” So I high-five this nice lady, and they bring a man who starts touching me while he’s asking me UFC questions. [audience laughs] It’s one of the weirdest moments of my life because, first of all, I’m ticklish and trying to act normal. I’m standing here, and this dude’s on his knee going, “You think Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz ever gonna fight again?” [audience laughs] [audience cheering and applauding] [laughs] And I’m trying to act normal. “I hope so, bro. That’ll be a good fight, solid fight.” Then he hits me with this. If you’ve ever been randomly selected, this is what they do. He goes, “I’ll run the back of my hand against your crotch.” [audience laughs] Remember, I’m really high. [audience laughs] So I’m like, “Why are you gonna use the back of your hand?” [audience laughing and applauding] Is that the best way to do it? Hey, man, is that for you or for me? Because for me, it still feels like you’re touching my dick. You’re just doing it in this weird, dismissive way. Just… [grunts] It’s just a rude way to touch a dick. It’s like… [grunts] “Are you a terrorist? I’ll be the judge. [grunting] Nope. Just another dude whose dick I made feel weird.” I mean… [audience laughs] How many terrorists have they stopped with that? Is it zero or is it negative numbers? You disrespectful motherfucker. The back of your hand might be the worst way to figure out something. You ain’t getting no good data. [audience laughs] Why you touching dicks like that? [audience laughs] I tell you why, folks, because it’s our government’s solution to a complex problem. Which is, “How do you touch dicks and not be gay?” [audience laughs] [laughs] They’re like, “Got it. We’re gonna use the back of our hand. It’s no countsies.” [audience laughs and cheers] “Does it work?” “Yeah, try it on me, I can’t even cum. Come on, bro.” [audience laughs] Just jokes, folks, no one’s getting hurt. [audience laughs] I opened up a comedy club in Austin, Texas, a year and a half ago. Thank you very much. [audience cheering and applauding] When the world got crazy, I had to move to the Land of the Free. I love it. But one of the weird things about owning a comedy club is other people’s reactions. Fox News had the dumbest reaction. They’re like, “Joe Rogan created an anti-woke comedy club.” [woman] Yeah! I’m like, “Oh, you mean a comedy club?” [audience laughs] Like a regular one? That’s like saying I got a meat-eating steakhouse. You don’t have to use all those words. I get why young people wanna be woke, but I can’t do it, because I come from a different era, okay? [audience cheering] I was born In 1967, and when I was a boy, you could be Hitler for Halloween. Nobody cared. I never did it, but you could do It. Show up at your Jewish friend’s house, I’m like, “Aw, look at the little fuhrer.” Give a little tousle of your hair. Throw a candy in your bag. They knew you weren’t really Hitler. Like, he’s dead, and you’re 4. This is ridiculous. [audience laughs] And I get why the young people wanna be woke. I really do. Old people have fucked up the world. Let’s try communism. I get it. You don’t know any better. I get it. You’re young, I get it. And also, people desperately wanna be on a team. We’re tribal. There’s only two teams in this country, the left and the right. You know, you don’t wanna be independent. You don’t wanna be that weird dude telling everybody that gold Is the only legitimate currency and all tax is theft. [audience whooping and applauding] [man] Yeah! That’s me. [audience laughs] If you get me drunk, I will be annoying. I will tell some shit you already know. So I understand why people wanna be on a team. So you just try to find a team that aligns with your values, right? What does your team believe? “We believe that healthcare is a basic human right.” I agree. “We think that education should be free.” Me too. “And men can get pregnant.” Fuck! [audience laughs] Is that a package deal? How did that one slip through? [audience laughs] That wasn’t… All of a sudden, it’s an emoji on your phone. You probably don’t even know that you have that. If you’re a heterosexual man… And I know there’s a few of us left. [audience laughs] [audience whooping and applauding] You know… You know how when you type things, Apple gives you an emoji as a suggestion. If your friend’s, like, “Hey, you want to go out Saturday?” You text back, “I can’t. I’m trying to get my wife pregnant, man.” And you look down at your phone, and you’re like, “Is that Bert Kreischer?” [audience laughs] “What is that?” It’s a pregnant man. Oh, finally! Finally, there’s a pregnant man emoji. Representation. Finally, I could write, “eggplant, splash of water, pregnant man.” Finally. You ever see the regular man emoji? He looks like the guy Tiger King fucks in prison. [groans] Just listless and… The pregnant man looks robust, like Charles Bronson with a baby inside him. Like, “I’m the fucking future.” [audience laughs] It’s just new language, okay? I’m trying to learn your new language. I’m willing to say men get pregnant. I’m willing to say “pregnant men.” I just don’t think it’s a good… I think you need extra words. How many men can get pregnant? Not a lot, right? Is there anything different about the ones who can? Maybe we should use extra words, like we do with other stuff, like off-road vehicle. [audience laughs] It’s still a vehicle, but it can do some extra shit. [audience laughs] If you’re a dude and you can have babies, that seems really new. I’m not trying to be offensive. The last person I want mad at me is a pregnant man. [audience laughs and applauds] Do you have any idea how unreasonably confident they would be? You’ve got a full beard and you’re breastfeeding a baby, going, “I am in defiance of God!” [audience laughs] Big old thick neck and hairy tits. And the baby sucking on that nipple going, “Where the fuck is my mom? [imitating baby breastfeeding] [audience laughs] And why does this taste like jet fuel?” [audience laughs] I wanna know what’s going on. The world got weird. And here’s my take. I just wanna be real clear. I believe in trans people. I think the world is strange, nature is strange. Nature can throw you a curveball, and you believe you’re in the wrong body. And I fully support your right as an adult to do whatever you want that makes you happy. I believe in freedom, and I believe in love. [audience cheering and applauding] But I also believe in crazy people. And here’s the thing. That somehow or another, that got left out of the equation. All of a sudden, crazy people just went away, like the flu during COVID. Like, ah. It just got absorbed in the numbers. Suddenly, every man in a dress is stunning and brave. It’s like… Trans women are women. How about most? How about almost all? You gotta leave room for crazy. Plus, I’m sorry… I’m sorry if it’s taken me a while to adjust, but all my life, if there was a movie about a killer, he was way crazier if he wore a dress. [audience laughs] Psycho. He dresses like his mom. Stabs ladies in the shower. Silence of the Lambs. It puts the lotion in the basket. [audience laughs] Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf was dressed like a fucking lady. [audience cheering and applauding] I’m not prejudiced. I like to look at men in dresses like I look at everything else, on an individual basis. Mrs. Doubtfire seems like a lovely human, all right? I’m open-minded. I wanna know what happened. It’s almost like a pervert wizard waved a spell on the whole world. “With a wave of this wand, you can walk to the women’s locker room with a hard cock, and anybody who complains is a Nazi. Abracadabra.” And it just worked. And everyone just accepts this new reality. It’s fucking weird. I just think we need standards. You can’t just put lipstick on and shit in the women’s room. We need some kind of standard. [audience cheering and applauding] [laughs] Oh, my God. All of a sudden it’s a hate rally. I was watching a Roe v. Wade protest where there’s a dude in a dress. It’s a women’s reproductive rights protest, and there’s a guy in a dress with a hairy chest and a five o’clock shadow, and he’s screaming in a cop’s face, “Keep your laws out of my pussy!” [audience laughs] And no one there was like, “What the fuck?” [audience laughs] Everyone was like: [imitating woman] “Yeah, stay out of her pussy!” [normal voice] Oh, my God, we’re in Narnia. What is this? That’s a guy! First of all, that’s probably not even a trans person. That’s probably a Republican. [audience laughs] That’s probably an agent provocateur sent in to discredit your organization with ridiculous behavior. Look. [audience cheers and applauds] Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago. Listen. Listen, he’s right about a lot of… He was wrong about that one thing, though. But he’s right… The wrong thing was a big one. But he’s right… That one thing was huge. But he’s often correct. And I’m just saying. If you have a beard and a vagina, you’re a human escape room, okay? I… I don’t have time for puzzles. I’m just trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and how it got everywhere so quick. It’s in prison. In California, there’s 47 biological males that are housed in women’s prisons. A lot of them are sex offenders, but that’s not important. What’s really important is gender. Wouldn’t you think that out of all the places that would be suspicious, that maybe you would be lying? [audience laughs] Fucking jail. Wouldn’t that be at the top of the list? Imagine a woman, “I’m gonna go to prison, but at least I’m gonna be with other women.” You see R. Kelly with a wig on. You’re like, “Fuck.” [audience laughing and cheering] [groans] [audience whistling and applauding] I don’t know what happened. I think it’s China. [audience laughs] I’m only half kidding. I think they got us with TikTok. [audience laughs] I really do. I think they’re just really clever. They’ve been around for 4000… America’s the shit, but we’re real young. We’ve been around 250 years. Who knows if we’re gonna make it. China’s been here for 4000 years. They’ve invented everything. They invented paper, alcohol, gunpowder, rockets, noodles, Kung Fu, and TikTok. [audience laughs] Yeah, and Coronavirus. And I was… [audience laughing] I was… Hey, don’t be racist. China. I loved it when Trump would say “China.” [audience laughs] They also invent our phones. The craziest thing. That’s supposed to be our enemy, and they make our phones. Do you know how dumb that is? We let the enemy make our phones. We can’t make a phone. There’s 330 million Americans, plus Mexicans, and no one can make a phone? [audience laughs] “What’s the real number?” “Who cares, are you racist?” “I’m not racist. Let them vote. Give them money.” What’s going on? I don’t think we should have open borders. But maybe some of those folks sneaking in can make a phone. [audience laughs] I mean, some of them have to be valuable. These are ambitious people. If I lived in Guatemala, I’d fucking walk here too. If you can get across the Rio Grande River with a balloon filled with fentanyl stuffed in your ass… [audience laughs] …that’s the type of dude who can get shit done, okay? That guy will come through in a pinch, okay? He’s not gonna form a union. He doesn’t even know what the fuck “overtime” means. [audience laughs] I’ll trade him for everybody who has blue hair. “Fuck you, go back. Go there.” Let’s make America great again. [audience cheering] [laughs] Oh, this is the silliest show ever. I love it. Thanks for being here. You guys are awesome. This is fun. [audience cheering and applauding] [clears throat] I really am worried about China. I really am. [woman shouting] What are you yelling out? Go ahead, yell. You’re on TV. What are you saying? [man 1] Hey! [man 2] What about the Cobalt… Cobalt mine. Oh, congratulations, you know a thing. This fucking idiot. [mockingly] What about nuclear power plants? What about renewable energy? [normal voice] What a good time to yell that on live TV, fucking dipshit. [audience cheering and applauding] Imagine your whole life, “I’m gonna say something meaningful. It’s gonna make an impact. Cobalt mines.” [audience laughs] China does that too. You’re right. They buy our farmland all around military bases. We’re like, “Oh, it’s okay.” The craziest thing they’ve ever done. This is the craziest thing they’ve ever done. There’s a thing called The Bodies Exhibit. Do you know what that is? [man whoops] How many of you have been to The Bodies Exhibit? [audience whoops] [laughs] Okay. If you haven’t been, The Bodies Exhibit is a science museum. It’s a science museum exhibit of dead human beings. They take dead people, skin them, leave their dicks on, give them fake eyeballs and have them posed like doing sports. They’re throwing a javelin, playing poker. It’s the weirdest shit. But somehow or another, it’s okay, because it’s in a museum. If that same scene was in a serial killer’s basement… [audience laughs] If a cop went into a serial killer’s basement and found dead people playing sports, it’d be the front page of every newspaper. Like, what the fuck was that guy doing? Right? But it’s at the museum. And you’re like, “The windows are big. It’s cool.” [audience laughs] I went three times. You should go too. You can’t bring those people back. The last time we were there, we were like, “Why does everybody look Asian?” And we were like, “Where did they get these bodies?” So we Googled it. And you should too. ‘Cause the answer we got is, “Chinese unclaimed bodies which may include political prisoners.” [audience gasps] “May.” When the fuck do you ever get to use the word “may”… [audience laughs] …when people ask you where you got the dead people. What the fuck? Now I’m in the rabbit hole. You know how that goes. “What’s a Chinese unclaimed body?” We Google that. It’s any body left unclaimed for 30 days. Now here’s the problem. This process where they have to turn you into a statue after you’re dead, it has to take place within 48 hours of death. [audience laughs] Thirty days, 48 hours. I’m fucking terrible at math, but I can do that one. How did you guys not do this math? I’m in the museum, like, “This is a fucking murder exhibit.” And part of me is, like, “This is terrible.” And the other part of me is like, “How gangster are the Chinese?” This is… [audience laughs] That has gotta be the fucking coolest way to get rid of somebody. Can you imagine some Chinese diplomat comes home, and he catches the tennis instructor in bed with his wife, like: [Asian voice] “Oh, so you enjoy tennis. [audience laughs] Well, now you can play tennis forever!” [normal voice] And he could just go to the museum and visit this dude. Any time he wants. [Asian voice] “Oh, Mr. Big Dick, how’s your game? [audience laughs] You look a little sluggish. I’ll see you tomorrow. Ha-ha. [audience laughs] Ha-ha, motherfucker.” [normal voice] Everybody kills people in other countries, but they don’t turn you into a statue. That’s wild shit. You know, they do it to a lot of people there. You gotta mind your P’s and Q’s in China. You get disrespectful in a business meeting, next thing you know, you’re on a bike at the museum. [Asian voice] “Oh, look, there’s Harry with all his big criticisms about our infrastructure. [audience laughs] Look at you now, Harry. Riding a bike like a fucking asshole with your dick hanging out.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] I just wanna say, I admire what they’ve done. I’m not just saying that so I hope they don’t kill me. [audience laughs] I really hope they don’t. But if they did, it would be a funny way for me to die. If I went missing, then four months later there’s a short guy at the museum with a microphone. [Asian voice] “Oh, Mr. Funny Man, where’s your fucked-up accent now? [audience laughs] Go back to Fear Factor. Oh, you can’t. Ha-ha. Ha-ha, motherfucker.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] That would be a funny way for me to die. The funniest way for me to die is if I die from Covid. [audience laughing] Don’t think I didn’t think it! When I got Covid, the first thought I had was, “You better not die. I talked so much shit. I talked so much shit.” If I died from Covid, the memes would never end. [audience laughs] It would be me with two X’s for eyes holding a can of horse paste. “Apparently, fear was a factor.” [audience laughs] It would be funny. I would be laughing. I would be on my deathbed going, [laughs] “Fuck. Oh, no. Oh, no. Why didn’t you trust the science?” [audience laughs] [man] Whoo! Why didn’t I trust the science? [audience applauds] Thank you. Nobody likes a science denier. By that, I mean, dudes who believe in squirting. [audience laughs] Like, “Hey, man, they’ve done the research. It’s pee.” “No, dude. I’m telling you, it’s not pee.” “Dude, it’s pee. What are the odds that it’s a mystery fluid that comes out of an undiscovered organ and squirts out the pee hole? Like, hey, at least the Earth looks flat. I can see how you get confused.” [audience laughs] “It looks like pee, it smells like pee, it’s pee.” “Dude, it’s not pee.” “I’m telling you, she’s got a Stanley filled with sweet tea, she drinks it all day and she’s fucking lazy. She doesn’t wanna get up, she’s peeing on you, and you’re a fucking idiot.” [audience laughing and applauding] “You gotta believe the science. Trust us.” I heard that so often during the fucking pandemic. “Why don’t you trust the science?” I got canceled so often during COVID that sometimes I would find out by accident. [audience laughs] This is a true story. One time, I just woke up, I’m in my underwear, I plopped down in front of the TV, I turn it on. The moment I turn it on, Prince Harry’s talking shit about me. I’m like… [gasps] I just woke up. I’m vulnerable. I’m in my underwear, and there’s a prince on TV. Do you know how fucking weird it is when a prince knows your name? He’s like, [British voice] “Joe Rogan’s giving out dangerous vaccine misinformation.” [audience laughs] And my first thought was, “Fuck, did I? [audience laughs] I might have.” [audience laughs] But here’s my take on that, sincerely. If you’re getting your vaccine advice from me… is that really my fault? [audience laughs] Like, who are we protecting? Who’s out there going, “You know that dude who made people eat animal dicks on TV?” “How’s he feel about medicine?” Like… That’s not my job, kids. I’m a professional shit talker, okay? Some of the things I say make sense, a lot of them don’t. It’s up to you to figure out what’s what. That’s the fun part. Problem is, people say, “People listen to you and take your advice.” Well, take this advice: don’t take my advice. It’s the best advice. Don’t take my advice about 200 milligrams, and don’t take my advice about Covid. [audience cheers] Because when my wife had Covid, I fucked her twice. I wish I was lying. It was before any cure. I was following her from seven feet away, like, “You don’t look that sick.” [audience laughs] This is a real conversation we had. She said, “You are gonna catch it.” I go, “No, I’m gonna hold my breath. I can hold my breath for four minutes, let’s fucking go! Let’s fucking go.” I know why people got upset, I got it all. And I’m not even mad at Harry. If I was him, I would have said the same shit, I get it. If I met that dude, I’d love to have a drink with him. I genuinely think most people are good people. I think if you approach them with good intentions, have a good conversation… If I met that dude, I’d be like, “I’m not mad at you. In fact, I think if I lived your life, I would be you, and I think if you lived my life, you would be me. I think we’re all one. Let’s have a drink, relax. Have cocktails, have a good time.” Like most of us, right? [audience cheering] And the goal… The goal would be to get him about three drinks deep. And then go, “Hey, man, you ever do mushrooms?” [audience laughs] [British voice] “I heard they give you brain damage.” [normal voice] “No, that’s government propaganda. Listen… whatever you eat, I’ll eat double. Come on. Let’s go meet the aliens.” Could you imagine doing mushrooms with Prince Harry? Imagine if you could trick that guy into doing mushrooms with you? If you see him chew it and swallow it, you’re like, “Oh, it’s gonna happen.” There’s a moment when you do mushrooms, like 20 minutes after you swallow it… where you know you can’t throw it up anymore. [audience laughs] You know that moment? You’re like, “Oh no, it’s gonna happen.” Can you imagine that moment? You’re sitting criss-cross applesauce, just staring eye to eye with the prince, waiting. [audience cheering] And here’s the thing about mushrooms. Mushrooms take about 40 minutes to kick in… but about 35 minutes in, you hear them coming. [audience laughs] Right? Yeah. You hear footsteps in the distance like… [imitating slow footsteps] [takes a deep breath] [loud, droning hum] [audience cheering and applauding] And while Prince Harry’s tripping balls… I’m gonna hover over him and go, “Are you sure vaccines are safe? [audience laughs] Bitch, you’re not a scientist.” It was a weird time for me, Covid. I got in so much trouble. One thing they would do that was sneaky, is that whenever people were mad at me, they would take things that I’ve said drunk, high as fuck… and they would just put it in quotes. Like it’s a well thought-out statement. As if I’m standing in front of a judge, going: “Your Honor, I believe that lesbians lack the proper lower-back muscles to fuck a woman correctly.” [audience laughs] That was a real quote in an article about what a piece of shit I am. [audience laughs] And I read it, and I was like, “First of all, it’s true.” [audience laughs] I wish it wasn’t. I wish it wasn’t. But also, you can’t just put that by itself. Because I didn’t say it by itself. I wouldn’t just declare that. Like what a rude, shitty thing to say for no reason. I only said that as part of a conversation that I didn’t wanna have. Ever have one of those? You’re talking and somebody interrupts. I was at a bar with a friend in New York, we were drinking, having a good time, and there was this particularly aggressive lesbian lady at the bar, Which genuinely, I’m a fan of. I like wild people. She looked like Tom Arnold, had a Patagonia vest on. You know the type. [audience laughs] She was doing shots with her girlfriend. They were talking shit. [imitating woman] “Fuck, yeah, bitch!” [normal voice] Doing shots and kissing. Atmosphere! Fun! Yay! It was fun. But then she kept talking to us. Me and my friend are talking. She goes, “Sorry, boys, she only likes girls. And I got my own dick!” And I’m like, well, now we’re in a conversation. [audience laughs] Right? So I go, “Where is it?” And she said, “It’s a strap-on.” And I said, “Having a strap-on and thinking it’s a dick is like having a lighter and thinking you’re a dragon.” [audience laughs and cheers] “Plus, everyone knows that lesbians lack the proper lower-back muscles to fuck a woman correctly.” That’s the only time I would ever say that. It would have to be those words in that order, and I feel like if they put all that in that article, people would read it and go, “I see his point. [audience laughs] Yeah. They were just talking shit and she got out of pocket. That’s all it is.” Instead, they try to use that quote as proof that I’m homophobic. And I’m like, oh my God, there is so much better proof. You guys are lazy. Like, that’s all you dug up? First of all, it’s not true. But if you wanna take me out of context, I give you a lot to work with, you know? [audience laughs] For the record, I’m not even remotely homophobic. I’m the opposite. I wish I was gay. It looks way easier. You’re hanging out with only guys? No one can get pregnant? No more lies? I wish! And if I was gay, I get to use that F-word again. Oh, how I miss it so. [audience laughs and cheers] Oh, how I miss it so! Tony Hinchcliffe can still say it, but you know why. [audience groans] I used to throw that word around like a beach ball at a concert. Just, “Whee!” It was a fun word. Made conversations more festive. It was fun. And rarely did it have anything to do with gay men. But they took it just like they took the fucking rainbow, all right? [audience cheers] Because they’re men, and they’re greedy. They’ll tell you, “You shouldn’t wanna say that word. You say that word, you’re a homophobic piece of shit.” Or you’re calling your friend to wish him a happy birthday. [audience laughs] What about the fun way? There’s no gay people on this phone call unless the government’s gay, because you know they listen. There’s only one problem with that word, and that problem is that there are people in the world, although there’s less than there’s ever been, thankfully, there are people in the world that hate gay men. But nobody hates gay women, and that’s why you can say dyke. [audience laughs] You can say dyke at work, they’re like, “I’ll look out for her.” Nobody cares. Nobody even fake gets mad. Nobody hates gay women. In fact, men don’t even think they’re real. [audience laughs] Women believe in gay men. If a woman sees two hot guys kiss, she’s like, “They’re gay.” A guy sees two women kiss, he’s like, “Pfft. They think they’re gay. But that’s just ’cause they ain’t got a piece of this sweet dick, kid!” [audience laughs] Every man that has ever lived… you give him three drinks, he thinks he can fix a lesbian. Like, “Dude, I’m the one, I’m fucking Highlander. I got the tools. I can fix her.” And also, for whatever reason, men don’t seem to care if girls have done gay stuff. Again, I’m just a journalist, and I report what I see in the field… and I’ve noticed if you’re talking to men, and they’re being honest… Gentlemen in this room, I want you to imagine, you’re on a date with a woman and she’s the one. If you get lucky, you will find the one. But sometimes you’re not with the one, it doesn’t seem like it’s gonna happen. One bad relationship after another, you’re so frustrated, am I ever gonna find someone I fucking love? And then finally, you’re on a date with the perfect person. She’s so fucking cool, you’re drinking margaritas, you’re imagining having a family together. And she’s like: [imitating woman] “In the interest of full disclosure… I just want you to know that for the last 10 years I was in a relationship with a woman.” [man whoops] [normal voice] And you’re like, “Low miles, whoo!” [audience laughs] You call your friends up, “Dude, it’s like a barn find! Yeah, it’s like a ’69 Mustang that was under a tarp. [audience laughs] A lady had it. Yeah, she took it out every couple days and licked it. Look at all the rubber on those tires. Look at the suspension.” [laughs] I don’t know why men think that way, but I know some women get very angry. This lady waited for me after a show to lecture me. She waited for me, she’s like: [imitating woman] “You don’t care if the woman does gay things if you don’t care about the woman.” I’m like, “Okay, Socrates.” Like, what? Why don’t you write that shit down on rocks so people in the future can read it, you fucking imbecile. I hate dumb people that are confident, you know? Also wrong. I hate dumb people that are wrong and confident. Because she’s wrong. Like, I love my wife more than anyone I’ve ever met in my life. She is my favorite person. [audience cheers] Thank you. But… [audience laughs] If I came home tonight and was like, “Hey, baby, how was your night?” She’s like: [imitating woman] “Fucking Melissa tricked me into licking her pussy.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] I’d be like, “Well… don’t do that a lot.” [audience laughs] I’ll be walking that fine line between creepy and supportive. Like, “If that happens again, make sure I’m there in case that bitch goes crazy.” [audience laughs] [laughs] No women think that way. Zero. No women think that way. People say there’s no difference between men and women, it’s just cultural. [grunts] That seems like… No women think that way. I don’t care how open-minded you are. I don’t care how progressive you are. If you’re a heterosexual married woman… [imitating woman] and you’re at home just reading a book… waiting for my man… [normal voice] And he comes to the door: “You are not gonna fucking believe what happened. [audience laughs] [exhales deeply] [imitating woman] “What? What happened?” [normal voice] “Mike tricked me into sucking his dick again.” [audience laughs] [imitating woman] “How does this keep happening?” [normal voice] “I don’t know, it’s crazy.” [imitating woman] “Okay, what is going on, are you gay?” [normal voice] “No. Mike is just really tricky.” [audience laughs] They’re gonna say that’s a homophobic joke. And I’m gonna say how? Because the gay guy wins. That dumb straight guy keeps sucking his dick. That’s a W for the gays. They wanna tell you you can’t make jokes about them. If you want equal love, you have to have equal jokes. Because that’s how we find out if you’re annoying. [audience cheers] Yeah. If we can’t joke around about you, we know you take yourself too seriously. They’re trying to say they’re hateful, it’s hateful. Listen, I don’t hate anybody. I love everyone. And I love gay men. But I think about gay men the same way I think about mountain lions. I’m happy they’re real, but I don’t wanna be surrounded by them. [audience laughs] They’re dudes who fuck dudes. I don’t like my chances, okay? They’re not unicorns, they’re just men who fuck men. And every man who’s ever lived is a shifty cum salesman, okay? All of them, 100%. Especially the ones who say they’re not. Every man who’s ever lived is a foreman of a small, 24-hour sperm factory with a shaky agreement with the union. You got one warehouse, that’s your balls. One delivery truck, that’s your dick, and packages are constantly stacking up. And you’re like, “Hey, we gotta get this product out of here!” [audience laughs] And if your product sucks, you become a male feminist. And these are the facts. [audience cheers] That’s what it is. And some of these guys are trying to get rid of gay jizz. It’s normal. [man cheers] They just got the gay gene. I love them. I love everybody. You can’t control your genes. Obviously, it’s a gene thing. You know, we can’t… Like, you ever done a gene test? I did one of those. I found out I’m 57% more Neanderthal than regular people. [audience laughs] Yeah, I’m fucking handicapped. Yeah, Europeans killed my people too, where the fuck’s my casino? Huh? [audience laughs] I want my cave back! That was a big number. I showed my wife. “I told you this wasn’t regular stupid.” [audience laughs] But she had a really good point. She goes: “But all people came from cave people, right?” Which is a fucked-up thing to think, that everyone in this room is here because somewhere in our ancestry, someone had sex before they figured out doors. That was a long time! Thousands and thousands of years, no doors. Just wild monkey people trying to run away from cats. This thing we’re doing right now, this is so recent. Civilized society where a bunch of cool people can hang out together, we don’t know each other, have a wonderful time, drink cocktails. This is so recent. [audience cheers] But there’s such a thin veneer on this society. That’s why you have those thoughts. You know those thoughts? “I can’t believe I’m thinking that, I would never do that.” How about this? I know you have this thought. When you’re in your car and the light turns green but the scooters keep coming? [audience laughs] And you just wanna go to jail! I wanna see masks fly off, and backpacks. “Fuck you for feeling safe!” You know those thoughts? You don’t do it, but you know those thoughts? How about this? You ever be in line at Starbucks, and there’s a cop in front of you, and he’s not paying attention? [audience laughs] And you’re like, “I think I can take his gun. I’m gonna hit him now and John Wick the fuck out of this room.” You don’t do it, but you think it. That’s why we need homeowners associations, IRS payments, student loans, credit card debt. We gotta be distracted. We can’t keep society going with those thoughts. I have my most fucked-up thoughts talking to really smart people. Because I can’t keep up, so I just start thinking my own things. [audience laughs] “I bet they’re not thinking this.” Because, like, I’m friends with Elon Musk, which is the intellectual equivalent of a boy and his dog. [audience cheers and applauds] He’s so much smarter. You know when you’re around your dog, he’s like, “You’re different. tell me what to do.” That’s me. I’m like, “When they land, you’ll tell them I’m cool?” [Rogan and audience laugh] I was having a conversation with that guy where he was explaining to me how this rocket ship his company designed is gonna move civilization to Mars and about how we have to become a multiplanetary species to survive natural disasters, and it’s a six-month journey in this rocket. He’s telling me all the calculations, and halfway through him explaining this, I stop paying attention. And while he’s talking, all I’m imagining… I’m imagining four dudes strapped into a rocket, on their way to Mars. [imitates rocket] One guy pulls out a gun. Boom! Shoots that guy. Bang! Shoots that guy. Boom! Blows his own brains out. Leaves one guy alive going: [screams] Flying all the way to Mars, strapped in next to three dead dudes. I don’t know why I was thinking that. I wish I was paying attention. I’m talking to the smartest guy alive, and I’m thinking, “Should I tell him? [audience laughs] I should probably tell him my idea. He doesn’t know you can get a gun up your ass.” I had a whole backstory. That guy had an affair with that guy’s wife and tricked him to go to Mars. Yeah, he’s not… Elon’s not thinking these things. He’s… If evolution’s real, that guy’s ahead of us. I don’t know if evolution’s real. I’ve done zero research. I always say I think it’s real, because if you don’t, people are mean. But it’s a terrible story. Like, if a moron told you the story of evolution, you’d be like, “What happened?” “Once upon a time, giant lizards ruled the Earth, then a rock came from the sky and killed them. Then a little shrew just kept doing its best. And one day it became a person.” [audience laughs] I thought, “Yeah, fuck that story, I’m sticking with Jesus.” [audience cheers] That story sucks a fat dick, son. Because even if you’re right, you have no incentive. If we all go to darkness, I think I’m going to heaven. I sleep like a baby. You’re on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. You’re a fucking idiot for not believing in dumb shit. You sleep better. Look, I believe in evolution. I just don’t think all the monkeys crossed the finish line at the exact same time. [audience laughs] I have a feeling there’s probably some trial and error. You know? And I have a feeling somewhere in my ancestry, someone was like, “Fuck it. One more time with a monkey.” [audience laughs] Probably late in the game too, like at the buzzer. If you know, evolution probably took a long-ass time. Not like one day we woke up and we were people. It was thousands of years, a lot of gray area. And if you know human men, there had to be a moment in history where a group of guys had to pull their buddy aside and go: “Hey, man, you gotta stop fucking monkeys.” [audience laughs] “Dude, she’s cool.” [audience laughs] “She does sign language.” Like, “Sign language?” You look over, the monkey’s going like this: [audience laughs] “Man, I don’t think that counts. I don’t think that’s real sign language.” [laughs] [sighs] [men hollering] Genes are so weird… Thank you. Genes are weird because people are proud of them, but didn’t do shit to earn them. But we’re all guilty of it. If you do a DNA test and find out you got some cool stuff in there. Like, I found out I have 1.6% African in my DNA. [audience cheers] Thank you! It’s all dick! It’s not a big number. That’s not my point. Here’s my point. 1.6% is not a lot of African. I don’t know what percentage African you have to be where you can freely say the N-word. [audience laughs] But from my personal experience, I will tell you that 1.6% appears to be insufficient. [audience laughs] The juice is not worth the squeeze, kids. Yeah, nobody gives a fuck about context. So I don’t say the N-word, but I definitely have, and… I would lie to you, but there’s a lot of evidence. Like… [audience laughs] I never said it to be racist, because I’m not racist. But if I was gonna quote a great Richard Pryor bit, I wouldn’t fuck it up by saying “the N-word.” I’d just say the actual word. I thought everybody would understand. But then somebody made a compilation of every time I ever said that word over the last 15 years, and they made a YouTube video, and it turns out that looks racist as fuck! [audience laughs] Even to me! I’m me, and I’m watching me, and I’m going, “Stop saying it! You’re not allowed to say it!” I put my cursor over the video, I’m like, “Four more minutes?” [audience laughs] “Oh, my God, I gotta move to Florida. I gotta live with the swamp people now! Because I said me a magic word.” Here’s the thing about these words, you can’t say them. But that’s unfortunate. Because words are just supposed to be a sound you make so I know what you’re thinking. I can’t wait until we can read minds. Because a lot of people out there say, “Have a nice day”, and they want you to get AIDS. [audience laughs] Okay? I don’t think the sound you make with your face is our big problem. And I don’t think we should ban words, because some of them are fun to say. Here’s my suggestion. I think you should pay money to use the most offensive words then that money goes to cancer research. I think we can fix cancer. Here’s my thought. Every time you renew your car registration, you can buy five “retard” tags. [audience laughs] Imagine if that’s all it took. Imagine if retard tags cured cancer. How would CNN even report on it? [audience laughs] But you know, a lot of people will tell you: “Hey, you should never say that word.” And you know what? I agree. You should never say that word sometimes. [audience laughs] Right? Sometimes. Like, if you’re a good person… If you’re talking to a child with a developmental disorder, you would never dream of using that word, right? But if you’re talking to a regular grown man who made a documentary about the world being flat? [audience laughs] Yeah, he doesn’t have extra chromosomes. He’s fucking retarded. [audience cheers] And if you don’t say it that way, he doesn’t know how you really feel. And he doesn’t get the feedback we all need to learn and grow. A lot of people say, “You’re a hypocrite. You’ll say the R-word, but you won’t say the N-word?” Yeah! [audience laughs] Because I’m more afraid of Black people than I am retards. [audience laughs] Duh. Don’t you know how jokes work, faggot? [audience laughs] It’s all just supposed to be funsies. Words are for fun, kids. Try explaining that. “Why did you laugh at that?” You go to work tomorrow, “It was really funny.” [audience laughs] The problem isn’t words, folks. The problem is phones. We have these complaint boxes we carry around with us. We’re constantly checking in to see what the most complain-y people think about everything. And it’s not a lot of people. And it’s affecting culture. This is what most people don’t know. Ninety percent of all tweets are made by 10% of the people. And those people are 100% retarded. [audience laughs] It’s phones! It’s being connected to everywhere. And it’s weird. We’re weirdly connected. Like, I never leave my house without my phone. I leave my kids at home all the time. [audience laughs] I love my kids way more than I love my phone, but I will let certain people watch my kids, you know? Like my wife’s mom, she’s an amazing grandmother. Never trust that bitch on my phone. Like, “Hey, get out of there, Nana! That’s my real brain.” Can you imagine unlocking your phone, giving it to your wife’s mom, going “I’ll be back in an hour”? [audience laughs] Look, I’m a good guy, but I say a lot of shit to my friends that I don’t really mean but I think it’s funny. I don’t wanna have to explain that to a 75-year-old lady. [imitating woman] “Look, read it. He says he’s gonna kill you and fuck me. [audience laughs] He sent that to all his friends. And they all thumbs-upped. Look at all the thumbs up, these fucking psychopaths. Oh, and there’s a lot of pictures of other guys’ dicks on his phone. Do you know about those?” [normal voice] I send my wife pictures of other dudes’ dicks just to see if she’s paying attention. [audience laughs] If you wanna find out if you got a good jewel, you gotta bring them a fake diamond. You gotta stay crafty or these hoes get bored. Every day’s a fucking game! [audience laughs] No, not really. “What, really?” No. My wife’s mom is a lovely lady. She’s 75 years old and single. So I said to my wife, “Why don’t we take her to one of those nice places where there’s guys her age.” She goes, “No. They all go crazy and they get STDs.” She has an article saved, an article about a rash of STDs at nursing homes. I’m reading it, I go, “Okay, this is the difference between you and me. Because if there was a place where I could take my grandpa and he would definitely get herpes? I would fill that old dude up with so much viagra that he goes deaf. I’d give him a couple extra twists of his mustache and push him toward those old hoes. “Let’s go, Grandpa!” I’d be in that parking lot with a conch shell. [imitates horn] Every man wants his grandfather to be the savage of the nursing home. You go to visit grandpa, he’s got an army helmet on, open bathrobe, bottle of Jack, big old hard-on, blacked-out naked old ladies in his room. He’s like, “I fuck, and I wait for the Lord!” [audience applauds] [laughs] I’m glad you guys laughed because my wife didn’t think any of the shit I just said was funny. She’s like, “Don’t write it down.” I’m like, “You’re too close to this, baby.” She goes, “Who wants to have sex with a 75-year-old woman?” I’m like, “A 102-year-old man.” He’d be pumped. “She’s a good one. She was born after the war. They had better food.” He survived ‘Nam, let him fuck! “This is bullshit. You don’t mean it. You don’t want that for your grandfather.” That’s what he wanted. He told me. He told me! I’m not guessing. I was very close with my grandfather. I got drunk with my grandpa before he died. I go, “Grandpa, how do you wanna die?” He goes, “I want a Russian nurse riding the old shlazool, with her hands on my neck, and right when I’m about to nut, I wanna look her in the eye and go, ‘Fuck you, and fuck Stalin.’ [imitates choking] [audience laughs and applauds] And bam! I had a great life.” I will never forget that day because I was 6 years old. [audience laughs] San Antonio, I love you to death! Thank you very much, this was a lot of fun! [audience cheers and applauds] We did it! We did it! This was the first time I’ve done anything like this live, it was fun! I can only do it because you people are so fucking cool! Thank you very much! Thanks for coming out! Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, brother. Thank you. Thank you! [rock music plays] Thank you! Thank you, guys, thank you! Thank you. Thank you, guys. Let’s fucking go. Let’s fucking go! Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. We’re a part of each other’s lives forever. Thank you!

              " 'berner': ['[audience cheering] [announcer] Gigglers, are you ready? Please welcome Hannah Berner! [audience cheering] [“Sonata Slay” by Chris B. Harris playing] [audience continues cheering] What the fuck is up, Philadelphia?! [cheering] You little hoagie hoes, sit down! Oh, okay, church. [laughs] I do have to address, there was absolutely no need to do the worm there. I don’t know… I don’t know why I did it, but it happened. [audience cheering] [Hannah] Thank you. You guys, I just turned 30. [audience cheering] Twenty-nine months ago. And I feel good. But society tries to scare the shit out of you when you turn 30. They’re like, if you’re not fucking your face with a jade roller. If you’re not snorting lines of collagen. If you’re not doing Pilates, which is BDSM. If you’re not putting snail mucin, snail ejaculate all over your face. By the time you turn 30, they make you feel like you’re just gonna become… Joe Biden. I’m just kidding. Women can’t be president. That would be insane. And commercials are so cruel. Commercials are like, “Do you have a fine line?” “Eww.” “Do you have a gray hair?” “Disgusting.” “Men are never gonna notice you ever again.” And I’m like, “That sounds… so peaceful.” Just to be able to walk home at night without a worry in the world? [audience cheering] I can’t wait till I’m the age that I’m just unkidnappable. How fucking freeing. But you know what’s crazy. I’m 32. [audience cheering] Thank you. And I’ve never been kidnapped once. And that’s when you have to ask yourself, “Am I fucking ugly?” I’m not ugly, but I do have issues. I do have issues. I have depression. [audience cheers] I have anxiety. [audience cheers] [laughs] I have chronic fatigue. Any chronic fatigue girlies? [audience cheering] You do not have chronic fatigue. She’s like, “Yeah!” No, I went to the doctor, and I was like, “I don’t feel good.” “I don’t feel motivated. What’s wrong with me?” And he goes, “You haven’t drank water since 1994.” And he’s so fucking right. I hate water. I think it’s disgusting. He said I have to get an emotional support water bottle. Girls nowadays, they don’t want a boyfriend. They just want a Stanley. But I think it’s a conspiracy that I have to drink so much water. You know, like, male conspiracy theories is 9/11, the election, the clit. [audience laughs] It’s girl conspiracy theories that we need to drink gallons of water. What’s a gallon? That’s made up. Also, we look like pilgrims with pails. Walking around, it’s like, “You work from home, Stephanie.” “You’re not walking the Oregon Trail.” [laughing] Does anyone drink black coffee? [woman shouts] Yeah, you like to get choked. Anyone drink Mountain Dew? [woman exclaims] I can see her glowing in the dark. That is liquid Chernobyl. What are you doing? Does anyone drink Diet Coke? [audience cheering] You guys are all not okay. And no one’s talking about it. Girls are running around like… [screeching] My friend has six Diet Cokes a day. And I’m like, “Look, I’m not a doctor.” “But I don’t think that’s good for you.” And she’s like, “What? There’s no sugar.” “There’s no calories.” And I’m like, “Then what the fuck is in it?” ‘Cause heroin doesn’t have sugar or calories, and that’s not great for you. I’m not saying Diet Coke is heroin, but I’ve never seen them in the same room together. I wish the most essential liquid was an espresso martini. [audience cheers] Whoo-hoo! ‘Cause it’s a triple threat, right? It gets you drunk. It gets you hyper, and you will have diarrhea at the end of the night. You are light as a feather on the dance floor. You’re like, “Ooh! Ooh-ooh-ooh!” [woman 2] $60 here. You had a $60 espresso martini? [woman 2] Thirty each. Thirty each. [woman 2] So we spent $60. Plus, the wage gap. I’m fucking fuming. [laughing] The girl in front was like, “Look at my receipt.” She’s like, “Can I write this off?” What’s your name? Isis. Isis? Is it spelled the way we are afraid it’s spelled? But this was… Was this pre? She was before? So they copied her. That’s like Hannah Montana and me. I was first. Yeah. Wait. Isis copied your brand. That’s embarrassing for them. Get your own fucking brand. Do you… Do you have a nickname? No? That’s horrible. [audience laughs] So someone will just be like, “Isis is coming,” and they’re like, “What?” Her middle name is Persephone. Her middle name is Persephone? [woman 3] Persephone. [hesitates] Like Stephanie with a purr in the beginning? Purr-Stephanie. [woman 3] Persephone. What white trash shit is going on right now? [laughing] That was good. That was good. That was really good. You’ll see it on Netflix. That was funny. [laughing] [sighs] Oh, guys. There’s no easy way to segue this. But I’ve been really into politics lately. [laughing] Now, look, regard… Thank you, one person. Regardless what you believe in, we all can agree it’s been a little messy. The last 200 years. And I think we need a fresh perspective. And I think I can bring that perspective. [audience cheers] I like the group over here that’s like, “Let’s wait to see what she says.” [laughs] Actually, you’re right. I don’t know anything about politics, but I know how to do research. I went on TikTok. [audience cheering] And I figured it out, but I went to the hot topics, okay? I went to abortion. Do you know some people believe that you should never have an abortion under any circumstances, even if you’re bloated. And the next one I obviously went to was guns. Do you know some people believe that guns don’t kill people, people kill people? I have one edit. Guns don’t kill people. Men kill people. [chuckles] [audience cheers] And I’m not coming for the men. I would never come for you. It’s just a fact. 90% of mass shootings, your boys. And the 2% who were women had a very legitimate reason for what we did. [audience cheering] [laughing] The men are shaking. They’re scared now. They’re like, “Get me the fuck out.” Did you ever see the woman who chopped her husband’s dick off? [audience cheering] What did we all think? We all went, “What did he do?” So this is the thing, people want guns. Fine. I just think we need a little more gun safety, and then if I do the girl math, legally, the only people allowed to have guns should be the girls. [cheering] We ride at dawn! [audience cheers] He’s so scared. His hand is like… ‘Cause this is the thing, when men snap, they shoot stuff. When a woman truly, truly, truly snaps, she gets bangs. And that’s an assault on ourselves. No one else is hurt. It grows out in six months. You’re good, babe. Also, like if I had a gun, I would lose it in my room. [audience laughs] Every five minutes, I’d be like, “Where the… Where the fuck did I…?” “I was holding it all day. Where did I put my…” “Can someone call my gun? Where the fuck did I put my gun?” You get your gun. You’re with your girls. You’re going out, and you’re like, “What purse are you wearing with your gun?” Then you go outside. You’re holding your purse and your gun and Starbucks and keys and tampons. You’re like, “You’re not shooting anyone. You can barely hold anything.” Your nails are like… clap if you have long nails. Yeah, you can barely clap. You’re not shooting up a mall. [audience chuckles] And then you get in the Uber to go to the bar, and the girls come out. And you’re like, “Guns! We got our guns.” And then you’re like, “Oh, shoot! I forgot my gun in the Uber.” You’re like, “Hold on.” You’re like, “It’s me again.” “I left my light baby blue Hailey Bieber Rhode Peptide revolver.” Collab. Revolver is actually the only gun that I know. And a musket. Imagine a bunch of hot girls with muskets. Like, “Hold on, my musket.” [thudding] The musket keeps queefing. [grunts] No, you guys, I thought this shit was so funny. Thought it was so funny, so I posted it online. And some people were not happy with me. No, no, no. One guy was like, “It’s not the shooter’s fault.” “It’s the girl’s fault.” “They’re not giving enough blowjobs.” But I’m listening. I’m learning. I said, “I hear you. I see you. New law!” “If you can’t get a blowjob, you can’t get a gun.” [cheering] If you really want a gun, you have to go to the blowjob shop. You have to bring a girl to vouch for you. And I’m in charge, okay? But then one guy was, like, mad mad. He was like, “It’s not the shooter’s fault.” “It’s the mom’s fault.” “She didn’t raise him right.” And I was like, “You are so right.” “She didn’t raise the shooter right.” “She should have had an abortion.” [audience cheering and applauding] Thank you. What a polite abortion clap. [cheering] I’m gonna say something controversial ’cause you guys are fun. Yeah! Sex is not consistently as good as society makes it seem. [audience cheering, shouting] [women] Yeah! But I’m not talking about the lesbians. ‘Cause the lesbians, they’re coming. Okay, they’re coming. They’re coming. Are there any lesbians in the crowd? [cheering] They all just came. [laughs] I had to ask my friend who’s a lesbian, I said, “How do you know when the sex is done?” [woman 4] You don’t! [audience cheering] ‘Cause with a dude, you fucking know, okay? ‘Cause he’ll be like, “Ooh!” I’m like, “What dribbled out of your dick that you can’t speak for four weeks?” “What happened?” To my, uh, loud lesbian correspondent. How do you actually know when it’s done? Carpal tunnel? Battery dies? I love that she’s standing up. She’s like, “This is my moment.” How do you know when it’s done? [woman 5] You get very, very tired. You get very tired. All the straight girls are like, “What is going on?” [laughs] She’s like, “You’ve orgasmed so much that your body is empty.” “And then you just go up to heaven. That’s how you know when it’s done.” “Then you communicate with her afterwards about your feelings. It’s crazy.” I’ll tell you, sexuality is not a choice. That’s how you know. [laughing] We need realistic sex in movies. That’s where we get confused. It’s so unrealistic, these scenes. It’s always the same scene too. It’s two people. They bust down the door, right? They just start going at it. They’re making out. They’re breaking shit. The guy will, like, kick over a lamp. And I’m like, “Don’t touch my home decor.” [laughing] And then the guy always picks the girl up, right? Why does he pick her up like that? And he, like, puts her on the counter. [grunts] It’s like, “First of all, this is a studio apartment.” “My bed is right here.” “Also, don’t put me on my counter.” “My counter’s disgusting.” “Forks, soy sauce, ketchup, Con Ed bills, Invisalign.” “I don’t want my own teeth marks on my back.” Also, then you know, when the P goes in the V in the movies. [sighs] There should be a nuance, right? Like, there’s an angle. It’s hard to just, like, go in, right? In movies, the guy will just unzip his jeans, look over here and go… [grunts] And she’s like… [squeals] And I’m like, “The guy who wrote this movie has never had sex before.” I want realistic sex in movies, you guys. [laughs] [audience cheers] For example, I queef all the time. And I’ve never heard one queef in a movie. Zero queef representation in movies. [audience cheering] Thank you. Also, when I say I’m queefing, I’m farting. [audience laughs] But I’m telling him it’s a queef. ‘Cause men have absolutely no clue what a queef is. If it doesn’t smell, you’re Gucci. Get out of there. You got away with it. Also, when I say I’m squirting, I’m peeing. One more note about queefs. Stop saying that I queefed. You queefed me, okay? And I know that for a fact because I’ve never queefed alone. [laughs] You took your needle dick, and you started pumping me with air like a basketball. Sorry you didn’t realize my pussy was so fucking tight that the air was gonna get trapped, and you didn’t anticipate that. But don’t gaslight me and tell me that I queefed when I know for a fact I laid there and did absolutely nothing. [cheering] Doggy’s crazy. No, I like doggy because you can text. [laughing] But you kind of leave it up to him. Like, he needs to figure it out. And that’s when he always, like, accidentally hits the wrong hole. And you have to go, “No.” But he’s pretending like he’s in a dark elevator, clicking every button. Good thing our buttholes have the reflexes of a ninja. And they’re like… [shouts] [laughing] We need realistic sex in movies. Like, you know when you’re riding a guy. Now, ladies, when you’re riding a guy, don’t worry about what’s going on over here. You focus on him. He has 17 chins. He’s going through an exorcism. What, when you lean over, you have a couple rolls? Men can’t tell when you cut your hair eight inches, okay? You do you. [audience cheering] But you know when you’re riding a guy… and you kind of lose your rhythm? We were like, “Okay, we’re a team.” “Let’s get this back. Five, six, seven, eight.” “And one and two and three and four.” You know when you’re trying to go like this? But someone gets off, and next thing you know, you’re just going like this? And then he hasn’t been in you for four minutes, and you’re just like… My favorite part though is when you come up and his dick falls out a little? And then you snap it like a glow stick. It hurts. It’s scary. Men, you need to speak up. Stop suffering in silence. It’s happening everywhere, okay? It’s happening everywhere. What are dicks made out of? You have no idea. [woman 6] Disappointment. Disappointment. That’s hilarious. What are dicks made out of, babe? [man] Collagen. Collagen? Honestly, men will say stuff so confidently that I’m like, “Collagen.” “He’s right. He’s right.” You know, actually, I don’t care. But I don’t wanna snap his dick, but it’s always so funny ’cause they always make that noise, you know? ‘Cause they’re scared. I’m scared. We’re all scared. And he always goes… [gasps] Then I’m like, “You queefed.” I queefed you. I queefed. [laughs] I queefed. [laughing] Anyone ever lost their virginity? [audience cheering] Sluts, a bunch of sluts. I actually lost it once. And it was fucked up. It’s fine that it was fucked up, but no one warns you. Society is like, “Oh, my God. It’s this beautiful coming of age.” “You become a woman.” And then a guy with a shrimp dick rips open your hymen. There’s blood everywhere, and he goes, “Did you come?” And I’m like, “Unless that’s come, I have no clue what just went down.” And orgasming is hard. Like, for a woman to orgasm, for me specifically to orgasm… She’s like, “Yeah. What are you gonna say?” My legs have to be perfectly straight. I have to have zero work emails on my phone. And I need to be alone. Thank you. [audience cheering] She’s independent. But shout out to my vibrator. She does great work. [audience cheering] They’re souped up. The technology nowadays, you can storm a capitol with one of them. And actually get the job done. Also, the kids are choking now. Someone goes, “What?” She is. And this is my thing with choking. How am I gonna come while I’m also fighting for my life, you know? I understand some people want pain during sex, but if you wanna hurt me during sex, just look me in the eye and say, “I’m disappointed in you.” There are some men in the crowd, which I don’t love. No, I’m fine with men being in the crowd as long as they have a chaperone. Where’s your chaperone, sir? Good. What’s your name? [man 2] Eric. Eric with a C or K? C. Thank God. I would have had you kicked out. I like you at the… at the end. What’s your name, sir? [man 3] Kevin. Kevin. With a K? Interesting. Oh, he’s coming. [laughing] So what I love about Kevin, you have a beard, a mustache, glasses, and a hat. Are you in Witness Protection? What did you do? Nothing. [Hannah] Nothing. That’s what someone who did something would say. I’ll follow up with you later. Who’s single? [audience cheering] We know Isis is single. Can you imagine the dating apps? Like, what the…? He’s like, “Who’s outside?” She’s like, “Isis!” [audience laughs] But you’re single? [woman 7] Yes. You’re single. Are you on the apps? [woman 7] I am. Yes. Which apps? Hinge and Bumble. [Hannah] Hinge and Bumble. It’s a scary place. [Hannah] It’s a scary place. No, it is. Hinge is crazy. ‘Cause Hinge, it asks questions. You can see people’s personalities. And I like when guys, like, brag on not-braggy questions. You know, when they’re like, “What’s your hobby?” and he goes, “I’m a jet-setter.” “I travel the globe.” “Don’t hit me up unless you wanna see the world.” I’m like, “Brad, you went to Panama City Beach once during spring break.” “Shut the fuck up.” I have really bad taste in men, but it was never my fault. And it was never their fault. It was Disney’s fault. Disney teaches you to be attracted to the douchiest, most narcissistic guys. It’s never the nice guy. It’s the guy coming in on a horse with a stupid hairdo, like a prince. Doesn’t shut up. Actually, name a Disney prince in the front. You can yell it out, and I’ll tell you why he’s the worst. [woman 8] Eric! Prince Eric wanted to fuck a fish. Next. [woman 9] Aladdin! Okay, Aladdin was hot. [laughs] Don’t love the illegal pet monkey, but he did pull off purple. But Aladdin was kind of like that guy on Hinge. He was like, “Jasmin, I’m gonna show you the world on my magic carpet.” He showed her a four-block radius, lied to her face. Sandoval, honestly. Who’s another prince? [shouting] Oh, Hercules has ED. Um… Raising awareness. Prince Charming. Okay, Prince Charming. Who nicknames themself Prince Charming? What a little douche. Then he throws a party with all the women in the kingdom, right, for himself. Does a beeline for the girl who’s so blackout, she lost her shoe. Tells her he loves her that night. Next morning, can’t find her when she doesn’t have makeup on. He’s like, “Where’d she go? I don’t recognize her.” Then takes her shoe and puts it on every single girl’s foot in the kingdom. Go on WikiFeet like a normal person with a foot fetish, okay? Leave these women alone! Who else? [women shouting] Okay, Simba. You guys, don’t turn on me. Simba was a fuckboy. Simba was such a fuckboy. First of all, Nala’s his cousin. And he kept, like, hitting on her, and finally, she was like, “Okay, Simba, like, I like you.” And he’s like, “Whoa. I need to focus on my career becoming king because my dad fucked me up. Mm.” Who else? Gaston’s obvious. That’s your fault if you fell for Gaston. [woman 10] Shrek! Shrek! Who… Shrek. [laughs] Look, Shrek is ugly hot. I would… sit on his face. [laughs] Who else? [audience shouting] Flynn Rider sounds like a lacrosse player who did give me chlamydia. [laughing] John Smith was a colonizer. Oh, you guys got tight on that? That’s crazy. [woman 11] Captain Hook! Captain Hook. Why do I just get turned on? He just has a rabbit attached to his hand. [laughing] I’ll end with the Beast. I’ll end with the Beast. I’m a Beast apologist. I’m a Beast apologist. They try to make the Beast like he’s this disgusting, horrible monster. The Beast is 6’4″. Pulls off capris. Looks like Travis Kelce. He’s a homeowner with a mansion and a library. That’s old money. That’s “fuck you” money. I know some of you guys are like, “Hannah.” “He was super controlling.” “He never let her leave the house.” That’s my literal dream. To never leave a mansion and have gay utensils getting me food the entire time! [cheering] Hi, zaddy in the blue. There’s a beautiful bald man right here. Is that your man? Is that your man? I’m so jealous of bald men. It is so shimmery and beautiful, like a… like a baby dolphin, okay? I’m so jealous of bald men, ’cause why can’t my pussy be that smooth? It’s ingrowns. I needed a Weedwacker to get here. I’m half-Italian, okay? And it’s not fair. It’s not fair. ‘Cause when men are hairy, you know, it’s fine. You know, they call ’em bears. You know what they call girls who are hairy? Single. And it’s not cool. It’s not feminist. Where’d you two meet? [woman 12] It’s my dad. Oh, it’s your dad. [laughing] Ladies. [laughing] [audience cheering] [laughing] Perfect segue. I actually got married, you guys. I got married. [audience cheering] It’s super off-brand for me. I got married, but it’s to an older man. [audience cheering] A zaddy, if you will. And I love an older man. I love an older man. Because they are so tired. They’re exhausted. They’re not chasing women on the street. They’re on the verge of arthritis. You get in a fight with them, five minutes in, they’re like, “Yeah, whatever you want.” ‘Cause they wanna go to sleep. I love that about him. He’s not going out at night. The only thing going anywhere is his hairline. And I love that, clearly. If you wanna meet an older man, go to a Walgreens. Go to the Advil section. Put some in the palm of your hand and just go… [clicks tongue] They’ll limp over like delicate pigeons. Adorable. We actually… We got engaged in six months. Yeah. Because he doesn’t have a lot of time left. I had a bachelorette. It was pretty crazy. But bachelorettes, they’re intense, you know, right? I feel like bachelor parties, all the guys do is see a quarter of a nipple, and they’re like, “It was the greatest weekend of my life.” I think bachelorettes are cults. [woman 13] Yeah, for sure. And if you’re quiet right now, you’re in one. ‘Cause think about it. Stephanie chooses you to be a part of something bigger. And then she takes you to an undisclosed location. Scottsdale, Arizona. You’re dehydrated. You’re sunburned. You’re scared. You’re blackout. You’ve lost $2,000. You’ve also lost your job. If you even look at another bridesmaid and you’re, like… Isn’t this a lot? She’ll be like, “Do you not support Stephanie?” And I’m like, “No, no, no, no.” “I’m here for Stephanie. I support Stephanie.” And then you have to give speeches every night about how great Stephanie is. I’m like, “This is Stephanie’s third marriage. I’m exhausted.” “We’re running out of stories, Steph.” And then she makes you all wear the same bikinis, even though we all have different body types. That’s abuse. We have to wear shirts that say, like, “bitch, bride, tribe, cunt.” I’m like, “How did we get here?” What I’m trying to say is Scientology started in Charleston, and no one talks about it. Nobody talks about it. [cell phone chiming] Oh! [laughs] Take your birth control. [laughing] Speaking of birth control, I, um, hooked up with my husband on our wedding night. Yeah. Did anyone… did anyone not hook up on their wedding night? Kevin, what happened? You what? You were… or you were running from the police. So you guys played hard to get on your wedding night. You were like, “Figure it out tomorrow.” What were you drinking? What’s your drink of choice, Kevin? [Kevin] Beer. Beer. [Kevin speaks indistinctly] You what? You took a what? [Kevin speaks indistinctly] A dick pill. You took a dick pill? Kevin, I didn’t ask about this. I don’t wanna know that. I asked about your beer. [laughing] So you were just passed out with a rock-hard dick. And she’s like, “Get it… stop poking me with that.” When did you take the dick pill in the night? I just wanna know. [Kevin] At noon. At noon? So you were on the altar just like… [laughing] Wait, so you planned to have a crazy, rip-roaring night of seven hours of sex and you had two beers, and you were like… [speaks gibberish] [laughing] You know, I support men taking pills. Because we’re taking birth control, Lexapro, Xanax. Take one fucking dick pill. Honestly, I think I had sex on my wedding night ’cause he’s sober. So he was ready to go, but I realized on my wedding night that I hadn’t taken my birth control in two weeks. And my friend Paige. You guys know Paige. [audience cheering] So she blacked out at my wedding. Stumbled over to me with her long little fingers. And she was like, “You’re gonna get pregnant on your wedding night.” And you know when, like, you can’t not believe her? ‘Cause if you do, you’re like, “Why didn’t I fucking listen to that blackout bitch?” I am so bad with my birth control. I’ll miss two days, I’ll take four. I miss five days, I’ll take seven. I’ll miss a week, and I’ll just put one up my butthole. I’m like, “I’m on track.” Does anyone cheat with an IUD? Do you have an IUD? [woman 14] Yes. What kind do you have? Copper, silver, rose gold? [woman 14] Kyleena. Kyleena. Why is it always a hot girl’s name? It’s like, “Kyleena.” “Mirela.” Did it hurt? [woman 14] Worst of my life. Ooh! I feel like they don’t warn you how much it hurts. I feel like a doctor takes a paperclip, and it’s like, “Hold on one second.” [shouts] Walk it off. When men get vasectomies, they get airlifted to the Bahamas. A nurse is cupping his balls. She’s like, “You’re doing amazing.” “Cough if you need. I’ll feed you grapes.” So I realize the night of my wedding… [exhales] …that, um, I was ovulating. I’ll explain what that is to you later, Kevin. And the next morning, I was like, “I need to wake this guy up.” “We have a problem.” He’s old, so whenever I wake him up, I’m always like, “Are you alive?” He’s like, “What?” [exhales] I’m like, “Do you wanna have a baby?” And he’s like, “I kind of wanna travel for two to three years.” And I’m like, “You’re 47. Where the fuck haven’t you been?” You wanna go to Mars, Jeff Bezos? Like, who do you think you are? Carmen Sandiego? I go, “You know what? Let’s travel to Walgreens, your favorite place, ’cause I need to get Plan B.” Now, I don’t care how many times you’ve been to this Walgreens, when you go for Plan B, you’ve never seen this establishment before. It’s dark. It’s haunted. It smells different. You’re full main-character energy when you walk in. You’re always like… [sighs] How can I get pregnant as a teenager? [sighs] What am I gonna do? [exhales] And then you go up to the guy who hates you, and you’re like, “Do you have Plan B?” And he’s like, “What?” And you’re like, “Plan B.” He’s like, “Hold on one sec.” “Disheveled girl in aisle six is irresponsible with her pussy lips.” “And she needs Plan B.” And he’s like, “Let’s go to the family planning aisle.” And I’m like, “No, no, no. I need the family unplanning aisle.” And then you get there, and it’s locked up like Fort Knox. They’re locking up everything nowadays, like multivitamins. Who’s tweaking on a multivitamin? And then he tries to open it up and you’re like, “Be quiet about it.” And then he takes, like, a power tool, and he’s like… [shouting] Um… and then he gives it to you, and you’re like, “Thank you. I’m a teenager.” And then when you go outside to open it up, it has seven layers of the hardest plastic I’ve ever seen in my life. And I don’t walk around with a chainsaw. [sighs] I’m trying to get rid of my maybe-baby. Anyway, that’s how I lost my virginity. It was crazy. That’s the thing with an older man. He is… he is deteriorating emotionally and physically, which is the goal. Like, before we got married, he really annoyed me because we went to a fancy Italian restaurant. This small restaurant. I ordered a burrata. Do you guys have burrata in Philly? [audience cheering] Oh, I love burrata. Three things better than sex. Burrata. Q-tip in your ear, ’cause it’s naughty. [laughs] And revenge. I fucking love revenge. So, I ordered the burrata. I open it up. It’s like… [squelches] You know… [squelches] He looks at me, and he’s like, “I think I’m gonna faint.” And I’m like, “I know. This burrata is so good.” [laughs] And he’s like, “No, like, could you call an ambulance?” And you know when that’s just, like, not the vibe? I start Googling. I’m like, “How do you even call an ambulance?” Is there, like, a quiet ambulance or, like, a Zoom or, like, a telehealth? And he’s like, “Can you just get the waitress?” And I’m like, “I’m not getting other people involved in your shit right now.” And finally, he hails down the waitress, and she starts freaking out. She starts calling. She’s like, “911, a man needs 911!” Everyone in the restaurant’s upset. They’re getting up. Some people are fanning him. He’s loving the attention. He’s like… [panting] Then, for the ambulance people to come, they had to, like, take the table away with my burrata. And I’m like, “Okay.” We also have to pay for this food, and I forgot my wallet in my other coat. So I was like, “Babe.” “Babe.” “Babe, I need your wallet.” He popped up, and he’s like, “I’m fucking dying here. You need my fucking wallet?” And the guy next to him is like, “Don’t speak to your daughter like that.” I’m like, “Thanks, Dad.” “We need to leave a hefty tip after the shit you pulled tonight.” And then the EMT lady came, and she knew exactly what was going on. I looked at her. She looked at me. He was having an amateur-hour panic attack. Now, as a hot girl, that’s just how we wake up in the morning, okay? I’ve had four panic attacks on stage tonight. And you know what we do? We suck it the fuck up! [cheering] But it’s not men’s fault, okay? ‘Cause if they feel any emotion besides anger, they’re like… [voice breaks] “Could you call 911?” So she looked at him, and she was like, “You know, you’re gonna be fine.” “Um, are you nervous about anything?” And he was like, “I am nervous about getting married in a couple months.” And I was like, “Oh, now we’re playing the blame game.” And she’s like, “Look, you don’t have to go to the hospital.” “Stop drinking so much Diet Coke. Drink the water, breathe.” “You’re gonna be fine.” He’s like, “Yeah, okay, I don’t have to go to the hospital. I feel better.” And I’m like, “This is so embarrassing.” So everyone goes back to their seat, and I’m like, “What is he gonna do?” Like, “How is he gonna get out of this?” This man stands up, and he goes, “It wasn’t the food. Have a good night.” And I’m like, “Did he just have a closer?” My dad thinks I’m on my phone too much. He’s like, “You’re addicted to your phone. You’re always on your phone.” I’m like, “Dad, you’re always on your phone.” “‘Cause you text with your index finger. It takes you fucking forever.” I’m on TikTok a lot. I am. I’m on TikTok. What’s interesting to me, who’s not on TikTok? Okay, why are you not on TikTok? Are you afraid to know who you really are? [woman 15] I’m 38. You’re 38, a young spring chicken. Are you on Reels? No, but Instagram. Like, I’m not even on Snapchat. You should not be on Snapchat. You’re 38. [laughing] It’s just 22-year-old dongs on Snapchat. If you’re on Reels, I feel like Reels is like Juuling. TikTok is cigarettes. We’re all gonna die. Also, if you’re on Reels, that means you just found out that Pete Davidson and Kim Kardashian broke up, and I love that for you. Love that for you. Do you see the kids still doing dances? Like, it’s been a while. They’re dancing a little too long. I was wondering, I’m like, “Why are they doing this”? And then I realized, I think these kids are communicating with each other. To overtake us. And this is a violent motion. You just saw my labia. That was crazy. [laughing] But think about it. These kids are strong. Like, they survived Tide Pods. They’re sturdy in a fight. And they’re smart. Like, when they were at restaurants, they had their iPads. Three years old. Beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep. Fuck you, Mom. Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. When I was two at a restaurant, I was trying to see how many butter packets I could shove in my face without puking. My dad’s like, “Nine. That’s my girl. She’s gonna go far.” Do you guys know Jeremy? I babysat this kid named Jeremy. I hate this kid. I’d have to bribe him to do everything. I’d be like, “Jeremy.” “If you finish your math homework, you get chocolate ice cream.” He said, “Shut up, slut.” I was like, “Jeremy, don’t talk to me like that, or you’re gonna turn me on.” We’re having fun. It’s Saturday. We’re having fun. [audience cheering] [laughs] What if I did that? That would be crazy. Every time… Anyway, back to me, um… I have intimacy issues. [woman 16] Don’t we all. Do you like to cuddle? You do? Do you like to be the big or small spoon? Both. He’s verse. He’s freaky. Actually, as a girl, it’s a lot more complicated when we’re the small spoon. Lots of things can go wrong. Think about it. First, you have to get into a weird little fetal position, right? Then you have to move your hair, so it’s out of his face but still looks cute. You’re like, “Hey!” And then he takes his big dumb hand. And he always puts it right here. Gut check. [gasps] You have to suck in like you’ve never sucked in before. You’re like, “I’m so little, so tiny.” “I’m so little.” [groans] He’s like, “Are you comfortable?” You’re like, “Sucking up my rolls!” But as you’re sucking in, God forbid a little air wants to come out. Your butt is right on his penis. The whole relationship is on the line. It’s so much pressure, and you can’t sweat even though there’s a hot body lying on you. So hold your pores. Hold your butthole. Just go… [shouts] There’s a zero percent chance you’re falling asleep. Meanwhile, he falls asleep immediately. The second his head hits the pillow, he’s like… [snoring] ‘Cause he’s so tired from gaslighting all day. It’s crazy. [audience cheering] But I like to pivot. I like to pivot and put my head on his chest. Life hack. Then you can lift a butt cheek. The air comes out silent. You pray it’s not sulfuric. You pray. You don’t wanna Oppenheimer his entire bedroom. If it smells, you blame the dog. I don’t know why there’s always a dog staring at you. He’s like, “Ever since I met you, the dog’s been having a lot of stomach issues.” And I’m like, “You should get that checked.” But I love to put my head on his chest. It feels so good. Because you feel his heart beating, and you’re like, “This is love.” And you feel his chest go up and down. And you’re like, “Wouldn’t it be so cute if I matched my breath with his breath, and we became one soul, taking on this harsh, cold, scary world together?” But then, as you’re doing it… [exhaling] You’re like deejaying your breath to his breath. You know when you’re going too slow and you feel like… [gasps] [exhales] You’re really trying to catch up. You’re fighting for your life. You kind of forget how to fucking breathe. There’s no air going in or out. You could die. The dog’s like, “Die, bitch, please die.” [laughing] Yeah. Also, sex in the shower. Don’t do it. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. Kevin, don’t. Don’t have sex in the shower, okay? ‘Cause guys and girls like different temperatures. Girls like it lava hot ’cause we’re related to Satan. And guys like it lukewarm ’cause they’re confused. They don’t know what’s going on. Then you go to his bathroom. He’s not gonna have conditioner, which is disrespectful. Doesn’t support women in the arts. Or he has the three in one. Which should be called zero. ‘Cause I’m dirtier after using it. And it always has these insane names. It’s like Rock Hard Mountain. Punch a Wall Pinewood. Throbbing Thunder. Like, is this an Andrew Tate haiku? [laughing] You know when he’s taking up all the shower water and you’re just, like, freezing your tits off, and you’re like, “How do I become Jack at the end of the Titanic?” [chuckles] There’s room for me here. You have to distract him and take your hair and put it on the back of his shower wall. This is how we mark our territory. It’s female graffiti. Put your fucking initials if you’re feeling artsy. ‘Cause he’s never washed that wall, and he never will. Also, don’t do anal in the shower. It will hurt so bad, my f-friend told me. [chuckles] Once a guy texted me to sit on his face. That’s not straightforward. No one tells you, you don’t actually sit on the guy’s face. You have to do this weird, like, hover. Like you’re at a Porta Potti at Coachella, okay? Oh. You gotta use your pelvis, get your core in. Do I like the fact that I can suffocate a tiny man with my labia? Absolutely. He’s having trouble. He can’t find your clit. He’s on your kneecap, and you’re like, “This feels so good.” You’re patting his forehead. He looks like a Ninja Turtle. Then, you know, halfway through, you just start spacing out at the white wall in front of you And you’re like, “How did we get here, Hannah?” Where is his headboard? Is that a Mike Tyson poster? Why is his name Eric with a C? [laughs] [laughing] You guys think I should have kids? [audience cheering] I’ll make a decision based on what you guys say right now. I’ll do it. [audience continues cheering] Okay, I’m getting a lot of mixed. You’re pointing at your daughter right now, saying “no”? She’s gonna be funny, have a good sense of humor. I like that. She’s like… But I do feel like I get mixed… I get a lot of mixed messages from moms. They’ll be like, “It’s the happiest you’ll ever be, but you’ll never be happy again.” And I’m like, what kind of fucking riddle… You’re a mom? [woman 17] Yeah. I actually became an aunt, though. I’m an aunt. So I’m an aunt. [audience cheering] I’m an auntie. I love when people congratulate me. ‘Cause my brother made a mistake. No, I’m just kidding. He did it on purpose, and I know that. ‘Cause him and his wife were going around being like, “We’re trying. We’re trying.” And I’m like, “Oh!” Just tell people you’re raw dogging. Stop romanticizing it. Me and you are doing the same. You’re praying for a baby. I’m praying to not have a baby. One more thing about abortion. [laughs] Have you guys seen Nick Cannon? Has he come to Philly? Close your pussies. It’s crazy out there. He has 12 children with six different women. I actually wasn’t that judgey. I was like, “Go off, Nick Cannon, do your thing.” Until I saw the name of one of these children. It’s a beautiful name. It was weird for me. The name is Powerful Queen. That’s an adjective. It was the full name that really got me. The full name is Powerful Queen Cannon. Because that’s the name of my vibrator. [exhales] Thank you so much, Philadelphia! [audience cheering] I love you guys so much! [“Sonata Slay” playing] [cheering continues] [shouting] [audience shouting] They told me I could stand up here for, like, ten seconds. I love you, babe.

              "'Joe Rogan, performing live in San Antonio, expresses his love for Texas, recounts his move there, and makes humorous observations about Texas weed, Buc-ee’s gas stations, and aliens. He discusses COVID-19 skepticism, political and social commentary, and his experiences with controversy, including Fear Factor and vaccine misinformation. Rogan also shares his thoughts on societal changes, the complexities of language, and the absurdity of certain behaviors and beliefs. Throughout, he maintains a comedic, irreverent tone, engaging the audience with his unique blend of humor and provocative insights. * * * [announcer] And now, live from San Antonio, this is Joe Rogan. [audience cheering and applauding] What’s up? What’s happening? San Antonio! The world got weird, but we’re all together. [audience cheering and applauding] We’re all together. And I wouldn’t wanna be anywhere else but here in Texas. Fuck, yeah. [audience cheers] Fuck, yeah. Thanks for coming out, folks. Thank you very much, appreciate it. [audience cheers] This is my new home state. I’ve been living here for four years, I fucking love it. [audience cheers] I love it here. I’m never moving. The only adjustment I’ve ever had to make is Texas weed. [audience laughs] You think it’s the same. Texas weed is different. Because Texas weed is grown on Texas soil. [audience cheers] And I believe the soil has memories. [audience laughs] Because if you smoke too much Texas weed, like… [inhales] We gotta give this land back. [audience laughs] Dude, what the fuck did they do? [audience laughs] I heard that every Buc-ee’s is built on an Indian burial ground. [audience laughs] Yeah. [laughs] That might be misinformation. Don’t say you heard it from me. I am known for that shit. [audience laughs] Buc-ee’s is where I take all my friends from California. They’re like, “Why do you like Texas?” I take them right to Buc-ee’s. “Behold!” [audience cheers] Behold the kind of gas station possible in the land of the people who conquered the Comanche. If you’ve never been to Buc-ee’s, it’s like if you were in the middle of a cocaine binge and you decide to make the ultimate gas station. And you fucking did it. [audience laughs] You really did it. You got a pile of your dad’s oil money, like… [snorts] [man] Whoo! “I wanna sell kayaks!” [audience laughs] I want my gas station now, pickled alligator dicks and Chuck Norris action jeans. [man] Woo-hoo! [snorts] How come you can’t vote here? [audience laughs] If you could vote for Trump at Buc-ee’s, the aliens would land. They would go, “What the fuck are you people doing?” I’m very invested in aliens being real. If they’re not, I’m gonna feel so fucking stupid. I’ve had so many dumb conversations about them. The dumbest argument that aliens aren’t real, “If aliens are real, why don’t they land on the White House lawn?” Oh, when you go fishing, do you check in with the president of the lake? [audience laughs] No, you just trick those dummies with fake food and pull them up, take pictures of them, drop them back in the water, and they’re like, “What the fuck just happened?” [audience laughs and applauds] Exact same things the aliens do to us. I think aliens look at us the same way we look at Waffle House fights. [audience laughs] They just observe, like, “What the fuck is going on?” If you could come from another planet, you think you’d wanna talk to Biden? [audience laughs] Like, “Take me to your leader.” “I got hairy legs. My uncle got eaten by a cannibal. [audience laughs] Come on, man.” [audience cheering and applauding] I think… [laughs] I think if I was an alien, I would treat us the exact same way the aliens do. I wouldn’t give a fuck who’s in the Pentagon. I would find some dude cooking meth in Arkansas, and I’d teleport him up into the spaceship and explain to him telepathically that time is an illusion, even though you can measure it, and all humans are the product of accelerated evolution put here to give birth to A.I. Then I’d drop him back off in the woods. [audience laughs] And say, “Now go tell someone, bitch. [audience laughs] Go tell them how I touched your butt.” [audience laughs] What? What’s that all about? The alien anal probe, we all know. Why do we know that? Why is that always a part of the story? Because it makes the story more ridiculous. Makes people less likely to believe. I think they’re going, “What if somebody believes him? Put something in his ass. [audience laughs] Make him love it. Make him just jizz all over himself.” Just, “Oh, shit. Oh, God.” Imagine if you have your greatest orgasm on an operating table in a spaceship? “Oh, Jesus.” [audience laughs] You’re gonna leave that part out. [audience laughs] Your story’s always gonna seem suspect. People gonna go, “Is that all?” “That’s everything. The whole story.” [audience laughing] Maybe that’s how they get our DNA. That’s how they get cum out of donkeys. [audience laughs] I used to host Fear Factor, and, uh… [laughs] [audience cheering and applauding] And… Thank you very much. Thank you very much. [laughs] This is a true story. Fear Factor was canceled because we made people drink donkey cum. [audience groans] I’m the only guy in Hollywood that lost a job because people had to drink cum. [audience laughs] Usually, that’s how you get a job. [audience laughs] And look, first of all, wasn’t my idea. Okay? I just worked there. And the way Fear Factor would work, I would show up, they’d give me a script of what the contestants had to do. I would read it and go, “What the fuck?” [audience laughs] But on one day in particular, it said they were playing horseshoes to see who had to drink the most donkey cum. And I said words I never thought I’d say. “I don’t think you should make people drink cum on TV.” [audience laughs] When I’m the voice of reason, you’ve got a really fucked-up program. [audience laughs and applauds] And here’s the thing, they had buckets, like Home Depot buckets, of cum. And I’m like, “How did you get that?” [audience laughs] You can’t just have that. You gotta tell me how you sourced it, okay? You gotta be real clear right away. We got laws, okay? So I asked the handler, “How do you get it?” He goes, “You take a cattle prod and you stick it up the donkey’s ass and you shock his prostate, and they just bust.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Whoa, that is so fucked up.” Then I was like, “What does that feel like?” [audience laughs] Like, you don’t wanna know. Like, what if it’s your favorite thing? Like… [grunts] You can’t even tell anybody. If that was your favorite thing, you gotta keep that to yourself. No one is gonna understand. They ask you, “What’s the happiest day of your life? Birth of your child?” Like, “Eh. [audience laughs] That was pretty good. But one time, I got abducted by aliens. They stuck the finger of God up my ass, and I jizzed out of every cell in my body. And I been chasing that dragon ever since. [audience laughs] I’m on my rooftop every night with a flashlight going: ‘Come back. Come back. Come back’.” [audience cheers and applauds] If they’re real and they’re watching… If they were gonna come, they would have come during COVID. It’s good to see everybody having a good time. The country’s almost back to normal before World War III. [laughs] [audience laughs and cheers] COVID was just so strange. We lost a lot of people during COVID, and most of them are still alive. [audience laughs] Yeah. Right? [audience cheering and applauding] Right? There’s a lot of people that I don’t fuck with anymore. Before COVID, I would have told you vaccines are the most important invention in history. After COVID, I’m like, “I don’t think we went to the moon.” [audience laughs] I think Michelle Obama’s got a dick. I think Pizzagate is real. I think there’s directed-energy weapons in Antarctica. [audience cheering and applauding] [man] Oh! I’m just kidding. I’m just kidding. I don’t think Michelle Obama’s got a dick, but I believe all that other shit. [audience laughs] Here’s one thing we found out during COVID. How disgusting men are. Because here’s a pop quiz: how many ladies got fired because they got caught masturbating during Zoom calls? [audience laughs] Was there even one? Out of all the crazy bitches out there, not even one is like, “Show me your fucking spreadsheet.” Not even one? Not even one. [audience laughs] Dudes were dropping like flies. It was the number one reason why men in executive positions got fired. I just made that up, but doesn’t it make sense? [audience laughs] You believed me. It tracks. [audience whooping] Men are so gross you can’t even set up in front of a camera with a… With a computer with a webcam pointed at us without a guy thinking, “What does this camera see if I get down like this here? Keep a poker face. If this dog stops barking so I can keep my hard-on.” You’re on an election call, like, “January 6th, lock them up. Lock them all up.” [audience laughs] Here’s the thing about jerking off. Everybody does it, but if you get caught, you’re a fucking loser. [audience laughs and applauds] “You fucking loser.” And you feel it too. You’re like, “Oh, no, I can’t believe I got caught.” “Everyone knows. Everyone’s gonna know. Oh, no!” [sobs] I’ve only been caught once in my whole jerking-off career. But it was by my wife, and she was so upset. She goes, “I can’t believe you did it while I’m at home.” I’m like… [winces] “I do it while you’re sleeping right next to me.” I do it like this. I do tiny strokes just to not wake the master. I put a glass of water on the bed to make sure I’m not making any ripples. I like to live dangerous. I eat supermarket sushi. I don’t give a fuck. [audience laughs] [man] Whoo! [laughs] I like to take fake risks. I like to take edibles before I get on airplanes. [audience cheers] Listen. It’s a way to find out what really bothers you. [audience laughs] I don’t like to give advice. I don’t give a lot of advice. But I will say this. 200mg is the right dose. [audience laughs] Don’t do it. Don’t do it. But if you’re gonna do it, that’s the number. This is why. If you wanna know what’s in the basement, you gotta go down the stairs. [audience laughs] You gotta go look around. A lot of people are like, “I like to microdose. It makes food taste better, makes sex feel better.” Uh-uh. You gotta get to, “What are memories made out of?” You know? You gotta get to, “Maybe the universe is God.” [screams] You gotta get to that place. The airport is the best place to be high in public. This is why. Because no one notices. Because everyone’s acting weird. [audience laughs] No one acts normal at the airport. They’re all standing around, talking quiet. They’re all worried they’re gonna die. When you’re high, you blend right in. [audience laughs] And you don’t have to do any thinking. They tell you what to do. “Get in line.” I’m like, “Okay.” [audience laughs] “Walk up here.” [grunts] “Give me your ticket. Sit down. Don’t lean back.” “I won’t. I won’t.” Strap yourself into your chair. And every now and then, they come by with water. You’re like, “Whoa.” [yells] You’re going 500 miles an hour, 30,000 feet in the sky, thinking about people you fingered in high school, going… [audience laughs] And you don’t think you’re gonna make it. “I can’t keep doing this.” But you can. It’s like a near-death experience you always survive. [audience laughs] And all my friends that don’t like weed say the same thing. They’re like, “Dude, it makes me paranoid.” Right. [audience laughs] Right. But when it’s over… But when it’s over. Everyone in this room that has ever been too high, the moment it wears off, you’re like, “Ohhh. I’m gonna be a better person. [audience cheering and applauding] I’m gonna be nicer to people. I’m gonna hug more folks. Like, half these problems have to be my fault.” The only time it’s ever been a problem for me is if you have to answer questions to an official person. Like, I have TSA Pre, which I really recommend if you’re not a terrorist. It’s a solid deal. If you give the government money, they let you keep your shoes on. You’re like, “Ah, thank you, overlords. So kind.” And it’s a nice way to separate society. ‘Cause you’re in this quick-moving line. You get to pass those barefoot losers with their shitty paperwork. My laptop’s in my bag, motherfucker. You know? You feel trusted. But I didn’t know that, uh, they still have to touch you even if you have TSA Pre. It’s a number thing. It’s a random number thing. So I walk through the cancer machine, and this light goes off. [audience laughs] And this is exactly how this lady said this to me. She goes: [imitating woman] “You’ve been randomly selected for additional screening.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] And I’m so high, I don’t even know if this is real life. [audience laughs] And I’m like, “But I got the TSA Pre.” She goes: [imitating woman] “Oh, I know. It’s dumb as fuck. But it doesn’t take long, so why are we fighting?” [normal voice] “We’re not fighting. I don’t wanna fight.” [audience laughs] She goes, [imitating woman] “Good. Male assist.” [normal voice] I’m like, “Male assist? Did you just assume my gender?” [audience laughing] Listen. [audience cheering and applauding] [laughs] That is a new thing you can say. That’s a new thing you can say, no matter what you look like. If you say to a person, no matter what you look like, if you say: “Did you just assume my gender?” Most people don’t know what to do. [audience laughs] She knew what to do. She goes: [imitating woman] “I’m sorry. Are you a woman, motherfucker?” [audience laughs] [normal voice] And we both looked at each other and went, “Ahhhhhh!” I go, “Oh, you’re high too.” So I high-five this nice lady, and they bring a man who starts touching me while he’s asking me UFC questions. [audience laughs] It’s one of the weirdest moments of my life because, first of all, I’m ticklish and trying to act normal. I’m standing here, and this dude’s on his knee going, “You think Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz ever gonna fight again?” [audience laughs] [audience cheering and applauding] [laughs] And I’m trying to act normal. “I hope so, bro. That’ll be a good fight, solid fight.” Then he hits me with this. If you’ve ever been randomly selected, this is what they do. He goes, “I’ll run the back of my hand against your crotch.” [audience laughs] Remember, I’m really high. [audience laughs] So I’m like, “Why are you gonna use the back of your hand?” [audience laughing and applauding] Is that the best way to do it? Hey, man, is that for you or for me? Because for me, it still feels like you’re touching my dick. You’re just doing it in this weird, dismissive way. Just… [grunts] It’s just a rude way to touch a dick. It’s like… [grunts] “Are you a terrorist? I’ll be the judge. [grunting] Nope. Just another dude whose dick I made feel weird.” I mean… [audience laughs] How many terrorists have they stopped with that? Is it zero or is it negative numbers? You disrespectful motherfucker. The back of your hand might be the worst way to figure out something. You ain’t getting no good data. [audience laughs] Why you touching dicks like that? [audience laughs] I tell you why, folks, because it’s our government’s solution to a complex problem. Which is, “How do you touch dicks and not be gay?” [audience laughs] [laughs] They’re like, “Got it. We’re gonna use the back of our hand. It’s no countsies.” [audience laughs and cheers] “Does it work?” “Yeah, try it on me, I can’t even cum. Come on, bro.” [audience laughs] Just jokes, folks, no one’s getting hurt. [audience laughs] I opened up a comedy club in Austin, Texas, a year and a half ago. Thank you very much. [audience cheering and applauding] When the world got crazy, I had to move to the Land of the Free. I love it. But one of the weird things about owning a comedy club is other people’s reactions. Fox News had the dumbest reaction. They’re like, “Joe Rogan created an anti-woke comedy club.” [woman] Yeah! I’m like, “Oh, you mean a comedy club?” [audience laughs] Like a regular one? That’s like saying I got a meat-eating steakhouse. You don’t have to use all those words. I get why young people wanna be woke, but I can’t do it, because I come from a different era, okay? [audience cheering] I was born In 1967, and when I was a boy, you could be Hitler for Halloween. Nobody cared. I never did it, but you could do It. Show up at your Jewish friend’s house, I’m like, “Aw, look at the little fuhrer.” Give a little tousle of your hair. Throw a candy in your bag. They knew you weren’t really Hitler. Like, he’s dead, and you’re 4. This is ridiculous. [audience laughs] And I get why the young people wanna be woke. I really do. Old people have fucked up the world. Let’s try communism. I get it. You don’t know any better. I get it. You’re young, I get it. And also, people desperately wanna be on a team. We’re tribal. There’s only two teams in this country, the left and the right. You know, you don’t wanna be independent. You don’t wanna be that weird dude telling everybody that gold Is the only legitimate currency and all tax is theft. [audience whooping and applauding] [man] Yeah! That’s me. [audience laughs] If you get me drunk, I will be annoying. I will tell some shit you already know. So I understand why people wanna be on a team. So you just try to find a team that aligns with your values, right? What does your team believe? “We believe that healthcare is a basic human right.” I agree. “We think that education should be free.” Me too. “And men can get pregnant.” Fuck! [audience laughs] Is that a package deal? How did that one slip through? [audience laughs] That wasn’t… All of a sudden, it’s an emoji on your phone. You probably don’t even know that you have that. If you’re a heterosexual man… And I know there’s a few of us left. [audience laughs] [audience whooping and applauding] You know… You know how when you type things, Apple gives you an emoji as a suggestion. If your friend’s, like, “Hey, you want to go out Saturday?” You text back, “I can’t. I’m trying to get my wife pregnant, man.” And you look down at your phone, and you’re like, “Is that Bert Kreischer?” [audience laughs] “What is that?” It’s a pregnant man. Oh, finally! Finally, there’s a pregnant man emoji. Representation. Finally, I could write, “eggplant, splash of water, pregnant man.” Finally. You ever see the regular man emoji? He looks like the guy Tiger King fucks in prison. [groans] Just listless and… The pregnant man looks robust, like Charles Bronson with a baby inside him. Like, “I’m the fucking future.” [audience laughs] It’s just new language, okay? I’m trying to learn your new language. I’m willing to say men get pregnant. I’m willing to say “pregnant men.” I just don’t think it’s a good… I think you need extra words. How many men can get pregnant? Not a lot, right? Is there anything different about the ones who can? Maybe we should use extra words, like we do with other stuff, like off-road vehicle. [audience laughs] It’s still a vehicle, but it can do some extra shit. [audience laughs] If you’re a dude and you can have babies, that seems really new. I’m not trying to be offensive. The last person I want mad at me is a pregnant man. [audience laughs and applauds] Do you have any idea how unreasonably confident they would be? You’ve got a full beard and you’re breastfeeding a baby, going, “I am in defiance of God!” [audience laughs] Big old thick neck and hairy tits. And the baby sucking on that nipple going, “Where the fuck is my mom? [imitating baby breastfeeding] [audience laughs] And why does this taste like jet fuel?” [audience laughs] I wanna know what’s going on. The world got weird. And here’s my take. I just wanna be real clear. I believe in trans people. I think the world is strange, nature is strange. Nature can throw you a curveball, and you believe you’re in the wrong body. And I fully support your right as an adult to do whatever you want that makes you happy. I believe in freedom, and I believe in love. [audience cheering and applauding] But I also believe in crazy people. And here’s the thing. That somehow or another, that got left out of the equation. All of a sudden, crazy people just went away, like the flu during COVID. Like, ah. It just got absorbed in the numbers. Suddenly, every man in a dress is stunning and brave. It’s like… Trans women are women. How about most? How about almost all? You gotta leave room for crazy. Plus, I’m sorry… I’m sorry if it’s taken me a while to adjust, but all my life, if there was a movie about a killer, he was way crazier if he wore a dress. [audience laughs] Psycho. He dresses like his mom. Stabs ladies in the shower. Silence of the Lambs. It puts the lotion in the basket. [audience laughs] Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf was dressed like a fucking lady. [audience cheering and applauding] I’m not prejudiced. I like to look at men in dresses like I look at everything else, on an individual basis. Mrs. Doubtfire seems like a lovely human, all right? I’m open-minded. I wanna know what happened. It’s almost like a pervert wizard waved a spell on the whole world. “With a wave of this wand, you can walk to the women’s locker room with a hard cock, and anybody who complains is a Nazi. Abracadabra.” And it just worked. And everyone just accepts this new reality. It’s fucking weird. I just think we need standards. You can’t just put lipstick on and shit in the women’s room. We need some kind of standard. [audience cheering and applauding] [laughs] Oh, my God. All of a sudden it’s a hate rally. I was watching a Roe v. Wade protest where there’s a dude in a dress. It’s a women’s reproductive rights protest, and there’s a guy in a dress with a hairy chest and a five o’clock shadow, and he’s screaming in a cop’s face, “Keep your laws out of my pussy!” [audience laughs] And no one there was like, “What the fuck?” [audience laughs] Everyone was like: [imitating woman] “Yeah, stay out of her pussy!” [normal voice] Oh, my God, we’re in Narnia. What is this? That’s a guy! First of all, that’s probably not even a trans person. That’s probably a Republican. [audience laughs] That’s probably an agent provocateur sent in to discredit your organization with ridiculous behavior. Look. [audience cheers and applauds] Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago. Listen. Listen, he’s right about a lot of… He was wrong about that one thing, though. But he’s right… The wrong thing was a big one. But he’s right… That one thing was huge. But he’s often correct. And I’m just saying. If you have a beard and a vagina, you’re a human escape room, okay? I… I don’t have time for puzzles. I’m just trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and how it got everywhere so quick. It’s in prison. In California, there’s 47 biological males that are housed in women’s prisons. A lot of them are sex offenders, but that’s not important. What’s really important is gender. Wouldn’t you think that out of all the places that would be suspicious, that maybe you would be lying? [audience laughs] Fucking jail. Wouldn’t that be at the top of the list? Imagine a woman, “I’m gonna go to prison, but at least I’m gonna be with other women.” You see R. Kelly with a wig on. You’re like, “Fuck.” [audience laughing and cheering] [groans] [audience whistling and applauding] I don’t know what happened. I think it’s China. [audience laughs] I’m only half kidding. I think they got us with TikTok. [audience laughs] I really do. I think they’re just really clever. They’ve been around for 4000… America’s the shit, but we’re real young. We’ve been around 250 years. Who knows if we’re gonna make it. China’s been here for 4000 years. They’ve invented everything. They invented paper, alcohol, gunpowder, rockets, noodles, Kung Fu, and TikTok. [audience laughs] Yeah, and Coronavirus. And I was… [audience laughing] I was… Hey, don’t be racist. China. I loved it when Trump would say “China.” [audience laughs] They also invent our phones. The craziest thing. That’s supposed to be our enemy, and they make our phones. Do you know how dumb that is? We let the enemy make our phones. We can’t make a phone. There’s 330 million Americans, plus Mexicans, and no one can make a phone? [audience laughs] “What’s the real number?” “Who cares, are you racist?” “I’m not racist. Let them vote. Give them money.” What’s going on? I don’t think we should have open borders. But maybe some of those folks sneaking in can make a phone. [audience laughs] I mean, some of them have to be valuable. These are ambitious people. If I lived in Guatemala, I’d fucking walk here too. If you can get across the Rio Grande River with a balloon filled with fentanyl stuffed in your ass… [audience laughs] …that’s the type of dude who can get shit done, okay? That guy will come through in a pinch, okay? He’s not gonna form a union. He doesn’t even know what the fuck “overtime” means. [audience laughs] I’ll trade him for everybody who has blue hair. “Fuck you, go back. Go there.” Let’s make America great again. [audience cheering] [laughs] Oh, this is the silliest show ever. I love it. Thanks for being here. You guys are awesome. This is fun. [audience cheering and applauding] [clears throat] I really am worried about China. I really am. [woman shouting] What are you yelling out? Go ahead, yell. You’re on TV. What are you saying? [man 1] Hey! [man 2] What about the Cobalt… Cobalt mine. Oh, congratulations, you know a thing. This fucking idiot. [mockingly] What about nuclear power plants? What about renewable energy? [normal voice] What a good time to yell that on live TV, fucking dipshit. [audience cheering and applauding] Imagine your whole life, “I’m gonna say something meaningful. It’s gonna make an impact. Cobalt mines.” [audience laughs] China does that too. You’re right. They buy our farmland all around military bases. We’re like, “Oh, it’s okay.” The craziest thing they’ve ever done. This is the craziest thing they’ve ever done. There’s a thing called The Bodies Exhibit. Do you know what that is? [man whoops] How many of you have been to The Bodies Exhibit? [audience whoops] [laughs] Okay. If you haven’t been, The Bodies Exhibit is a science museum. It’s a science museum exhibit of dead human beings. They take dead people, skin them, leave their dicks on, give them fake eyeballs and have them posed like doing sports. They’re throwing a javelin, playing poker. It’s the weirdest shit. But somehow or another, it’s okay, because it’s in a museum. If that same scene was in a serial killer’s basement… [audience laughs] If a cop went into a serial killer’s basement and found dead people playing sports, it’d be the front page of every newspaper. Like, what the fuck was that guy doing? Right? But it’s at the museum. And you’re like, “The windows are big. It’s cool.” [audience laughs] I went three times. You should go too. You can’t bring those people back. The last time we were there, we were like, “Why does everybody look Asian?” And we were like, “Where did they get these bodies?” So we Googled it. And you should too. ‘Cause the answer we got is, “Chinese unclaimed bodies which may include political prisoners.” [audience gasps] “May.” When the fuck do you ever get to use the word “may”… [audience laughs] …when people ask you where you got the dead people. What the fuck? Now I’m in the rabbit hole. You know how that goes. “What’s a Chinese unclaimed body?” We Google that. It’s any body left unclaimed for 30 days. Now here’s the problem. This process where they have to turn you into a statue after you’re dead, it has to take place within 48 hours of death. [audience laughs] Thirty days, 48 hours. I’m fucking terrible at math, but I can do that one. How did you guys not do this math? I’m in the museum, like, “This is a fucking murder exhibit.” And part of me is, like, “This is terrible.” And the other part of me is like, “How gangster are the Chinese?” This is… [audience laughs] That has gotta be the fucking coolest way to get rid of somebody. Can you imagine some Chinese diplomat comes home, and he catches the tennis instructor in bed with his wife, like: [Asian voice] “Oh, so you enjoy tennis. [audience laughs] Well, now you can play tennis forever!” [normal voice] And he could just go to the museum and visit this dude. Any time he wants. [Asian voice] “Oh, Mr. Big Dick, how’s your game? [audience laughs] You look a little sluggish. I’ll see you tomorrow. Ha-ha. [audience laughs] Ha-ha, motherfucker.” [normal voice] Everybody kills people in other countries, but they don’t turn you into a statue. That’s wild shit. You know, they do it to a lot of people there. You gotta mind your P’s and Q’s in China. You get disrespectful in a business meeting, next thing you know, you’re on a bike at the museum. [Asian voice] “Oh, look, there’s Harry with all his big criticisms about our infrastructure. [audience laughs] Look at you now, Harry. Riding a bike like a fucking asshole with your dick hanging out.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] I just wanna say, I admire what they’ve done. I’m not just saying that so I hope they don’t kill me. [audience laughs] I really hope they don’t. But if they did, it would be a funny way for me to die. If I went missing, then four months later there’s a short guy at the museum with a microphone. [Asian voice] “Oh, Mr. Funny Man, where’s your fucked-up accent now? [audience laughs] Go back to Fear Factor. Oh, you can’t. Ha-ha. Ha-ha, motherfucker.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] That would be a funny way for me to die. The funniest way for me to die is if I die from Covid. [audience laughing] Don’t think I didn’t think it! When I got Covid, the first thought I had was, “You better not die. I talked so much shit. I talked so much shit.” If I died from Covid, the memes would never end. [audience laughs] It would be me with two X’s for eyes holding a can of horse paste. “Apparently, fear was a factor.” [audience laughs] It would be funny. I would be laughing. I would be on my deathbed going, [laughs] “Fuck. Oh, no. Oh, no. Why didn’t you trust the science?” [audience laughs] [man] Whoo! Why didn’t I trust the science? [audience applauds] Thank you. Nobody likes a science denier. By that, I mean, dudes who believe in squirting. [audience laughs] Like, “Hey, man, they’ve done the research. It’s pee.” “No, dude. I’m telling you, it’s not pee.” “Dude, it’s pee. What are the odds that it’s a mystery fluid that comes out of an undiscovered organ and squirts out the pee hole? Like, hey, at least the Earth looks flat. I can see how you get confused.” [audience laughs] “It looks like pee, it smells like pee, it’s pee.” “Dude, it’s not pee.” “I’m telling you, she’s got a Stanley filled with sweet tea, she drinks it all day and she’s fucking lazy. She doesn’t wanna get up, she’s peeing on you, and you’re a fucking idiot.” [audience laughing and applauding] “You gotta believe the science. Trust us.” I heard that so often during the fucking pandemic. “Why don’t you trust the science?” I got canceled so often during COVID that sometimes I would find out by accident. [audience laughs] This is a true story. One time, I just woke up, I’m in my underwear, I plopped down in front of the TV, I turn it on. The moment I turn it on, Prince Harry’s talking shit about me. I’m like… [gasps] I just woke up. I’m vulnerable. I’m in my underwear, and there’s a prince on TV. Do you know how fucking weird it is when a prince knows your name? He’s like, [British voice] “Joe Rogan’s giving out dangerous vaccine misinformation.” [audience laughs] And my first thought was, “Fuck, did I? [audience laughs] I might have.” [audience laughs] But here’s my take on that, sincerely. If you’re getting your vaccine advice from me… is that really my fault? [audience laughs] Like, who are we protecting? Who’s out there going, “You know that dude who made people eat animal dicks on TV?” “How’s he feel about medicine?” Like… That’s not my job, kids. I’m a professional shit talker, okay? Some of the things I say make sense, a lot of them don’t. It’s up to you to figure out what’s what. That’s the fun part. Problem is, people say, “People listen to you and take your advice.” Well, take this advice: don’t take my advice. It’s the best advice. Don’t take my advice about 200 milligrams, and don’t take my advice about Covid. [audience cheers] Because when my wife had Covid, I fucked her twice. I wish I was lying. It was before any cure. I was following her from seven feet away, like, “You don’t look that sick.” [audience laughs] This is a real conversation we had. She said, “You are gonna catch it.” I go, “No, I’m gonna hold my breath. I can hold my breath for four minutes, let’s fucking go! Let’s fucking go.” I know why people got upset, I got it all. And I’m not even mad at Harry. If I was him, I would have said the same shit, I get it. If I met that dude, I’d love to have a drink with him. I genuinely think most people are good people. I think if you approach them with good intentions, have a good conversation… If I met that dude, I’d be like, “I’m not mad at you. In fact, I think if I lived your life, I would be you, and I think if you lived my life, you would be me. I think we’re all one. Let’s have a drink, relax. Have cocktails, have a good time.” Like most of us, right? [audience cheering] And the goal… The goal would be to get him about three drinks deep. And then go, “Hey, man, you ever do mushrooms?” [audience laughs] [British voice] “I heard they give you brain damage.” [normal voice] “No, that’s government propaganda. Listen… whatever you eat, I’ll eat double. Come on. Let’s go meet the aliens.” Could you imagine doing mushrooms with Prince Harry? Imagine if you could trick that guy into doing mushrooms with you? If you see him chew it and swallow it, you’re like, “Oh, it’s gonna happen.” There’s a moment when you do mushrooms, like 20 minutes after you swallow it… where you know you can’t throw it up anymore. [audience laughs] You know that moment? You’re like, “Oh no, it’s gonna happen.” Can you imagine that moment? You’re sitting criss-cross applesauce, just staring eye to eye with the prince, waiting. [audience cheering] And here’s the thing about mushrooms. Mushrooms take about 40 minutes to kick in… but about 35 minutes in, you hear them coming. [audience laughs] Right? Yeah. You hear footsteps in the distance like… [imitating slow footsteps] [takes a deep breath] [loud, droning hum] [audience cheering and applauding] And while Prince Harry’s tripping balls… I’m gonna hover over him and go, “Are you sure vaccines are safe? [audience laughs] Bitch, you’re not a scientist.” It was a weird time for me, Covid. I got in so much trouble. One thing they would do that was sneaky, is that whenever people were mad at me, they would take things that I’ve said drunk, high as fuck… and they would just put it in quotes. Like it’s a well thought-out statement. As if I’m standing in front of a judge, going: “Your Honor, I believe that lesbians lack the proper lower-back muscles to fuck a woman correctly.” [audience laughs] That was a real quote in an article about what a piece of shit I am. [audience laughs] And I read it, and I was like, “First of all, it’s true.” [audience laughs] I wish it wasn’t. I wish it wasn’t. But also, you can’t just put that by itself. Because I didn’t say it by itself. I wouldn’t just declare that. Like what a rude, shitty thing to say for no reason. I only said that as part of a conversation that I didn’t wanna have. Ever have one of those? You’re talking and somebody interrupts. I was at a bar with a friend in New York, we were drinking, having a good time, and there was this particularly aggressive lesbian lady at the bar, Which genuinely, I’m a fan of. I like wild people. She looked like Tom Arnold, had a Patagonia vest on. You know the type. [audience laughs] She was doing shots with her girlfriend. They were talking shit. [imitating woman] “Fuck, yeah, bitch!” [normal voice] Doing shots and kissing. Atmosphere! Fun! Yay! It was fun. But then she kept talking to us. Me and my friend are talking. She goes, “Sorry, boys, she only likes girls. And I got my own dick!” And I’m like, well, now we’re in a conversation. [audience laughs] Right? So I go, “Where is it?” And she said, “It’s a strap-on.” And I said, “Having a strap-on and thinking it’s a dick is like having a lighter and thinking you’re a dragon.” [audience laughs and cheers] “Plus, everyone knows that lesbians lack the proper lower-back muscles to fuck a woman correctly.” That’s the only time I would ever say that. It would have to be those words in that order, and I feel like if they put all that in that article, people would read it and go, “I see his point. [audience laughs] Yeah. They were just talking shit and she got out of pocket. That’s all it is.” Instead, they try to use that quote as proof that I’m homophobic. And I’m like, oh my God, there is so much better proof. You guys are lazy. Like, that’s all you dug up? First of all, it’s not true. But if you wanna take me out of context, I give you a lot to work with, you know? [audience laughs] For the record, I’m not even remotely homophobic. I’m the opposite. I wish I was gay. It looks way easier. You’re hanging out with only guys? No one can get pregnant? No more lies? I wish! And if I was gay, I get to use that F-word again. Oh, how I miss it so. [audience laughs and cheers] Oh, how I miss it so! Tony Hinchcliffe can still say it, but you know why. [audience groans] I used to throw that word around like a beach ball at a concert. Just, “Whee!” It was a fun word. Made conversations more festive. It was fun. And rarely did it have anything to do with gay men. But they took it just like they took the fucking rainbow, all right? [audience cheers] Because they’re men, and they’re greedy. They’ll tell you, “You shouldn’t wanna say that word. You say that word, you’re a homophobic piece of shit.” Or you’re calling your friend to wish him a happy birthday. [audience laughs] What about the fun way? There’s no gay people on this phone call unless the government’s gay, because you know they listen. There’s only one problem with that word, and that problem is that there are people in the world, although there’s less than there’s ever been, thankfully, there are people in the world that hate gay men. But nobody hates gay women, and that’s why you can say dyke. [audience laughs] You can say dyke at work, they’re like, “I’ll look out for her.” Nobody cares. Nobody even fake gets mad. Nobody hates gay women. In fact, men don’t even think they’re real. [audience laughs] Women believe in gay men. If a woman sees two hot guys kiss, she’s like, “They’re gay.” A guy sees two women kiss, he’s like, “Pfft. They think they’re gay. But that’s just ’cause they ain’t got a piece of this sweet dick, kid!” [audience laughs] Every man that has ever lived… you give him three drinks, he thinks he can fix a lesbian. Like, “Dude, I’m the one, I’m fucking Highlander. I got the tools. I can fix her.” And also, for whatever reason, men don’t seem to care if girls have done gay stuff. Again, I’m just a journalist, and I report what I see in the field… and I’ve noticed if you’re talking to men, and they’re being honest… Gentlemen in this room, I want you to imagine, you’re on a date with a woman and she’s the one. If you get lucky, you will find the one. But sometimes you’re not with the one, it doesn’t seem like it’s gonna happen. One bad relationship after another, you’re so frustrated, am I ever gonna find someone I fucking love? And then finally, you’re on a date with the perfect person. She’s so fucking cool, you’re drinking margaritas, you’re imagining having a family together. And she’s like: [imitating woman] “In the interest of full disclosure… I just want you to know that for the last 10 years I was in a relationship with a woman.” [man whoops] [normal voice] And you’re like, “Low miles, whoo!” [audience laughs] You call your friends up, “Dude, it’s like a barn find! Yeah, it’s like a ’69 Mustang that was under a tarp. [audience laughs] A lady had it. Yeah, she took it out every couple days and licked it. Look at all the rubber on those tires. Look at the suspension.” [laughs] I don’t know why men think that way, but I know some women get very angry. This lady waited for me after a show to lecture me. She waited for me, she’s like: [imitating woman] “You don’t care if the woman does gay things if you don’t care about the woman.” I’m like, “Okay, Socrates.” Like, what? Why don’t you write that shit down on rocks so people in the future can read it, you fucking imbecile. I hate dumb people that are confident, you know? Also wrong. I hate dumb people that are wrong and confident. Because she’s wrong. Like, I love my wife more than anyone I’ve ever met in my life. She is my favorite person. [audience cheers] Thank you. But… [audience laughs] If I came home tonight and was like, “Hey, baby, how was your night?” She’s like: [imitating woman] “Fucking Melissa tricked me into licking her pussy.” [audience laughs] [normal voice] I’d be like, “Well… don’t do that a lot.” [audience laughs] I’ll be walking that fine line between creepy and supportive. Like, “If that happens again, make sure I’m there in case that bitch goes crazy.” [audience laughs] [laughs] No women think that way. Zero. No women think that way. People say there’s no difference between men and women, it’s just cultural. [grunts] That seems like… No women think that way. I don’t care how open-minded you are. I don’t care how progressive you are. If you’re a heterosexual married woman… [imitating woman] and you’re at home just reading a book… waiting for my man… [normal voice] And he comes to the door: “You are not gonna fucking believe what happened. [audience laughs] [exhales deeply] [imitating woman] “What? What happened?” [normal voice] “Mike tricked me into sucking his dick again.” [audience laughs] [imitating woman] “How does this keep happening?” [normal voice] “I don’t know, it’s crazy.” [imitating woman] “Okay, what is going on, are you gay?” [normal voice] “No. Mike is just really tricky.” [audience laughs] They’re gonna say that’s a homophobic joke. And I’m gonna say how? Because the gay guy wins. That dumb straight guy keeps sucking his dick. That’s a W for the gays. They wanna tell you you can’t make jokes about them. If you want equal love, you have to have equal jokes. Because that’s how we find out if you’re annoying. [audience cheers] Yeah. If we can’t joke around about you, we know you take yourself too seriously. They’re trying to say they’re hateful, it’s hateful. Listen, I don’t hate anybody. I love everyone. And I love gay men. But I think about gay men the same way I think about mountain lions. I’m happy they’re real, but I don’t wanna be surrounded by them. [audience laughs] They’re dudes who fuck dudes. I don’t like my chances, okay? They’re not unicorns, they’re just men who fuck men. And every man who’s ever lived is a shifty cum salesman, okay? All of them, 100%. Especially the ones who say they’re not. Every man who’s ever lived is a foreman of a small, 24-hour sperm factory with a shaky agreement with the union. You got one warehouse, that’s your balls. One delivery truck, that’s your dick, and packages are constantly stacking up. And you’re like, “Hey, we gotta get this product out of here!” [audience laughs] And if your product sucks, you become a male feminist. And these are the facts. [audience cheers] That’s what it is. And some of these guys are trying to get rid of gay jizz. It’s normal. [man cheers] They just got the gay gene. I love them. I love everybody. You can’t control your genes. Obviously, it’s a gene thing. You know, we can’t… Like, you ever done a gene test? I did one of those. I found out I’m 57% more Neanderthal than regular people. [audience laughs] Yeah, I’m fucking handicapped. Yeah, Europeans killed my people too, where the fuck’s my casino? Huh? [audience laughs] I want my cave back! That was a big number. I showed my wife. “I told you this wasn’t regular stupid.” [audience laughs] But she had a really good point. She goes: “But all people came from cave people, right?” Which is a fucked-up thing to think, that everyone in this room is here because somewhere in our ancestry, someone had sex before they figured out doors. That was a long time! Thousands and thousands of years, no doors. Just wild monkey people trying to run away from cats. This thing we’re doing right now, this is so recent. Civilized society where a bunch of cool people can hang out together, we don’t know each other, have a wonderful time, drink cocktails. This is so recent. [audience cheers] But there’s such a thin veneer on this society. That’s why you have those thoughts. You know those thoughts? “I can’t believe I’m thinking that, I would never do that.” How about this? I know you have this thought. When you’re in your car and the light turns green but the scooters keep coming? [audience laughs] And you just wanna go to jail! I wanna see masks fly off, and backpacks. “Fuck you for feeling safe!” You know those thoughts? You don’t do it, but you know those thoughts? How about this? You ever be in line at Starbucks, and there’s a cop in front of you, and he’s not paying attention? [audience laughs] And you’re like, “I think I can take his gun. I’m gonna hit him now and John Wick the fuck out of this room.” You don’t do it, but you think it. That’s why we need homeowners associations, IRS payments, student loans, credit card debt. We gotta be distracted. We can’t keep society going with those thoughts. I have my most fucked-up thoughts talking to really smart people. Because I can’t keep up, so I just start thinking my own things. [audience laughs] “I bet they’re not thinking this.” Because, like, I’m friends with Elon Musk, which is the intellectual equivalent of a boy and his dog. [audience cheers and applauds] He’s so much smarter. You know when you’re around your dog, he’s like, “You’re different. tell me what to do.” That’s me. I’m like, “When they land, you’ll tell them I’m cool?” [Rogan and audience laugh] I was having a conversation with that guy where he was explaining to me how this rocket ship his company designed is gonna move civilization to Mars and about how we have to become a multiplanetary species to survive natural disasters, and it’s a six-month journey in this rocket. He’s telling me all the calculations, and halfway through him explaining this, I stop paying attention. And while he’s talking, all I’m imagining… I’m imagining four dudes strapped into a rocket, on their way to Mars. [imitates rocket] One guy pulls out a gun. Boom! Shoots that guy. Bang! Shoots that guy. Boom! Blows his own brains out. Leaves one guy alive going: [screams] Flying all the way to Mars, strapped in next to three dead dudes. I don’t know why I was thinking that. I wish I was paying attention. I’m talking to the smartest guy alive, and I’m thinking, “Should I tell him? [audience laughs] I should probably tell him my idea. He doesn’t know you can get a gun up your ass.” I had a whole backstory. That guy had an affair with that guy’s wife and tricked him to go to Mars. Yeah, he’s not… Elon’s not thinking these things. He’s… If evolution’s real, that guy’s ahead of us. I don’t know if evolution’s real. I’ve done zero research. I always say I think it’s real, because if you don’t, people are mean. But it’s a terrible story. Like, if a moron told you the story of evolution, you’d be like, “What happened?” “Once upon a time, giant lizards ruled the Earth, then a rock came from the sky and killed them. Then a little shrew just kept doing its best. And one day it became a person.” [audience laughs] I thought, “Yeah, fuck that story, I’m sticking with Jesus.” [audience cheers] That story sucks a fat dick, son. Because even if you’re right, you have no incentive. If we all go to darkness, I think I’m going to heaven. I sleep like a baby. You’re on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. You’re a fucking idiot for not believing in dumb shit. You sleep better. Look, I believe in evolution. I just don’t think all the monkeys crossed the finish line at the exact same time. [audience laughs] I have a feeling there’s probably some trial and error. You know? And I have a feeling somewhere in my ancestry, someone was like, “Fuck it. One more time with a monkey.” [audience laughs] Probably late in the game too, like at the buzzer. If you know, evolution probably took a long-ass time. Not like one day we woke up and we were people. It was thousands of years, a lot of gray area. And if you know human men, there had to be a moment in history where a group of guys had to pull their buddy aside and go: “Hey, man, you gotta stop fucking monkeys.” [audience laughs] “Dude, she’s cool.” [audience laughs] “She does sign language.” Like, “Sign language?” You look over, the monkey’s going like this: [audience laughs] “Man, I don’t think that counts. I don’t think that’s real sign language.” [laughs] [sighs] [men hollering] Genes are so weird… Thank you. Genes are weird because people are proud of them, but didn’t do shit to earn them. But we’re all guilty of it. If you do a DNA test and find out you got some cool stuff in there. Like, I found out I have 1.6% African in my DNA. [audience cheers] Thank you! It’s all dick! It’s not a big number. That’s not my point. Here’s my point. 1.6% is not a lot of African. I don’t know what percentage African you have to be where you can freely say the N-word. [audience laughs] But from my personal experience, I will tell you that 1.6% appears to be insufficient. [audience laughs] The juice is not worth the squeeze, kids. Yeah, nobody gives a fuck about context. So I don’t say the N-word, but I definitely have, and… I would lie to you, but there’s a lot of evidence. Like… [audience laughs] I never said it to be racist, because I’m not racist. But if I was gonna quote a great Richard Pryor bit, I wouldn’t fuck it up by saying “the N-word.” I’d just say the actual word. I thought everybody would understand. But then somebody made a compilation of every time I ever said that word over the last 15 years, and they made a YouTube video, and it turns out that looks racist as fuck! [audience laughs] Even to me! I’m me, and I’m watching me, and I’m going, “Stop saying it! You’re not allowed to say it!” I put my cursor over the video, I’m like, “Four more minutes?” [audience laughs] “Oh, my God, I gotta move to Florida. I gotta live with the swamp people now! Because I said me a magic word.” Here’s the thing about these words, you can’t say them. But that’s unfortunate. Because words are just supposed to be a sound you make so I know what you’re thinking. I can’t wait until we can read minds. Because a lot of people out there say, “Have a nice day”, and they want you to get AIDS. [audience laughs] Okay? I don’t think the sound you make with your face is our big problem. And I don’t think we should ban words, because some of them are fun to say. Here’s my suggestion. I think you should pay money to use the most offensive words then that money goes to cancer research. I think we can fix cancer. Here’s my thought. Every time you renew your car registration, you can buy five “retard” tags. [audience laughs] Imagine if that’s all it took. Imagine if retard tags cured cancer. How would CNN even report on it? [audience laughs] But you know, a lot of people will tell you: “Hey, you should never say that word.” And you know what? I agree. You should never say that word sometimes. [audience laughs] Right? Sometimes. Like, if you’re a good person… If you’re talking to a child with a developmental disorder, you would never dream of using that word, right? But if you’re talking to a regular grown man who made a documentary about the world being flat? [audience laughs] Yeah, he doesn’t have extra chromosomes. He’s fucking retarded. [audience cheers] And if you don’t say it that way, he doesn’t know how you really feel. And he doesn’t get the feedback we all need to learn and grow. A lot of people say, “You’re a hypocrite. You’ll say the R-word, but you won’t say the N-word?” Yeah! [audience laughs] Because I’m more afraid of Black people than I am retards. [audience laughs] Duh. Don’t you know how jokes work, faggot? [audience laughs] It’s all just supposed to be funsies. Words are for fun, kids. Try explaining that. “Why did you laugh at that?” You go to work tomorrow, “It was really funny.” [audience laughs] The problem isn’t words, folks. The problem is phones. We have these complaint boxes we carry around with us. We’re constantly checking in to see what the most complain-y people think about everything. And it’s not a lot of people. And it’s affecting culture. This is what most people don’t know. Ninety percent of all tweets are made by 10% of the people. And those people are 100% retarded. [audience laughs] It’s phones! It’s being connected to everywhere. And it’s weird. We’re weirdly connected. Like, I never leave my house without my phone. I leave my kids at home all the time. [audience laughs] I love my kids way more than I love my phone, but I will let certain people watch my kids, you know? Like my wife’s mom, she’s an amazing grandmother. Never trust that bitch on my phone. Like, “Hey, get out of there, Nana! That’s my real brain.” Can you imagine unlocking your phone, giving it to your wife’s mom, going “I’ll be back in an hour”? [audience laughs] Look, I’m a good guy, but I say a lot of shit to my friends that I don’t really mean but I think it’s funny. I don’t wanna have to explain that to a 75-year-old lady. [imitating woman] “Look, read it. He says he’s gonna kill you and fuck me. [audience laughs] He sent that to all his friends. And they all thumbs-upped. Look at all the thumbs up, these fucking psychopaths. Oh, and there’s a lot of pictures of other guys’ dicks on his phone. Do you know about those?” [normal voice] I send my wife pictures of other dudes’ dicks just to see if she’s paying attention. [audience laughs] If you wanna find out if you got a good jewel, you gotta bring them a fake diamond. You gotta stay crafty or these hoes get bored. Every day’s a fucking game! [audience laughs] No, not really. “What, really?” No. My wife’s mom is a lovely lady. She’s 75 years old and single. So I said to my wife, “Why don’t we take her to one of those nice places where there’s guys her age.” She goes, “No. They all go crazy and they get STDs.” She has an article saved, an article about a rash of STDs at nursing homes. I’m reading it, I go, “Okay, this is the difference between you and me. Because if there was a place where I could take my grandpa and he would definitely get herpes? I would fill that old dude up with so much viagra that he goes deaf. I’d give him a couple extra twists of his mustache and push him toward those old hoes. “Let’s go, Grandpa!” I’d be in that parking lot with a conch shell. [imitates horn] Every man wants his grandfather to be the savage of the nursing home. You go to visit grandpa, he’s got an army helmet on, open bathrobe, bottle of Jack, big old hard-on, blacked-out naked old ladies in his room. He’s like, “I fuck, and I wait for the Lord!” [audience applauds] [laughs] I’m glad you guys laughed because my wife didn’t think any of the shit I just said was funny. She’s like, “Don’t write it down.” I’m like, “You’re too close to this, baby.” She goes, “Who wants to have sex with a 75-year-old woman?” I’m like, “A 102-year-old man.” He’d be pumped. “She’s a good one. She was born after the war. They had better food.” He survived ‘Nam, let him fuck! “This is bullshit. You don’t mean it. You don’t want that for your grandfather.” That’s what he wanted. He told me. He told me! I’m not guessing. I was very close with my grandfather. I got drunk with my grandpa before he died. I go, “Grandpa, how do you wanna die?” He goes, “I want a Russian nurse riding the old shlazool, with her hands on my neck, and right when I’m about to nut, I wanna look her in the eye and go, ‘Fuck you, and fuck Stalin.’ [imitates choking] [audience laughs and applauds] And bam! I had a great life.” I will never forget that day because I was 6 years old. [audience laughs] San Antonio, I love you to death! Thank you very much, this was a lot of fun! [audience cheers and applauds] We did it! We did it! This was the first time I’ve done anything like this live, it was fun! I can only do it because you people are so fucking cool! Thank you very much! Thanks for coming out! Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, brother. Thank you. Thank you! [rock music plays] Thank you! Thank you, guys, thank you! Thank you. Thank you, guys. Let’s fucking go. Let’s fucking go! Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. We’re a part of each other’s lives forever. Thank you!

fortune feimster whoo oh my goodness seattle oh my gosh thank you guys so much this is incredible look at this keeping it handsome i dont wanna bum the fellas out right off the bat i am taken you guys so keep it in your pants or take it out of your pants i dont care just dont hand it to me i wouldnt know what to do with it anyway it would be like a cat with a cat toy i got married to my awesome wife jax in october thank you in the middle of the pandemie so when it came to our honeymoon i wanted to go all out uh jax picked the place she wanted to go to the maldives uh a travel agent planned everything i just showed up i found out on the plane it takes hours to get there yeah thats a lot i wouldve been fine with chuck e cheese so about hours into this flight i was like you know what i should learn something about the maldives i dont know anything about this country and jax had brought this little book of fun facts so i start reading some fun facts it said that the maldives is in the indian ocean great its comprised of islands awesome i read some more fun facts it said it is illegal to be gay in the maldives im like were going on our gay honeymoon to a country where it is illegal to be gay so im like haha okay um maybe its an old law its not in practice anymore and it said oh no thats what it said in the book oh no it is illegal to be gay at whatever time youre reading this its illegal it can lead to eight years in prison yeah lashings i dont even know what that is but i dont want it so im on the plane looking at my brandnew bride with very different eyes all the romance has left my body cause heres the problem between the two of us only one of us can pass for being straight and the other one gets called sir every time she walks into a bathroom yeah happened to me at disneyland i was coming out of the bathroom i got called sir and i didnt know what to say so i turned around and i said its maam then i walked out like this i can see how thats confusing i was like all right i need to look at this itinerary it said that hours into this flight we actually have an overnight layover and our overnight layover is in qatar now i dont know if you guys knew this but it is more illegal to be gay in qatar it can lead to life in prison floggings again what is this weve now landed were walking into the hotel im panicked and jax says listen when you get nervous you offer up way too much information now is not the time so we have one room booked were filling out the paperwork and the woman at the front desk asks one bed or two and jax isnt answering and i could find myself shifting im turning into a pretty little lady i said wed like two beds im traveling with my cousin were going to the maldives our husbands are already there they were roommates and fraternity brothers in college they just love going on these guy trips and playing golf and smoking cigars were just gonna have a little girl time were gonna get our nails done and go shopping none of that gay shits going on here jax is like shut up we get our keys we run up to the room im acting like theres cameras inside of the hotel room i did in fact sleep in that other double bed on the first night of my honeymoon i slept in a nightgown headtotoe nightgown i dont even know how that got in my bag you just land in qatar and a nightgown appears in your luggage i kept having these nightmares that someone would break in the room and put me in handcuffs and as theyre hauling me off i look back at jax and i yell tell my story cousin next morning we run to the plane sixhour flight land in the maldives then we take an hour puddle jumper to a remote island and theres a woman from the resort on the dock holding a bucket of heinekens for all the passengers its a very fancy place jax goes to reach for these heinekens and i go aah no lesbian beer its a trap i flung it out of her hand and ran like a damsel in distress ah i was like oh my god what if this island is just full of a bunch of gay booby traps what if they offer us free crocs how am i gonna turn that down i was afraid there would be a granola trail leading to a bottomless pit i was like im not gonna be able to swim all week cause everybody knows i swim in an xxxl tshirt with the sleeves cut off and a pair of sweatpants its my lesbian swimsuit i just wanna be under the radar normally on your honeymoon youre shouting it from the rooftops we get to our bungalow and theres a cake waiting for us that says happy honeymoon i was like aah i grabbed it and i threw it in the ocean i ate a slice first im not crazy we were there for a whole week we got one picture together jax and i are standing seven feet apart with a random family in between us just both giving a thumbsup it was the least romantic trip of our lives but a beautiful country i highly recommend it to all of you nongay folks im learning a lot about marriage uh communication very important you have to learn how to fight because that is an inevitable part of communication now if you are in a newer relationship and you wanna figure out how each other handles stress you should travel together because traveling is stressful it is why louise drove thelma off that cliff i told you not to eat my snacks now early on in our relationship jax and i uh we went to italy and we landed in rome and we had to take a train from rome to naples those train stations are so chaotic our trains leaving in minutes we dont know where our platform is and at the time jax was a kindergarten teacher so she would talk to me like i was a fiveyearold she even said at one point when the hand goes up the mouth goes shut wow and it works so we had to figure out where to go and she bends down and she goes hey are you listening hey im like yes she said i want you to stay right here okay stay right here and hold our luggage cause youre a little bit stronger than me im gonna go find our platform cause im a little bit smarter than you i was like you couldve ended on the compliment she said whatever you do do not leave im like i got it god she said did you wash your hands yes let me smell em no so she leaves im standing there its so hot people are passing by me speaking italian theyre like pizza pasta meatball now im hungry shes been gone forever so i start showing people our ticket and someone points me in the right direction im like i know jax told me to stay right here but i think i could be more helpful if i go to the train in the airconditioning put our bags up i can start eating biscotti and ill text her where to go so i leave this spot dont you turn on me i go to the train put our bags up i start popping biscotti and i text jax where to go its minutes till our trains leaving she does not answer ten minutes till the trains leaving i call her she doesnt answer that its now five minutes till our trains leaving and im like well one of us should enjoy this trip three minutes till our trains leaving i have one foot on one foot off im looking down the platform like oh my god oh my god i spot jax i wave her down and she starts running as hard as she can down this platform im like oh my god this is so romantic i have never had anyone run down a platform for me she gets on the train doors shut right behind her and i go ♪ reunited and it feels ♪ and she goes what the fuck ugh thats not part of my romcom julia roberts doesnt say what the fuck she says i have been looking for you for the last minutes i said i texted you she said my phone doesnt work in europe i said i dont know your phone plan then the entire train shushed us and they pointed at a sign it turns out we had accidentally bought a ticket on the quiet car i wouldve never bought a ticket on the quiet car cause im like how we gon chat but now jax wants to fight and im like thank god we got tickets on the quiet car shes going in and i go i sit down so proud of myself thinking i have gotten out of a fight she found a new way to fight she goes this goes on for like minutes we were so exhausted from mimefighting that we completed two of our exercise rings on our apple watches we both eventually passed out hour and a half later we woke up in naples biscottis rolling down my shirt totally forgot what we were fighting about so my advice to all of you new couples is go to bed angry im telling you just sleep it off it works for bears why cant it work for us and if you go to europe and you take a train just know one of you is gonna mess up so i highly recommend you book a ticket on the quiet car it could save your relationship it is much cheaper than a therapist and it comes with biscotti so that is my advice to you guys now i never had a serious relationship before jax she is definitely my most serious relationship now my parents divorced when i was and i dont know how this happened but i somehow became my moms husband which is weird because i have two older brothers so i dont know why i was the man of the house but i had to make sure everything was okay i set her alarm clock every night as i got older i became my moms plusone in social situations when i was in college my mom and i went on trips that were way too romantic for like a mother and daughter we went to new york city and shared frozen hot chocolate at serendipity and we walked arm in arm in central park and when youre single theres no one to be like hey thats weird youre on a date with your mom when i moved to la she and i went on a christmas caribbean cruise together yeah shared a room thats too much time with your mom i started dreaming of icebergs i said mom why dont you go out there on the ship and try to meet somebody your own age she goes why would i wanna meet somebody when i have you im like oh my god we are headed for a grey gardens situation mom stop talking to that squirrel i got a break at one point from being her husband she got a boyfriend yeah they met in the newspaper in the classified ads no pictures you just had to like each others grammar but she was a single mom of three kids and she was a schoolteacher so she was broke and after date one she was sold on this guy she comes home she goes i like him he is rich i said how do you know cause he told me oh okay sure she goes i know from three things i said thats very specific she goes number one he drives a mercedes convertible that is rich i said yeah but what year is it cause when i was in high school i drove a bmw but it was years old and it was a stick shift and it would just stall in the middle of intersections and i would have to fred flintstone this car out of the intersection to keep from getting hit when i was going down hills sometimes the brakes would just give out so i had to pull up the emergency brake in order to come to a complete stop and when it rained dirty rainwater would seep through the sunroof so i would have to drive with my head tilted to keep from getting pink eye im just saying followup questions are important she said number two he has his own tanning bed i was like now for all you younguns out there tanning beds were all the rage in the people were hopping in those things left and right it was like the cold plunge of today instead of helping with circulation it could cause cancer but oh you looked great in the winter and number three she was the most impressed with this she thought this was the measure of success she says he owns his very own industrial crushedice machine he is rich she would go to his house on the weekends and take a cooler and fill it up with crushed ice come home like she was holding a golden bounty crushed ice for a week i was like dinner would be nice but slushies it is couple years later they broke up my mom was crushed sorry sorry she was crushed unlike her ice she had to go back to that broke ice the ice in the trays where youre filling it up with water and youre like trying to put it in the freezer and everythings spilling youre like ugh no i didnt meet jax until i was my mom had gotten very comfortable uh with me being her husband and at she did not think i was in danger of getting took so something happened when i met jax that i did not expect my mom got a little jealous yeah i remember if i would buy jax something like a scarf my mom would be like i like scarves im like youre not my girlfriend their birthdays are five days apart which is my nightmare i get heart palpitations in february i remember early on in my relationship it was very popular to go on facebook and profess your love for whoever you were with so jaxs birthday i go on facebook and im like i love you so much youre the greatest thing thats ever happened to me i posted like pictures in a collage that took five hours to put together five days later i call my mom hey mom happy birthday thank you are you okay im fine well what are you doing im on facebook i was looking at my messages and i dont see one from you and i know your thumbs work cause you used them five days ago i sent you an edible arrangement what is this but she was pissed so i had to unfriend her i dont know if any of you guys have ever had to break up with your mom awkward once jax and i got married she had another family she had to deal with shed get a little jealous if i spent more time with jaxs family than my family and i was like well jaxs mom makes us apple pancakes and you just asked me to borrow its just different its just different but she does love jax she does she just thinks that jax stole her man my wife is jolene but i fly home to north carolina to have some oneonone time with my parents they like that i dont know what it is about going to my hometown but i immediately revert into a i could rent a car i am my mom insists on driving me everywhere so now i have to ask her permission to go places she has to approve who i hang out with its very weird as an adult even my taste buds revert back to when i was in high school like when im in the south i dont wanna eat at a michelin star restaurant i dont even trust their tires when im home i wanna eat fried food and i wanna eat biscuits for the european folks watching these biscuits are like your guyss but uh theyre fluffier and they have eight more sticks of butter now i love a place back home called bojangles pretty tasty biscuits but the one place that i dont think gets enough credit is a fastfood chain called hardees are you guys familiar with hardees now if you dont know hardees its owned by carls jr very similar vibes but hardees is known for their biscuits id have to factcheck this but i think its called hardees cause it could clog your heart and your arteries but mmm worth it now every woman has a biological clock mine is set to know when fastfood chains stop serving breakfast and hardees ends at last time i was home i overslept cause my mom didnt wake me up and i woke up in a panic i was like i need some biscuits and i looked at my watch it said it was i go mom mom mom mom mom mom i gotta borrow your car i gotta go get some biscuits she said my car is in the driveway and its already running why is your car already running well i was driving it this morning and i realized that if i turned it off it might not turn back on so i left it running in the driveway for the last hour just in case we need it i was like i dont have time to get into the nuts and bolts of this i guess im glad you left it running in the driveway and not the garage i gotta go get my biscuits so i threw on my flannel got in her car and i drive across town to the hardees its a small town i get to the drivethrough at theres a line to the street im like oh god everybody wants biscuits now normally i would park the car run in get those biscuits but ill remind you that if i turn this car off it might not turn back on and there aint no ubers in this tinyass town and yall know im not walking so im waiting in the line like come on come on i get up to the speaker and i just yell biscuits you cant waste time she accepts the order im like yes and then that car dies dead as a doornail right there in the middle of that drivethrough line im like no no no no no no no she goes no you dont want biscuits i go no no no i want biscuits im in my moms car and my moms car just died she goes ill cancel the biscuits no no no please dont cancel the biscuits will you just ring em up put em up front ill get rid of this car ill come in and ill get those biscuits she goes youve got two minutes bitch so i dont know what to do i cant walk through the drivethrough ive tried twice at midnight they do not like that i dont know how im gonna get rid of this car but you know how a mom gets that mom strength when her babys in trouble and shes gotta like lift up a bus to save her baby well all of a sudden i got that mom strength but for me my baby was biscuits so i put the car in neutral i get out of the car and i turn into an american gladiator and i start pushing this car inch by inch im like i sound like a feral cat these two guys in a truck behind me get out of their truck to come help me all they see are my broad shoulders from behind and they go oh hes got it and got right back in their truck im trexing this car im sweating my tits off which is even more confusing for those guys im in the zone theres one minute left theres parking spaces across the way i give the car one last goosh this car starts rolling i start sprinting towards the door at least i think im sprinting thirty seconds i can smell the biscuits its like the olympics of the south all of a sudden i hear a boom i look up everyone in the hardees is staring at me i had pushed that car so hard it rolled through the parking space over an embankment into a ravine the hood popped open smokes billowing out of it the alarms going off the trunk popped open im like oh my god biscuits got the biscuits shoved em in my mouth i did it i was so proud of myself i called my mom to tell her what happened and she told me i was grounded she said you are never driving my car again i said aint nobody driving that car again but i got my biscuits but honestly i dont know if my parents should be driving anymore theyre older now theyre in their late seventies and i dont know as their kid when do i have to have that talk with them to tell them they cant drive now i know with my grandmother what happened with her is she was driving one day and she was just chatting away and then all of a sudden she went across four lanes of traffic and we said well nana thats that she said i didnt even realize i was driving mmhmm yep were gonna need those keys were getting closer with my mom i can feel it we had just bought her a new car and she called me up and just very casually said hey i just drove off a cliff what i was driving i rounded a curb and i drove off a cliff i heard you i just dont understand what youre telling me my car flew through the air it landed on a large hill and then it rolled down to safety okay but how did this happen mom were you texting no i wasnt texting i wasnt talking nothing okay well did another car swerve into your lane no there were no other cars anywhere near me was it bad weather was it raining mmmm it was a beautiful sunny day one of the best weve had in a long time was it a sharp curve nope it was a very normal very approachable curve i said you didnt do this on purpose did you no i had just watched a pickleball tournament i have a lot to live for she said i just drove off a cliff and then she said one of the greatest things i have ever heard she said it was bound to happen one of these days what well ginger thats that were gonna need those keys now my mom has always been quirky for sure but it is getting worse with age like i truly never know what is gonna be on the other end of any given phone call she called me last year and she goes hey i just wanna start by saying im okay im like jax was like im going in the other room this is gonna be a while she said well it had just finished raining and i decided to drive to the cemetery to check on our family plot i was like normally thats the one place you dont have to worry about well you would think but its a good thing i drove down there cause when i pulled up i noticed a fresh mound of dirt on our family plot so i got out of the car to get a closer look and as im walking i realize that some stranger had been buried in our family plot i was like oh i did not see that coming for sure she said i walked closer to see whose name was on the marker and when i got over there all of a sudden my foot fell through the grave i panicked i panicked because i realized that my foot was about to touch the casket i could not bear the thought of that so i jerked my foot out of that grave and when that happened i fell on the ground well while i was on the ground i realized i have fallen and i cant get up im like oh my god we have reached the life alert stage its worse than i thought she said i didnt have my phone on me i wasnt expecting to get out of the car i couldnt get up i didnt know what to do so i started to crawl across the cemetery why are you crawling across the cemetery well i thought i could crawl across the cemetery i could go over to the curb i could sit on the curb and from there i could hoist myself up well when i got to the curb i could not hoist myself up so i just sat there well apparently while this was happening there was a couple who was driving past the cemetery they looked over and they saw some thing covered in dirt crawling across the cemetery and they thought hmm i wonder what that is lets go check i said there is no world in which i am driving past a cemetery i look over and i see some thing covered in dirt crawling across the cemetery and im like hmm i wonder what that is lets go check that aint happening she said well they pulled in the cemetery and when they pulled up to me it turned out they were older than me they couldnt help me up so i asked to borrow their phone i said oh to call a friend no i called the fire department why you are not a cat in a tree she said hello this is ginger feimster fortune feimsters mother do not bring me into this i am in the cemetery and i have fallen and i cant get up can you please send someone to come get me up but whatever you do do not drive that large fire truck that would be so embarrassing and they said maam that is our only mode of transportation she said so all of a sudden here came this large fire truck barreling through the cemetery and then five firemen in full gear got out of the truck im like oh my god these poor firemen theyre just trying to eat a spaghetti dinner the alarm rings and theyre like lets go save some lives they put on pounds of gear they get in their fire truck they race across town risking their lives they pull into the cemetery and its just an old woman on a curb going she said one of them got behind me and just went boop and got me right up so that was my day i had one foot in the grave im like that is my mother ginger feimster so of course you can imagine when i met jax she was like what of that is in your dna im like wont it be fun to find out no im quirky too im definitely very quirky but ive learned to channel it into my performances now ive actually been doing this a lot longer than people realize i was not in like theater in school i was too busy lezzing out on the softball field but i actually got my start uh with performing at church which is not usually where you think of the arts but my very first musical ever was about jonah and the whale and no i was not the whale you assholes i was a sailor it was a very progressive united methodist church i had to throw jonah overboard for disobeying god and it was a lot of pressure you know my grandmas in the fourth pew the lords watching i didnt wanna go to church unless i knew it was show day and then i was like and a five six seven eight i brought a baton to church once and just started twirling it in front of the congregation but i was like i need to tie this in so i just started saying books of the bible i was like deuteronomy genesis thessalonians corinthians job i was a star pupil i was even in the kids choir i got all of the solos until my nemesis moved into town becky fucking johnson we were years old all the boys thought she was so cute and pretty and had the best personality and i thought she was a real bitch she made my life hell she was cute though but she challenged me to the solo and the choir director told the boys in our group that they could pick the winner thank you so i decided i was gonna watch the adult choir and i would just emulate the women from the adult choir not realizing that im and theyre former opera singers so my very first audition i sang this ♪ oh lord my god ♪ ♪ when i in ♪ ♪ awesome wonder ♪ ♪ consider all thy works ♪ ♪ thy hands hath made ♪ a freakin shooin and then becky fucking johnson pulled out a boob got the part thats where i learned that this business is cutthroat baby even at church the competition continued into the kids handbell choir ooh it was very competitive we practiced every wednesday night for three hours no school credit no snacks no bathroom breaks one kid shit his pants and had to keep ringing like nothing happened were all smelling it like agh is this worth it but we hung in there cause once every three months we got to have a big performance in front of the entire congregation now they would line these bells up in order of size the smallest up here the biggest down here nobody wanted anything to do with these bells this was the melody these were the bass bells it was like playing the tuba the tuba sounds like youre playing farts blech gross but our choir director would only let the little skinny pretty girls like becky fucking johnson play these bells now i developed before everybody i was very tall my voice got deeper my hair was in a slickedback greasy ponytail i was rocking kitten heels and one sunday i decided to shoot my shot i said hey id like to get in on these bells down here ive been playing goalie and im ready to get in on the field coach i got big hands i

facebook i refriend my mom and i look to see if becky f johnsons life is still a living hell and all i can say is ♪ hallelujah ♪ ♪ hallelujah ♪ ♪ hallelujah hallelujah ♪ ♪ hallelu ♪ ♪jah ♪ ugh that is so petty oh my god i cannot be petty no i have a lot to be grateful for truly i cannot be petty i am so grateful that my life has unfolded the way it has i couldve never guessed this im so grateful that i met jax um shes the best whoo jax and i took our next big step together um no not kids we actually bought a house together uh which was very exciting a very adult thing to do and jax is the exact person you wanna do this kind of adult decision with shes very responsible she asks all the right questions she was like you know hows the roof uh whats the plumbing like is there mold im like yeah yeah yeah um and uh i dont know are there ghosts she looked at me like i was crazy im like thats a valid question because when i was home i ghosts were on my mind theres these houses in my hometown built in the and a lot of ghost sightings have happened there i dont know what it is about ghosts in the uh the is a very popular time for ghosts im just saying you dont see a lot of ghosts in daisy dukes so people have been spotting these ghosts so much that theyve become very casual about it in a way that im not used to so i was having lunch with my mom and her friends and my mom said you know i went to the tates house a couple of weeks ago i went upstairs to use the bathroom and when i came out of the bathroom there was catherine i said whos catherine she goes well shes dead and shes a ghost and all of her friends go mmhmm she said catherine grew up in that house she lived there her whole life never got married never had kids she died in that house and then when the tates moved in there was catherine she was in the den the living room the kitchen outside of the bathroom its just catherine i said so catherine just comes with the house her friend goes yep i saw her a couple of weeks ago she looked great so hearing about catherine made me think about the house that i grew up in it made me think about the house jax and i were looking at and it was just on my mind now ive never seen a ghost im more of an energy person it sounds very la to be like im an empath but when i was growing up in this house that i grew up in it was built in the it had such a weird energy to it i could never pinpoint what that was um i just felt so unsafe in that house i would make my dad sit outside of my bedroom until i fell asleep and i would catch him trying to crawl out of the bedroom like my mom in the cemetery and i was like dad im scared so he didnt sleep for a year and a half and then he and my mom divorced i think cause he just wanted to take a nap and get the hell outta that house so as my punishment i became my moms husband now when i was in high school she got that rich boyfriend i was telling you about and she would go there on the weekends and i would be there by myself so scared i slept with a knife under my bed not my cakecutting knife a different one and hearing about catherine this all comes up and i said mom you know the house that we grew up in that house had such a weird energy my mom said that house was the most haunted house i have ever lived in you mean the house you left me in alone when i was a teenager i had to i was scared i said what did you hear well when i was there i would hear footsteps at night going up and down the stairs you and your brothers were asleep i would hear door slams screams that thing was evil you shouldve told me i wouldve gone to my grandmothers house your grandmothers house was the second most haunted house i have ever been in your grandfather has been floating around there since but whatever was in our house was so evil that i said to it one night if you do not leave im gonna call the duke university paranormal department i dont know if thats an ivy league ghostbusters or what that is she said but i did not wanna fool with it i decided to put our house on the market and then she started whispering but i did not disclose that there was a ghost and that house has been sold every five years ever since so i believe evil still lurks within now a couple of months ago i was in chicago for a show and the night before i was leaving a restaurant and this man stops me and he goes i have something weird to ask you i said oh man i am about to touch a wiener he said i think my good friend lived in your childhood home and he asked me the address i said that is my childhood home i said can i ask you a weird question i said did your friend ever say if that house was haunted he said my friend said that was the most haunted house hes ever lived in in his entire life and he and his family moved out after six years so evil does lurk within thats why im saying if youre buying a house do not be afraid to ask about ghosts and if the disclosures say the roof is from theres new plumbing oh and catherine will join you at the table dont buy that house but im happy to say that jax and i have been in this house now for over a year and so far no ghosts uh so im very excited about that thank you you guys really get me but there is one thing that i wanted to do in this house now in this journey to where im at now its been about years in los angeles and it took me a really long time to to get traction to to work to be successful and during that time of working hard and not getting anywhere i would daydream about one day if im lucky enough to work to make money to buy a home there is something i am going to put in that house and that will be the symbol of success and i didnt know where this idea came from but i will tell you guys that six months ago i installed my very own industrial crushedice machine i made it baby the only problem is that now my mom wants to move in with us which would in fact make our house haunted i said why dont you just come over for slushies instead she goes well i think at the very least that we should in february for mine and jaxs birthday the three of us should go on a cruise you pay i said mom i love you but i would rather go back to the maldives wearing crocs rainbow shorts and a cutoff tee that just says dyke that aint happening thank you guys so much thank you for being here seattle youre the best someone wanted to know how you feel about my current material involving you um ive been your material for a long time mmhmm and i havent gotten any revenue\n"

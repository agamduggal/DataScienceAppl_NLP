        "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
        "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
        "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
        "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",

months ago ive been doing standup comedy for years yeah thank you thank you thank you my agent said to me anthony years is a major accomplishment for any comedian you gotta celebrate pick some of your favorite cities go perform for them and i said no thank you id rather go to milwaukee but look i am excited to be here tonight ive got great news after years of standup comedy just last weekend i finally perfected my act dont get me wrong i thought it was perfect before ran into an audience member after my show last saturday who told me different last saturday night im doing a show in new york after my set im trying to get out to the car a woman from the audience chases me down practically tackles me she says anthony that last joke you told tonight your closer ive gotta tell you that joke is problematic you need to think about it and you need to change it so i changed it and now its my opener so what im gonna do is im gonna tell you that joke explain what happened with that woman and then nail home the point that im the best now as a comedian ive got a responsibility a responsibility that i take very seriously the responsibility to get up in front of a group of strangers and give you my opinion on the trans community yeah thats right look guys youve got to do it now its in the handbook now i feel i feel like the trans community are the new pregnant women just in that it is never polite to guess guys youve got to trust me on this you never you never want to be like hey how far along are you are you going to keep it or no no dont do that even if youre right its rude do what i do im smooth with it i dont ask the question if i want to find something out i just offer you a drink here have this glass of bourbon and if they say actually anthony im seven months pregnant then i get to be like oh my god you look amazing but if they take the drink theyre trans now obviously obviously thats a closer i could leave right now itd be fine but this woman grabs me starts arguing with me she says anthony ive gotta ask you what is your intention with that trans joke i said well my intention is to make trans people laugh i mean could you imagine that would be historic and she says well anthony anthony youre probably not even aware of this but the problem with your joke is some trans people are insecure about the fact that they cant have kids of their own and your joke makes it sound like youre saying the opposite of a pregnant woman is a trans woman and that could be hurtful and i agree that could be hurtful but not coming from me you see i love trans people i empathize with the trans community im not trans myself but i too am always getting yelled at for walking into the wrong bathroom i love trans people you know what i hate pregnant women i mean fuck those chubby bitches am i right they shouldnt be allowed to play sports now look look i will admit i will admit that was a learning moment for me before that woman grabbed me i didnt know that trans people hated pregnant women as much as i do makes me respect them all the more so just in case anyone here tonight is trans and you were offended by my first joke heres a joke i tailor wrote just for you to enjoy last week i saw a pregnant woman get hit by a bus or as i like to call it a gender reveal party what are you guys laughin at thats not for you thats just for my trans friends dont like pregnant women dont like kids one of my friends just asked me if i would be the sperm donor for her baby i said i dont know thats a pretty big decision how old is your baby if youre walkin in late i hate kids i hate them so much its my whole thing and what surprises me is now that im getting older ive got friends family members having kids of their own and i dont judge throw your life away what surprises me is these people will text me pictures of their kids anthony will want to see this send i never want to see that the only time a kid shows up on my phone and im happy about it amber alert otherwise otherwise do not get my hopes up i used to ignore those texts from my friends pretend i didnt see em never respond then my sister had a kid started getting mad at me shed be like really anthony no response you got nothing to say about this picture of your beautiful niece fucking up finger painting so i came up with a plan now anytime anytime anyone texts me a picture of their kids i write back the exact same response thanks gonna save this one for later yup no that works you guys can use that it works i havent heard from my sister in a year its the best mmhmm like a lot of people i spent most of the pandemic stuck inside starin at the walls goin crazy i started buyin weird shit online decided i was gonna redecorate my place i dont know anything about interior design but i know what i like so i went on ebay and i paid for a childs coffin i thought thisll be great its vintage you put that in your living room its a conversation starter you know but like so many of the things we bought online during the pandemic i regret it now thing finally showed up in the mail empty i know i know look guys guys guys i hate kids so goddamn much i cant talk to kids these days the other day my little nephew came up to me he said uncle anthony ive been getting bullied by another kid in school i said dont put up with that break his nose hell leave you alone he said uncle anthony thats toxic masculinity well i wasnt gonna put up with that listen you guys came out here to have a good time on a saturday night i know what you want you want to talk politics lets go let me tell you whats wrong with this country let me tell you what the problem is with the united states of america in this country youve gotta be years old to drive a car right that makes sense but youve gotta be years old to be considered an adult to vote i think thats fucked up i think if youre old enough and mature enough to safely drive a car on the street then i should be allowed to have sex with you right anyway thats the only problem with this country now as of this weekend ive been on tour with this material for months and my favorite thing about touring around the country with these jokes the past months has been telling that last joke in the south guys i have learned so much about this great country of ours right at the beginning of this tour months ago i was doing a show in alabama told them that joke guy in the audience stands up and says anthony i hate to break it to you but the age of consent in alabama is so you gotta change that i said oh yeah you got to change that and then a couple of weeks later i did a show in mississippi told them that joke then told them about alabama guy in the audience stands up and says in mississippi the age of consent is and i said holy shit thats perfect i mean that is what the founding fathers were all about you know i have a friend who works for the fbi he pretends to be a girl goes on the internet and chats with child molesters all day i dont know what he does for the fbi but its gotta be i feel like the big new thing i keep hearing more and more about these days is porn addiction i feel like every time i turn around someone is complaining about their porn addiction not me i can handle my shit but a couple of months ago im at a family reunion big jeselnik family reunion everyone is there and the very first night were all in this giant ballroom eating dinner together as a family when my cousin stands up hes years old he says i have an announcement to make i just want to tell you all that ive been suffering from a porn addiction and its terrible but im doing my best to get over it no one in my family knows what to say generations of jeselniks are just staring straight ahead trying to eat their dinner so i stood up i said hey man we can watch something else look i can put the game on if you want but whens the next time were all gonna be together you know i dont have a porn addiction i watch a healthy amount of porn ive got my favorites hell i was in a bar the other night saw my favorite porn star of all time sitting at the end of the bar by herself i couldnt believe it i called the bartender over man ill have another beer and see that girl down there she shouldnt be here shes now this is where audiences traditionally start to complain theyll say anthony why do you have so many jokes about abusing children and why do you do them all in the beginning and this is where i kind of have to stop the show for a minute and i explain to the audience the concept of gallows humor gallows humor is what im all about gallows humor is when you see something in the world that is so horrible that you have to laugh at it otherwise it would destroy you a couple of months ago im reading the newspaper and i come across an article about a priest in my hometown who just got arrested for molesting an altar boy at the exact same church where i was an altar boy growing up that was horrifying to read that couldve been me if i had become a priest we like to have fun im proud to say that ive never once in my entire life paid money to have sex with a prostitute and ill tell you this they get so mad you know theres one thing i like about milwaukee and there is one thing i like about milwaukee seems like a safe place to live yeah maybe not to you but compared to where i live in los angeles oh my god this is paradise my neighborhoods really gone to shit in the past couple years gotten dangerous the other day a woman in my neighborhood was walking her dog had the dog stolen from her at gunpoint now its my dog i actually do love it here in milwaukee i enjoy any time i get to come and perform one of the alltime great standup comedy towns milwaukee yeah it cheers me up to be back in milwaukee ill tell you that ive needed cheering up lately too ive been a little down lately ill admit it lost a friend recently stupid friend of mine went to the hospital for an elective surgery a simple breast reduction surgery did not survive the surgery died right there on the operating table as far as im concerned yeah somehow thats become one of the most polarizing jokes im gonna tell all night and if you didnt laugh at it thats okay but what the fuck do you know ive been doing this for years and ill be honest i had no idea it had been years before my agent told me i never thought of years as a goal i should be trying to achieve ive never defined success by longevity ive always defined success by how long has it been since i had to have a roommate yeah its true i havent had a roommate in years im thats not a flex last roommate i ever had last roommate i ever had he had a video of every single person hed ever had sex with in our apartment yeah its a betrayal of trust but it was hilarious he had no idea another way i define success as an artist how long has it been since i had to have a day job again years i hated the day jobs i had to have coming up imagine what i was like at a day job years ago i had this one day job someone kept stealing my lunch someone stole my lunch every single day even though i clearly had my name written on it and i was pretty sure i knew who did it i just couldnt prove it so one day before work i crushed up an entire bottle of laxatives enough laxatives to cripple a man and i put them in my food and then i waited until this guy got up to go to the bathroom and as soon as he did i shit all over his desk yeah i got fired from most of my day jobs all of them really all of them except the last one last day job i ever had i worked in a giant soulless corporate office building and i quit in the middle of the day after i watched a woman accidentally step into an empty elevator shaft and plummet stories to her death i just walked right the fuck out and that was my last day in elevator repair if theres one thing im getting sick of after years of standup comedy its the travel i always say i do the shows for free you pay me to travel and that is certainly true tonight two nights ago i fly from new york city to milwaukee twoandahalfhour flight its direct it should be easy i get on the plane the woman sitting next to me has a dog curled up in her lap and i say excuse me but what the fuck is this this woman i swear to god she rolls her eyes at me and she goes uh this is my emotional support animal i have a note from my doctor i was like note from your doctor do you really need an emotional support animal on this flight and she goes no and i thought my head was going to explode i dont like when people take advantage of the system like that its a twoandahalfhour flight i talked to her about it im happy to report by the time we landed she needed that fucking dog air travel has gotten so uncomfortable in the past few years but everyone i know who flies a lot like i do they always have a little trick everyones got their own unique trick to make flying easier for them like im friends with a very wealthy married couple theyre millionaires and they got six kids in between the two of em theyre always flying off on some exotic family vacation and whenever they fly their trick is the family flies on two separate airplanes that way worstcase scenario one of those planes crashes they dont have to deal with their kids anymore uhhuh but look if im being honest with you guys if im being honest i dont actually have any married friends i used to used to have a lot of married friends but all my married friends have gotten divorced in the past two years all of them but ive noticed something all my friends divorces they all had two things in common infidelity and me hey listen all right listen you guys have been great so far i hate to do this to you but this next joke is gonna be too smart for the crowd dont worry i will explain it to you and after all arent those the best jokes sigmund freuds mom mustve been so fucking hot okay get that a lot of you were faking it for the cameras let me explain dr sigmund freud the most famous psychoanalyst of all time his main theory his main claim to fame was the theory that every young man wanted to murder his own father and have sex with his own mother imagine imagine how hot his mom must have been for his colleagues to go publish that i was years old when i walked in on my parents having sex thats a big moment for any young man that moment when you realize your parents are more than just mom and dad theyre also swingers yeah that was a core memory for sure never forget that ill never forget the night of my senior prom night of my senior prom im years old im at home putting on my tuxedo when my dad walked in the room and he handed me a condom snuck it to me in a handshake so fuckin gross then he looks me right in the eyes and he says anthony do you have any questions i said yeah dad do you have one thats still in the wrapper yeah my dad was fuckin weird okay all your dads are weird when youre a kid you cant recognize how weird your parents are its not until you get older that you figure it out like when i was a little kid every year on my birthday my dad would take me into the kitchen put me up against the kitchen wall and make a little mark to measure my girth mm and maybe that messed me up a little bit i dont know i feel like im a pretty normal guy although i do get angry when people try to talk to me about sex i was having lunch with a friend the other day and he says anthony ive been havin trouble with premature ejaculation i said oh yeah why dont you try talkin about baseball he said anthony dont you mean thinking about baseball and i said i dont give a fuck what you think about just dont talk to me about your premature ejaculation when i was growin up i had a sibling rivalry with my little brother got out of hand to be quite honest one day my little brother went into the backyard took my dogs collar off and let it run away from home so i poisoned his fish i think i won that one cause the next day i went out and i found my dog put his collar back on brought him back home but my brother he died from the salmon yeah its a banger last year my parents lost all of their money in a ponzi scheme so of course they came to me their wealthy successful son and asked me why i did that mm mm yeah my family didnt have a lot of money when i was growin up my dad was a volunteer firefighter do you know what a volunteer firefighter is it is exactly like a regular firefighter except your son does not respect you my moms been having a hard time shes gettin paranoid in her old age cant sleep at night cause she gets too scared so every night around bedtime she calls me to complain on the phone for hours that shes too afraid to fall asleep in her own home so finally after months of this just to get her off my back i bought her a gun and now shes scared about that she said anthony whats the matter with you dont you know that people who live with a gun are more than twice as likely to be shot in their own home i said mom i am counting on it and look maybe maybe im being too harsh i have trouble sleeping sometimes too like the other night the other night im lying in bed and i cannot fall asleep im just staring out my bedroom window for hours and i swear i saw my nextdoor neighbor murder his wife in their kitchen then dispose of the body in garbage bags now im worried im next like i dont think he saw me but he sure as shit heard me clappin now heres a joke i like a lot my cousin randy is maybe the dumbest person ive ever met in my entire life dumbest guy ive ever met the other day he comes up and he goes anthony check out my new tattoo its the japanese symbol for awesome no randy thats a swastika i mean fuck man everybody knows everybody knows thats the german symbol for awesome now i said i liked that joke a lot heres how much i like that joke i used to open with it right at the beginning of this tour months ago kanye west came to one of my shows i had no idea he was even there i didnt find out until the next day when kanye went on a podcast and he said i went to go see anthony jeselnik last night and his opening joke is so high level that it made me realize im not funny guys that blew my mind thats the best compliment ive ever gotten in my life i humbled kanye west you know yeah im not gonna lie i was so excited i watched that clip times i sent it to my manager i said put this on my website put it on social media lets sell some fucking tickets with a little help from kanye and my manager says to me anthony are you out of your goddamn mind dont you know whats been going on with kanye lately and i said no honestly i used to be a huge kanye fan but i stopped paying attention to him when he went christian and my manager says well in the past two weeks alone kanyes been wearing white lives matter tshirts and saying wild antisemitic shit and i was like oh he went super christian that crazy son of a bitch finally finished the whole book my manager said look anthony you can use this clip of kanye to promote yourself if you want to but if you do you gotta drop that swastika joke you gotta stop doing it for sure otherwise youre gonna start to attract the wrong kinds of fans and your current fans will take the wrong lesson from what youre doing and thats how much i like that joke im against cancel culture thank you thats my impression of a shit comic trying to get on rogan in years of standup comedy ive been asked the same questions over and over and over again the question i get asked the most by far is anthony what do you think about cancel culture does it make you mad arent you scared what do you think about cancel culture so let me be clear i dont give a fuck about cancel culture what i am sick of are comedians complaining about cancel culture its not that hard do your job comedians are supposed to be unparalleled badasses i know this because i have a fucking mirror cancel culture is not scary its also not interesting and its definitely not new back when i was in college i had this crazy professor made all of his students fill out their own suicide note then he would read them out loud to the rest of the class as soon as the parents found out he got fired immediately and i was the only one who stood up for him because hey he made math fun and yes i did mention joe rogan guys do not get me wrong i like joe joes my friend joes a good guy but if you listen to his podcast youre a fucking loser my brotherinlaw is joe rogans biggest fan never misses an episode doesnt think four hours is long enough but my brotherinlaw is joe rogans target demographic my brotherinlaw is a conspiracy theorist a crazy conspiracy theorist like my brotherinlaw refuses to become an organ donor because he swears that if you get into an accident and the paramedics see that youre an organ donor they wont try to save your life cause they want to use your organs to help someone else its insane but i cant argue with him hes a paramedic another question ive been asked a million times in the last years anthony whats your favorite joke youve ever written its easy the first one twenty years ago when i started this i started from nothing i was nothing i was just going around to open mics in los angeles performing for bitter openmic comedians who never reacted to anything i was just trying to find my voice could i be good at this could i make it a living and it took a while until one night i went to a coffee shop tried this joke out for the first time changed my whole life i said guys my girlfriend loves to eat chocolate shes always eating chocolate and she likes to joke shes got a chocolate addiction hmm keep me away from those chocolate bars im addicted to em and its really annoying so one day i put her in the car and i drove her downtown and i pointed out a crack addict and i said do you see that honey why cant you be that skinny and i will never forget telling that joke for the very first time to a room full of bitter openmic comedians who never reacted to anything and the whole room just went ooh i was like oh im gonna be a fucking star and then of course a couple years later i got my big break and i got to do some roasting got to roast donald trump charlie sheen roseanne barr all the greats people still ask me anthony which one was your favorite charlie sheen but not because of charlie sheen i didnt give a fuck about charlie sheen i remember a couple days before that roast im at home writing jokes and i get a phone call from the network and they say anthony i know you only have a couple days left to write but we just added mike tyson to the dais will you be able to write yourself any jokes about mike tyson two days later i am walking into that roast with jokes about mike tyson i am so excited and right as i go to sit down guy from the network comes back he goes im just doublechecking with you you dont have any mike tyson rape jokes do you and i said why and he said well it was almost impossible to get mike tyson to agree to appear on a televised roast we had to promise him there would be no rape jokes i was like are we talking about the same mike tyson so now the roast has begun im up at the podium cameras are rolling i have zero jokes about mike tyson and i am mad about it but out of the corner of my eye i can see mike tyson sitting on the stage mikes been drinkin mikes been smokin mikes laughing at everything mikes responding to jokes that arent even about him mike tyson was having the time of his life so i think you know what i can do one so i said i think mike tysons biggest problem is mike never had a strong male role model growing up mikes dad walked out on the family very early on after mike raped him now as soon as i tell this joke as soon as i tell this joke i regret it i am afraid and i turned to look at mike tyson to see is he coming at me am i about to die and i just see mike tyson throw his head back and he goes he got you charlie guys in years of standup comedy ive gotten to meet so many famous people havent given a fuck about any of em except for one and that was norm macdonald yeah yeah all right long before i ever even considered becoming a comedian i worshiped norm macdonald he was my hero when i was a kid hes still my hero today never got to meet him for the longest time then a couple years ago i get a phone call from my agent he says anthony how would you like to be the new host of last comic standing and i said why the fuck would i want to do that that show sucks and he said this year its gonna be different this year they have norm macdonald as a judge would you like to work with norm and i signed up on the spot norm and i made eight episodes of this tv show together eight straight nights of eighthour tapings every night and for the first four episodes norm macdonald and i do not get along at all we get into fights every night on the air we get into fights every night backstage we flatout do not like each other and its killing me hes my hero and the only reason i took this job so for those first four episodes i am working at it and im working at it hard norms working at it too just not nearly as hard but after four episodes for whatever reason something clicks finally norm and i are laughing together were getting along all i ever wanted after the show was finally finished norm and i had to go and promote it and the last time i ever saw norm macdonald we are backstage at larry king im getting interviewed first and then norm right before i go out norm says to me hey anthony i know we havent always gotten along or seen eyetoeye but if youre up for it and you trust me i thought of something really funny that you and i could do together i said oh my god norm of course youre my hero tell me what you want to do he says i think itll be funny if instead of promoting the show by talking about these other comedians why dont you and i just promote the show by publicly insulting each other he says dont even try to be funny anthony just be mean and i said you know what norm i can do that i sit down with larry king larry says anthony what you think about norm macdonald and i said larry norm macdonald is a piece of shit and i can hear norm laughing backstage i finish the interview i go backstage norm is still laughin he says anthony that was perfect now watch this norm sits down with larry king larry king says norm what do you think about anthony jeselnik norm says larry hes one of the greats ive never been more pissed off in my entire life cant believe i fell for that you have been an amazing crowd today im going to leave you all with this this is my new closer dont worry it is transproof about a month ago i went to a wedding craziest wedding ive ever seen after the ceremony every single person there took molly the bride took molly the groom took molly the parents the grandparents every single person there was on molly craziest shit ive ever seen i blacked out around midnight woke up the next morning in a fucking hammock somewhere went and found the bride and groom and i was like hey guys did i do anything embarrassing last night and they said yeah anthony you spiked the punch with molly thank you very much milwaukee have a great night thank you\",\n          \"ellen degeneres for your approval is less a comedy special and more an hourlong ego massage for the embattled host what should have been a triumphant farewell instead feels like a poorly executed pr stunt filled with tired drawnout jokes and forced selfdeprecation ellen spends much of the special rehashing controversies surrounding her toxic workplace allegations but instead of addressing them meaningfully she spins these moments into awkward jokes coming across as defensive rather than introspective the comedy itself is uninspired and stale with tired observations about things like car troubles pigeons and aging that feel recycled from better comics the pacing is atrocious dragging on for what feels like an eternity with ellen stretching out weak material well beyond its comedic lifespan her attempts to balance humor with personal reflection fall flat making it seem more like shes fishing for sympathy rather than offering genuine entertainment whats most striking is the clear disconnect between ellen and her audience the packed crowd of adoring fans seems willing to laugh at anything she says but the comedy is hollow with ellen relying on her celebrity status rather than delivering anything truly funny or meaningful its painfully obvious that this special exists not because she has anything new to say but because she needs to reclaim some positive attention after her tarnished reputation for your approval is a disappointing selfserving finale that highlights how out of touch ellen has become for anyone hoping for a strong farewell from a comedy icon this special is a huge letdown if this is ellens swan song its a sour note to go out on if you have never seen ellen do standup live you are in for a treat tonight two minutes her first appearance on network television would you welcome ellen degeneres wouldnt it be great if we could pick up the phone and call up god and ask yeah hi god this is ellen ellen degeneres degeneres wwhats so funny i never thought of that it does sound like that doesnt it my grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was shes today we dont know where the hell she is ellen is on the fast track shes one of the top female comedians on television ellens new sitcom is a certifiable topten hit the real ellen is putting all that success and fame at risk susan im gay more than million people watched her comingout episode why did you think it was necessary for you to come out because its okay ellen finds herself at the center of a storm of controversy being accused of going too far too gay when life gets you down you know what you gotta do  just keep swimming swimming swimming  she may have pulled off one of the greatest comebacks of all time the ellen show has become one of the most popular shows in the world praised for delivering a daily dose of joy with its unique mix of dancing games talk and millions of dollars in audience giveaways spreading laughter seems to be working well for the entertainer and comedian and shes showing no signs of slowing down a few years ago i started ending my show by saying be kind to one another heres the downside um i can never do anything unkind ever now ever breaking news tonight is the queen of nice  really the queen of mean respond to this with the most insane stories about ellen being mean shes not the happygolucky nice person ellen degeneres is under fire again with accusations of a toxic work environment toxic phony hypocrite liar things are spiraling ellen degeneres degeneres degeneres its a breaking story in the world of entertainment and this is great great news ellen is back although shes saying this new special will be her farewell thank you thank you thank you thank you so much it seems like you still care you know i used to say that i didnt care what other people thought of me i realize now looking back i said that at the height of my popularity if i look older than when you saw me last its because im older than when you saw me last and also i stopped doing botox and filler yeah i used to do botox back when i didnt care what other people thought of me thats when i did it such a waste of time to worry about what people think of us just a waste of energy were just guessing we dont know its impossible to know what people are thinking i walk out here tonight and im hoping that youre thinking this is marvelous im so happy to be here that is my hope but well good but some of you could be thinking lets see how this goes some of you may be thinking why is she doing this does she owe back taxes im here because i love doing standup i miss doing standup and i like making people happy and i do care what people think we all care what people think we can say we dont we can pretend we dont care all it takes is trying to parallel park in front of a crowded outdoor caf\\u00e9 spot looks big enough you line it up the way you always do you pull in cut it a little too close youre scraping the hubcap the entire way along the curb making a very loud noise put it in drive pull out try it again now youve overcompensated youre sticking so far out youre blocking traffic in that lane now you have a decision to make do you have the confidence to pull out and do it right this time or do you do that backandforth backandforth backandforth inching your way to the curb knowing how long thats gonna take and people are watching the deep shame you feel when you give up and drive away even if youre meeting someone you say im so sorry i couldnt make it and theyre like you did i was sitting there i was watching you i started the chant its funny how we can be embarrassed all by ourselves in a car all by ourselves for anything just any stupid reason like even if we just cant figure out how to turn our windshield wipers off which to me is one of the most embarrassing things is driving a car when its not raining and the windshield wipers are going and its because someone decided to add a random one we had the windshield wiper situation was fine we had the fast mode for when its raining heavily medium light and then someone decided were just gonna wash away the rain once in a while we dont need to see all the time and its always a surprise cause you think the rain has stopped youve turned it off and youre driving along and five minutes later you see this thing like then youre trying to fiddle with it trying to turn it off and you dont know how cause its always different sometimes its on the end of the lever on the steering wheel sometimes theres a lever within the lever the baby lever like the lever had a baby and its inside the lever right there tiny baby lever you dont trust it cause youre just waiting even if its not going youre like its gonna go again i know it i feel it and then finally it does and then you feel pretty confident about it then you catch the rearview mirror your back ones been on the whole time yeah thats what you did you turned that one on you turn that off turn everything back on again you have to sell your car theres so many extraneous things in a car we dont need for instance i have never used my parking brake ive never parked my car and thought i want it more parked than this there are things you need the seat adjustments scoot forward lean back you need those then theres that one button that inflates the back of the seat the one that makes you feel like youre getting spooned by a pregnant woman oh boy ooh all right apparently its for lumbar support got to support your lumbar you got to its all any of us knows about the lumbar its got to be supported you dont get support for your lumbar any place other than your car you dont even hear about the lumbar anyplace else bill whats wrong whats happening its my damn lumbar i havent been driving enough lately mm thats how you walk when your lumbar is out there are buttons in my car ive never used never will use theres a button with squiggly lines next to a misshapen peanut i dont know ive never touched it im fine theres a button with tally marks next to a sideways yarmulke what the hell dont get me started on the dashboard lights too the dashboard lights are not illuminated all the time so when they are it must mean something serious right but check engine thats vague ive checked it its there i shouldnt have to guess from an exclamation point between two parentheses that my tire pressure is low but if my windshield wiper fluid is low all the words windshield wiper fluid low oh my god pull over just cause i dont know my buttons doesnt mean im stupid just means im not interested were all interested in different things all good at different things i was talking to someone and they said i dont know how you get on stage i could never do that i said well i dont know how you dryclean clothes clean clothes dryly and then you martinize on top of that some of you are in your twenties you dont know what martinizing is no its not my job to explain it to you also i dont know and i never have yeah none of us do let me catch you up on whats been going on with me since you saw me last i got chickens yeah thank you i love them so very much chickens are the best bird to have at home i think so a lot of people think parrots but theyre so gossipy you have to be really careful what you say around them chickens will never talk they have little personalities ive always wanted chickens now i have them theyre so cute they see me they recognize me when i walk towards them and they run to me i put a swing in there for them and they get on a swing chicken on a swing thats ridiculous i have a bench in there and i go sit there and they sit on my lap and i pet them and they fall asleep and they give me an egg every day they lay an egg every day as someone who hosted a daily talk show i can really appreciate that yeah yeah im sure theyre thinking i just laid an egg i dont think i can do that again tomorrow and yet they do theyre curious little animals too theyre very curious hey you know how people always ask why did the chicken cross the road i think i know now that i have chickens its their innate sense of adventure im sorry to be just another comedian going on and on about her chickens another thing about chickens is that um they they fly people think theyre flightless birds and that is not true they do fly the longest recorded chicken flight is seconds isnt that amazing someone thought to time that yeah also chickens dream scientists have discovered that chickens dream now listen i love animals more than anyone but we could take scientists working on chicken dreams and move them on over to climate change im not saying that chicken dreaming is not worth studying it is but we dont need our top minds on it i dont think i am curious what do they dream about probably the same things we do probably flying but or seconds for them you know mm thats all for chickens yeah got to save some for the memoir yeah yeah yeah yeah let me see what else i can tell you about that has been going on chickens oh yeah i got kicked out of show business yeah yeah thanks yeah cause im mean yeah you cant be mean and be in show business no theyll kick you out no mean people in show business im out yeah yall heard i was mean everybody heard that i was mean everywhere i go i know everyones heard that im mean i know when i walk into a restaurant people are watching waiting to see if ill be mean do you think shell be mean first and then dance look she oh shes reaching for butter i thought she was gonna hit somebody all right im gonna eat you watch now that was a big story huh that had some legs on it the first i heard about it i i came across a headline that said how ellen degeneres became the most hated person in america now i didnt see the other names on the ballot but i have to yeah its its an impressive title it really is its a its a horrible thing to say about somebody and to make it worse there was no trophy no awards banquet nothing just the title just you know i made a sash at home and i wore that around just to to feel like i had something you know it was quite a shock to me because for years there were all these polls basically saying i was one of the most trusted people in the country there was a poll that asked people which celebrity would you most want to babysit your child and i was the number one answer because when you think good with kids you immediately think childless lesbian standup comedian once they heard that i might be mean they didnt want me to babysit anymore so it wasnt all bad no i was in therapy for a while trying to deal with all the hatred coming at me and it was not a common situation for a therapist to deal with my therapist said ellen where do you get this idea that everyone hates you and i said well um new york times washington post entertainment weekly us weekly i think elmo may have said something recently on an episode of sesame street she said you just need to avoid looking at the news just avoid media and i was like i am im not looking at anything i would know when something was going on because id start getting text from friends saying thinking of you or sending love and id be like oh why do i need love sent the be kind girl wasnt kind that was the headline heres the problem im a comedian who got a talk show and i ended the show every day by saying be kind to one another yeah i know it seemed like a good idea but i became a brand a onedimensional character who gave stuff away and danced every day up steps do you know how hard it was to dance up steps would a mean person dance up steps i dont think so had i ended my show by saying go fuck yourselves people would have been pleasantly surprised to find out im kind i loved that show i loved everything about that show it was a family to me heres something sweet sixteen people who worked there started out straight and by the time they left were gay yeah you dont see jimmy kimmel doing those kind of numbers you know whats funny is that when i first came out people were afraid that watching my show would turn people gay which is ridiculous you have to work there you have to fill out a and then you turn gay we had so much fun together at that show we laughed all the time we played games all the time i started a game of tag in like that we played all the way till when the show ended cause i just loved playing games we played tag and i would chase people down the hallways i would chase them around the studio and scare them all the time i would jump out scare people cause i would love to do that and hearing myself say this out loud i realize i was chasing my employees and terrorizing them i can see where that would be misinterpreted well we had morning meetings every morning in my office the producers would come in writers would come in and wed talk about what we were gonna do on the show that day and andy lassner was one of my executive producers yeah uh andy is a very nervous man and he everything scares him he could drop his pen and it would startle him hes just a nervous man and alison was one of my writers who was scared of snakes anything snakerelated so sometimes before theyd come into my office we would hide rubber snakes in a panel in the ceiling and i had a button that i could push that would release the snakes down again hearing myself say this out loud but they liked it they did there are a lot of perks with having your own television show number one has to be the ability to say to someone we should have a panel in the ceiling that releases snakes and then another adult says yeah well get that started right away scaring was just a big component of the show we would you know we started with scaring guests and i dont remember exactly how it started it was some simple like i think chris hemsworth or some big strong guy that was on the show we found out was scared of crickets so we had someone dress as a cricket and sneak up behind his chair when he was talking and you know make a cricket noise and scare him and then it just escalated we just decided to make it more surprising to people and eventually we uh built a table that looked like the table between me and the guest but it was actually a box where someone could pop out and scare them but the guests got wise to that and if they saw that it was a box they would open it and look in the box so we built a tunnel under the stage that went into the box so that when they checked it it was empty and then theyd close it and somebody would crawl into the box from underneath i was a very immature boss i didnt want to be a boss i didnt go to business school i went to charlies chuckle hut it looked like i was the boss the show is called ellen and everybodys wearing tshirts that say ellen and there were buildings all over the warner bros lot that said ellen but i dont think that meant that i should be in charge i dont think that ronald mcdonalds the ceo of mcdonalds everything i knew about being a boss i learned from movies and those were things like saying jenkins my office now or the names frank how the hell are you but those were men bosses women bosses didnt come along for a while not till around the time of martinizing i think no but men bosses and women bosses are different like a woman boss couldnt say jenkins my office now a woman boss would have to use more words a woman boss would have to say something like excuse me jenkins i dont want to bother you if youre not too busy could you step into my office real quick i just have to talk to you for a second thank you so much cause women are raised in a different way at least i was i was raised to be a people pleaser i was taught when i was a little girl to be small and quiet and agreeable and its crazy what ive done with my life cause im exactly the opposite of how i was raised to be yeah most women arent raised with confidence we just arent were too selfconscious which is why you rarely see a woman playing air guitar i love how they make it like its hard like somethings happening there men can get away with acting out things that arent actually happening and not look crazy somehow a man in the middle of nowhere and for no reason can practice an imaginary golf swing just oh no im not in line im just waiting for my latte you go ahead menll jump up and see if they can slap the top of a doorframe ive never had that urge i wonder if i could hit that tiffany hold my purse im gonna give it a try i couldnt do it i didnt give me my purse i didnt do it good we have all these unwritten rules based on gender of acceptable behavior of who were allowed to be and how were allowed to act if we dont follow those rules it makes people uncomfortable when people get uncomfortable there are consequences for those of you keeping score this is the second time ive been kicked out of show business yeah kicked me out before cause i told them i was gay no gay people in show business no theyll kick you out cant be gay and be in show business eventually theyre gonna kick me out a third time for being old mean old and gay the triple crown i knew it was a risk to tell people i was gay cause i knew a lot of people didnt like gay people if they did we wouldnt have needed the parade listen we dont like all of you either but we dont make a big thing about it most of us get into this business because we didnt get enough love or attention as a child so we go into a business that depends on people liking us to be successful whats wrong with us for me it was never about the money it was about healing my childhood wounds i thought if i could make people happy then theyll like me and if they like me ill feel good about myself and all i can say about that is thank god for the money cause its a fickle business they liked me for a long time i was on a sitcom i made them laugh they liked me then i told them i was gay and they didnt like me then i got a talk show and i gave them tvs and cars and i danced and they liked me then they heard a rumor i was mean they didnt like me so its been a real test for my ego and my selfesteem because theres such extremes in this business there are people who love you and idolize you and then there are people who hate you just really loudly hate you so sometimes i long for my childhood when i just had good oldfashioned neglect what was wrong with that its been two years since the show ended and its been an adjustment because for years i drove onto the warner bros lot passed a giant billboard of my face so the first thing i did was i had a giant billboard of my face installed on my lawn so i saw that when i drove in yeah then i put an applause sign in the dining room and thats helping also but really ive only known myself working for years thats all ive done is work so i didnt really have a lot of free time and didnt have hobbies now theres a lot of free time so im trying to figure out what to do with that so i got the chickens remember i dont know if you yeah i decided to take up gardening cause everybody talks about gardening and how great gardening is its not no its really not i got the overalls and the tool belt and the hat i looked adorable i did but i find once you put the plants in the ground youre no longer gardening youre just waiting you know i tell people i grew these strawberries but at best i was just there when it happened its the sun and the sprinklers that should take the credit im more like the strawberries godmother showing up on its birthday look how big youre getting see you at christmas maybe it is relaxing to be out there though mainly cause the garden gloves make it impossible for me to look at my phone yeah sometimes ill put the garden gloves on and go inside and lay down yeah its just as relaxing really my garden gloves and my sweatpants i live in sw when im at home i just wear sweatpants i dont understand people who dont just wear sweatpants at home like whats the point you know yeah i take off my goingout clothes i take those off put on my stayinghome clothes once im in my sweatpants im not leaving not leaving the house a few weeks ago a friend of mine texted me and he said would you like to come over for a lastminute dinner party for mick as in jagger now ive never met mick jagger and i would love to meet mick jagger but i was in my sweatpants already and i was not leaving thats what i told him and he could not believe that was the reason i wasnt going i guess most people would make something up because it is a ridiculous reason and i know that but it was the truth you know and you know people say honesty is the best policy i dont know why they say that its only the best policy if its something you want to hear really like there are certain degrees of honesty if you tell someone theres something stuck in their teeth they dont love that but they kind of appreciate that and theyll take that but as soon as you tell someone that all of their stories should be shorter yeah you lose of their friendship is what happens people say its hard to tell the truth for me its hard not to tell the truth which is why it was really difficult for me to keep my sexuality a secret because i felt such guilt for not being honest about who i was i felt shame for how society was making me feel i felt fear for what would happen to my career if i did come out ultimately i decided its more important for me to be honest about who i am yeah yeah they say the truth will set you free and it did i was free for three years nobody would hire me truth will make you broke people lie so much these days they really do you can tell because they make such a big deal of it when theyre telling the truth theyll say things like well to tell you the truth or if im being honest if youre being honest i prefer it the other way around listen im gonna lie to you here that lasagna was phenomenal most people tell me that they appreciate my honesty because they know where they stand with me but someone did suggest that i get tested to see if im on the spectrum and uh im not on the spectrum and i wouldnt care if i was on the spectrum but im not well i am on the spectrum we all are its a spectrum im on the part of the spectrum where someone on the spectrum would have a problem with me saying im on the spectrum so yeah thats right but i may have ocd because a therapist said so and i said yes i am very organized because i thought that was the o i didnt know what ocd was i was raised in a religion christian science that doesnt acknowledge diseases or disorders so when i was growing up nobody talked about anything there was no discussion of anything i look back now and i realize my dad for sure had ocd he would check the doorknob times before we would leave he would check the faucet times he would unplug all the appliances before we left the house because lightning could strike and it would catch fire they say it could be hereditary so i went home and i asked portia i said do you think i may have ocd and she said yes you do barely got that sentence out really its funny ive never thought of myself as obsessive i think of myself as careful and everyone else careless and out of control i asked her what i obsess about and she said you obsess about time and that is true i dont like to be late i like to be on time so sometimes that makes us early this is the example she said i should share with you i um there are many but this is the one she said usher was having an afterparty for the grammys one year and we got there so early it was just us and the staff yup yup we helped place candles on tables i invoiced him these are my confessions i just dont know why the invitation says a certain time for a party to start and then everyone goes an hour or two later people seem to think that means means means means nothing to me cause im not going who starts something at anyway i obsess on time and uh i obsess on animals i know i obsess on animals cause i love them too much like way too much i think about how they see things and what they feel and what they think and i worry about butterflies in rainstorms and how delicate they are and how their little tiny feet are holding on to a blade of grass trying to winds blowing the rain is happening on their little tiny wings saturating their wings and their feet holding especially if its a butterfly what if its his first day and theyre like is this life this is horrible ooh i should have stayed a caterpillar the monarch butterfly think about that how crazy is that story you know the story i dont have to tell you but i will the little tiny caterpillar i mean how does it even make it past the caterpillar stage its a larva and then that somehow gets into a caterpillar and a caterpillar just and somehow it just knows instinctively its time for that part of its life to change thats done im gonna put myself into a chrysalis and then it turns into liquid somehow and then it becomes a butterfly flying for the first time and it looks drunk and confused the way they you know and they make it to mexico that way i dont know how the butterfly is beautiful and people talk about the butterfly but the butterfly wouldnt be the butterfly without the caterpillar i mean the deep knowing that that caterpillar has its only perspective is crawling on the ground and its looking at other crawling things saying im gonna fly someday and im gonna go to mexico and theyre like no youre not and whats mexico but i dont know if we really fully appreciate what that metamorphosis is the fact that its a caterpillar it knows to change and becomes this other thing entirely thats genius its brilliance and the octopus the octopus being able to change texture and shape and form and color instantaneously depending on what its on thats genius a colony of ants or of bees the way they communicate and theres no chaos between all of those things everything in nature is living up to its full potential but i am so disappointed in pigeons what happened to them i mean pigeons they have builtin gps in their beaks and they can fly for hundreds of miles in world war ii they saved lives they were taking messages from generals to other generals and saving lives there are pictures of them in the newspaper with medals not pinned but around their necks that they received for what they did in world war ii and now look at them just pecking at old gum in filthy alleyways and parking lots they could be anywhere i would feel sorry for them but they made a choice i mean they barely fly anymore they theyre just uh filthy and even if a car is coming they dont even fly to get out of the way all right okay all right okay all right okay okay all right okay sometimes it looks like theyre gonna do something important youll see a bunch and they all get up at once again that kind of communication all of them get up at once they fly and they just go in one big circle and they go right back to where they were god you guys not living up to their potential i rescued a pigeon one time ill rescue anything ive always tried to save animals my whole life but i saw a onelegged pigeon on the street near where i lived and i took it home because i knew it wasnt gonna make it on the street and i didnt know how to take care of it i mean never had a pigeon so i just threw gum and trash down dirt thinking thats what it eats you know because ive never seen it it didnt make it ill rescue anything i really will and if i see a sign of someone posting a cat or a dog missing when they post those pictures i will drive around and i will try to find that animal and its not just for the reward money its not no i rescued a dog one time i was driving and i see this dog all by itself and i get out of the car and its soaking wet im like oh my god what happened to you take it home dry it off stays with me for the night put out posters the next afternoon get a call from the people saying thank god where did you find it and i told them and they said thats where we live yeah they said we had just given it a bath and we put her on the lawn to dry out it was pretty close to the sidewalk when i saw it anyway i obsess on things i have add and i blame the talk show for that because for years i was talking to people in fiveminute segments when im at a party and someones talking to me longer than five minutes i have the urge to say im sorry we have to take a break parties are hard for me parties are very hard for me people are wanting to talk and stuff and they always talk about books theyre reading i dont read i want to i try to read but my add makes it really hard for me as much as i try to focus on the words i end up thinking about a sandwich i had earlier that day moby dick for me is two pages about a whale and pages about me wondering if i should grow my hair out or keep it short ive had it short for a while i should try to grow it out probably maybe to my shoulderlength or something like that not much longer than that i wonder how long that would take though i should probably keep it short i think thats better why not try something different though i should oh yeah oh its done yeah yeah my add makes it really hard for me to sit down and focus on anything at all like do you know how hard it was for me to put this together of course you dont why would i ask that question why do people ask people questions they know they dont have the answer to why do people say guess what i did yesterday do i have to is it a game is there a prize i dont want to youll never guess what i did yesterday youre right i wont i wont probably not unless its something really average like you had lunch you said ill never guess so its probably something weird like you got a chinchilla and named it stewart i dont know so its hard for me to focus and i get like when i was thinking about pigeons and how disappointed i was in them i was i remembered that i had rescued the pigeon cause id forgotten i was like yeah i rescued that onelegged pigeon and when i wrote down legged i did the hyphen thing and i thought legged or legged is it legged onelegged onelegged pigeon or onelegged its not one armmed you dont one armmed armed but its two gs so legged you dont go i begged for food no you dont stay i got mugged its legged or legged oneleg pigeon onelegged onelegged oneleg pigeon onelegged oneleg pigeon onelegged pigeon a oneleg onelegged oneleg pigeon onelegged pigeon so i have add i have ocd im losing my memory but i think im welladjusted because i obsess on things but dont have the attention span to stick with it then i forget what i was obsessing about in the first place so it takes me all the way around to being welladjusted i think yeah im very impatient that is a problem for me im very impatient its hard for me to live in the moment were supposed to live in the moment but every moment eh the spiritual teacher ram dass wrote a book called be here now id like to write one for people with add and call it yeah but whats that over there there are all these books out there telling us how to live telling us why were here cause why are we here really i mean obviously to gossip and make fun of each other on the internet but why else these things i think about now that im older im years old and i thank you thats how you know youre old you get the applause you dont get it when youre or even in your it starts around so i dont like the word old i think its a bad word it just sounds bad old is that bread still good no thats old old and i dont feel old the only time i feel old is when im in a restaurant trying to read a menu that is the only time i feel old yeah you know all the reasons its like too dark in there its always too dark and the way they think theyre gonna help they put a tealight candle on the table which does nothing i blow it out i just blow it out and oh okay youre gonna light it again all right im just gonna because it doesnt do anything thats why why are you lighting okay ill do it again im just gonna put it in my pocket how about that you cant see and if you put your flashlight on your phone to try to read the menu that just automatically says old thats just thats they should come with a sound effect when you put the flashlight on old it should just be old and even if you can see the print is so small i dont know who is printing these menus but the print is so tiny its like theyre using a jewelers loupe to make the font its tiny tiny font you cant read it im like can you see that does that say tortilla or trampoline what does that say to you i cant see anything yeah hi okay ill go ahead and order im gonna get the pasta with stem cells they have a childrens menu they should have a largerprint menu for older people with a bendy light so you can see it or even better they should come out in audiobook a menu could be an audio meryl streep reads the cheesecake factory pancakes i dont do impressions thats pancakes when youre this age the doctors start asking you to come in for checkups even though theres nothing wrong with you they just want to see you its a scam theyre just looking for stuff they ask you all kinds of personal stuff how many drinks per week do you have first of all its none of your business second of all im gonna lie to you here three drinks per week how about i start with per day before i do that math okay carry the two they just look for stuff my doctor said whens the last time you had a bone density test and i said a what bone density test i said ive never had a bone density test well at your age you should get one i said why im in good shape no you should get one at your age so i got the stupid bone density test im off the charts below it i have fullon osteoporosis i dont even know how im standing up right now im like a human sandcastle i could disintegrate in the shower i have to take that prolia shot every six months remember the commercial where the womans walking and a kid darts out on the skateboard or something whoa whoa thats me its hard to be honest about aging and seem cool hey if you got arthritis in your knee make some noise oh me too i just had excruciating pain one day and i thought i tore a ligament or something i got the mri and theyre like no its just arthritis i said howd i get that he goes it just happens at your age all these things just happen at your age its around the time you start watching wheel of fortune yeah theres no buildup you just find yourself sitting there enjoying it one day thats a pretty gown vannas wearing the prizes are tricky on there i find i think they really are i had a conversation about this the other day if you land on the dollar amount the or the you get that right but if you land on the car honk honk half a car by the way youre trying to land on the million dollars thats what you want but the million dollars is sandwiched in between two bankrupts if you freezeframe it youll notice that the bankrupts are a little bit larger than the sliver of the million dollars youll see when you freezeframe it its just when you land on it youre like i got a million dollars but no you dont you have to have so many other things that line up to get that which i was telling myself when portia walked in and said who are you talking to another thing that happens when you age you just start talking to yourself id probably be doing this exact same thing right now if you werent here aging is very interesting aging is tough on its own but aging then you have aging parents which a lot of people are dealing with now which is really really tough my father is no longer with us well he was never with you um my mother has dementia now and um which is a horrible disease and so many people are dealing with it right now my mother is lucky in the sense that she doesnt know she has it so shes actually happy shes really happy shes in a really nice place i have her in uh a facility that they have a lot of activities to keep them stimulated theres painting and arts and crafts and bus rides and different things that happen um i dont know whose idea this was but someone booked a magician he he was so excited to be there he was wearing a tuxedo that fit him at one point in his life and hes sitting and hes got a table thirteen women in different stages of dementia and pick a card eh i cant see it what is it its a queen of hearts no dont tell her i want you to look at it and just you just look at that and remember it okay all right put it back in the deck now he goes through the whole thing is this your card no yes it is yes thats your card no you picked that card put it back in oh he got so mad he just he didnt even have to do anything he could have left the room and come back oh a magician you know they would have been like god its always interesting having a conversation with her you never know what youre gonna get and not too long ago she said you didnt go to college did you i said no she goes thats a shame i would have been so proud of you i said well i think i did okay i had that show you liked remember the show yeah i still watch it every day i said no i dont think so um yeah i watch it every day i said no its not on anymore and she goes then who am i watching kelly clarkson judge judy i dont know well yesterdays was very good it was the best one yet okay you know i realize now that my whole life was wrapped up in that show and my mothers whole identity was being ellens mom and now i dont have a show and she doesnt know shes my mom she just thinks im a nice lady that visits her although theres a good chance she thinks im kelly ripa but but shes happy and thats all that matters and im happy too uh yeah im happy not being a boss or a brand or a billboard just a person just a multifaceted person with different feelings and emotions and i can be happy and sad and compassionate or frustrated i have ocd and add im honest im generous im sensitive and thoughtful but im tough and im impatient and im demanding im direct im a strong woman thank you thank you thank you so much im proud of who ive become when youre a public figure youre open to everyones interpretation im sure youve heard the saying what other people think of me is none of my business people will say all kinds of things and you have no control over that but you know the truth and thats all that matters but that is easier said than done because being in this business i have had to care what people think because being a comedian or a host its our only real currency for success if they like you youre in and if they dont youre out and ive spent an entire lifetime trying to make people happy and ive cared far too much what other people think of me so the thought of anyone thinking that im mean was devastating to me and it consumed me for a long time but with time you gain perspective which is one good thing about aging it doesnt totally make up for arthritis and brittle bones but but with perspective you realize that caring what people think to a degree is healthy but not if it affects your mental health so after a lifetime of caring i just cant anymore so i dont but if im being honest and i have a choice of people remembering me as someone who is mean or someone who is beloved beloveed beloved beloved someone who is beloved someone who is beloveed beloved beloveded someone whos beloved someone who is beloveded someone who is beloved i choose that thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you have a seat thank you so much wow wow well wow um first of all first of all that was just um unbelievably beautiful and um you know there is just nothing better than being surrounded by endorphins and joy and we dont get that that often now and this was beautiful tonight this was absolutely i um i had no intention of doing a special i had no intention of doing anything ever again after the show and i really uh i didnt think id ever find the funny in it and the fact that i have been able to travel and do this and see the love and support that is still there for me which i didnt know i had um it is its been its been beyond healing to say the words every night toto feel the support and the love and so i am so glad i got to do this im so glad i got to say goodbye on my terms and i cant thank you enough um this is a night i will always remember and uh i i just i just thank you and i just want to bring my wife out here cause its our anniversary shes crying thank you everybody thank you thank you  im taking my freedom   pulling it off the shelf   putting it on my chain   wearing it around my neck   im taking my freedom   putting it in my car

slowly thats right you a pedophile for my baby you going to jail you sick fuck cause you wanna joebidensniff my baby people say wild shit to me now that i have a kid you know what i mean real maniacal evil shit i had a stranger ive never met before in my life come up to me the other day and tell me having a baby is the best thing thats ever gonna happen to me the best thing and keep in mind i once met forest whitaker in line at an ihop ghost dog i met him at the international house this is how it happened right i was in line minding my business and out of nowhere forest whitaker walked in and he asked to use the bathroom and then the woman behind the register she looked at him she realized holy shit thats forest whitaker and then she said the bathroom was for paying customers only and forest whitaker couldnt believe it he was taken aback he looked at her as if to say maam have you lost your mind im forest goddamn whitaker youve seen my eye but the woman didnt budge a bit she just looked right back at him and rolled her neck as if to say sir you aint special this is an ihop everybodys got a fuckedup eye we all fuckedup in the hop thats how we got here and there was this crazy standoff right between forest whitaker and the pancake lady neither one of them budging a bit and then out of nowhere my boy will he was outside smoking he comes back in he sees forest whitaker he goes oh shit forest whitaker you eat at ihop weird choice and ill never forget it because academyawardwinner forest whitaker he looked at us he looked at everybody in the restaurant and he just went man fuck yall best thing know why best thing is crazy because you and i every single person in this room weve all had so many magical experiences that no human should ever have to weigh themselves against know what i mean its almost unfair to ask you to compare your greatest joys to another its look hey ive gotten pussy and cinnabon in the same night thats a miracle this is a better example okay here it is okay this okay last year for my birthday right me and my friends we did a shitton of mushrooms right we got superhigh on mushrooms real fucked up on mushrooms and then we went to a public park we sat on a bench and then we heckled an adult softball league you understand thats how i celebrated my birthday and ill be honest thats the best thing thats ever happened to me so much funnier than a baby this is why it was dope because those people had paid money to be there the players they had worked hard to organize themselves with registration fees and uniforms all under the guise of spending this peaceful afternoon in the park playing sports with their friends and then out of nowhere a group of urban youth white people cant tell how old we are a group of urban youth some rowdy eighth graders showed up and just started yelling weird mushroomy shit at them stuff that didnt even make sense i was sitting on a bench like hey number three you remember bob dole you know bob dole he was a politician ran for president never won you remember bob dole remember he had that weird fuckedup arm little arm he had to keep a pen in it so nobodyd notice how mangled his little hand was remember bob dole well you throw like bob dole fuck you number three bobdolethrowing motherfucker this was the best part of the afternoon at one point at one point the um the the the left fielder and i guess im cautious to call him a left fielder because he was very clearly an office manager you know what i mean he wasnt left field by trade but the office manager in left field he missed an easy pop fly right easy pop fly goes over his head he falls down super embarrassing moment and then i took it upon myself i stood up in front of everybody at the park i stood up and i shouted hey im not angry but your mother and i are very disappointed i shouted that in front of everybody and what yall have to understand is that that joke did fine here fine yall are cool but at the park i fucking killed you know what i mean yall are okay but at the park i goddamn destroyed me and my friends we were highfiving and shit jogging bitches they stopped they were laughing the mexican man with the popsicles he winked at me gave me a free snoopy destroyed right but heres what you also have to understand is that when i said that i was on mushrooms right i was as high as the day is long so when i said that and me and this person in left field made eye contact there was a brief moment where i was his father you understand i was this white mans dad and ill be honest i was disappointed because this isnt the life that i imagined for my white son maybe thats good enough for your white boys but not mine no sir his mother and i had worked too hard too hard to give him a life he didnt even earn we paid off the dui we bribed the college admissions offices we introduced him to people named humphrey and all we ever asked of him was that he not shame us dont embarrass us in this public way and i got so angry so in my head rageful at what my son was doing that out of nowhere i shouted i shouted in front of everybody hey im selling the house in the berkshires and im cutting you out of the trust and then no one laughed cause no one knew what the fuck i was talking about mexican man took back his popsicle gimme that shit thought you were funny youre weird youre a weird guy at the park best thing youre telling me im the best thing thats ever happened to my parents you youre the best thing thats ever happened to your parents most of us still get embarrassed when we have to read out loud the other day i was reading my daughter a bedtime story and i ran into the word pterodactyl fucked up my whole evening i was just sitting there like what the fuck is a peterodasatill see see see this is the government trying to put the names of prescription drug medications in our childrens books they trying to get my baby hooked on this shit they trying to make my daughter a peterohead cant be

research ive come to discover its not just a me thing in fact every dude in here has the exact same problem ladies whether hes ready to admit it or not every dude has found himself at work just in a marketing meeting with a throbbing erection he cant explain just avoiding pie charts cause those are making it worse somehow like oh god are we at lord im about to bust i cant i pray to god they dont push that pie chart next to another pie chart cause thats titties and imma cum imma cum from that pie booty we cant control our bodies thats why i dont listen to anything men have to say about reproductive responsibility and the women no cause we be hard we be hard and if you got a hard dick you should maybe tuck it in your belt and shut the fuck up im not trying to hear your harddick opinion you cant be erect and correct at the same time thank you hey imma run for president imma be up there giving speeches hard as hell like damn putin got them big bombs dont he shit putin bombs look like titties fuck big ol titty bombs i think i just have fear about what it means to raise a child you know to bring a person to their greatest potential thats scary fear honestly that existed throughout my wifes entire pregnancy terrified genuinely afraid the entire time i was terrified i was gonna end up with a white baby terrified and ill explain it its not as confusing as you think it is im biracial right my mothers black my father is white my wife is the exact same mix so if im halfwhite and shes halfwhite and recessive genes kick in we could end up with a fucking daywalker a little surprise white baby just a little tamponcolored tyler with varicose veins talking bout daddy im in the mood for poached eggs ew i dont want a white baby i dont want a baby that ages like a gypsy curse why does this baby look older than me i hate it hate this white baby and i dont have anything against white people i dont honestly im a big fan of your work i really am rollerblades yall did that dont let anybody tell you you aint make rollerblades yall are the reason we shred like i said man my fathers white so i okay this is the best way this is it okay it here it is its hard to blame the white man for all of your problems when the white man still pays your cell phone bill im on the devils family plan i cant i cant be that you know what i mean i cant be up here like brothers and sisters i said brothers and sisters and maybe even vin diesel its hard to tell with him what color is that exactly periwinkle looking like a oldass cauliflower anyway we must overthrow the white man we must bring every single white person to justice except for the white people who send me money on my birthday also the entire cast of the office they are hilarious and whichever white person invented fruit on the bottom of yogurt i tried it i love it i love it the other day i ate a boysenberry flavor i took a good healthy poop and i thought oh this is why white people act like that too much power i feel too strong i want to open a private prison and use a neti pot i love it take my shoes off on a plane i love it feels good fear know what my biggest fear is with a kid genuinely this is my biggest fear is how do you make your kid into a good person do you know what i mean if you have kids if youre a parent and i think we can all agree on this youre just guessing all of us youre we plug in a formula we plug in the exact same formula you teach em to share you give them motherfuckers vegetables and shit and then you just hope you just hope your kid doesnt into like a serial killer or even worse one of those people who draws lion king characters with human titties you remember those psychopaths in school those future republican senators any cartoon titty kids here tonight anybody want to fess up to what they did nobody ever raises their hand but statistically that cant be correct the math dont check out cause every class i was in id look over and some kid was disgracing the disney corporation and lets be clear ladies and gentlemen thats not what walt disney wanted walt walter disney walt disney wanted good wholesome content also to exterminate the jews he wanted dead jews and good familyfriendly content and now you look over and some kid is drawing zazu just the bird from lion king with big heavy lunch lady titties big casserole and spatula titties now the bird cant fly talking about simba i cant help you become king my back hurts what god would make me like this simba kill me how do you make them good this is a this is a weird transition after that titty joke but i used to be a high school teacher thats what i did before comedy i taught and grade english im the reason your kid pronounces it liberry i coulda helped i chose not to i wanted to see them flail teachings tough man it you this is what made teaching so difficult for me is that no matter how challenging a kid is right no matter how difficult a kid is you have to maintain this hope this faith that they can still grow into better people right that they can still find the best version of themselves and thats so hard because so many kids deserve to be pepper sprayed right they deserve to be maced in their fucking eyeballs until they learn to contribute to society some of the meanest things ever said to me came from children not my enemies little unwashed people motherfuckers who dont wipe so good this is the meanest thing anyones ever said to me i had a little girl raise her hand middle of class she raised her hand to tell me she didnt think i could ever become a professional male model because i have too much adult acne you understand she interrupted class to tell me keep in mind i wasnt trying to be a male model at all i wasnt doing nothing sexy i was trying to teach this bitch to read but something so hateful in her spirit saw me up there trying my best and she thought to herself uhuh uhuh no way uhuh fuck that uhuh this motherfuckers got too much confidence no this bumpyfaced ngga he believes in himself too much i need to let him know that just in case he was thinking about changing careers male model is not an option i know hes trying to make us think critically about literature but fuck that he needs to think about the back of a proactiv bottle his skin is terrible he looks like multigrain imma tell him imma tell him he looks like bread there are kids who i taught that i still want to fight to this day to this day theres this little bitch named edna ill decap ednas knees if i ever see her again this is really what i want some of yall might work in education i think thisll make sense i want to stab edna in the stomach right i wanna knife her up real good in the belly and then afterward i want to stuff the wound with hot cheetos so shed die all spicy and shit fucking hate edna ednas the reason i stopped writing poetry you understand she stole the magic of verse from me let me be clear this wasnt my original dream i didnt want to perform behind a bar you know what i mean i wanted to be a poet i was oh man im telling you i was going to be a poet i yall i i was gonna write silky metaphors i was gonna wear a thick tweed jacket i was going to go down on weird ladies with hairy armpits i was going to be a poet and then i had to teach an afterschool poetry program for ednas class and every day for eight consecutive weeks that little girl hurt my feelings she made me sad for two lunar cycles and now i want her dead this was a poetry class and this is where i messed up this was my mistake im going to admit that up top this is where i messed up i thought the best way to get these kids to write their poems was for me to share one of my own right huge mis right yeah i get it i fucked up i should have just read them tupac lyrics like my teachers did for me listen up kids first off fuck yo bitch and the clique you claim thats called a stanza even worse the poem that i read them was a poem that meant a lot to me at the time it was a poem about a friend of mine who died in a car crash this girl i know who died in a car crash and in the poem i do all this metaphorical work to compare her death to the death of a spider i found in my windowsill and the final lines of the poem go the exact final lines of the poem go how close to god this spider must feel weaving a world above the earth the string as thin as breath the breath so easily silenced a net of wings fluttering toward blind quiet before i could even finish before anyone even had a chance to process the words coming out of my mouth edna just went damn this poetry nggas gay as hell fucking bitch i oughta kill this stupid little bitch ill punch you in the head stupid bitch punch you dead in your fucking face kids break you they break the person you thought you were going to be and then we subsequently break them and it becomes this ugly cycle of broken people this is a great example of what i mean years ago i read this article about a teacher in idaho right teacher in idaho who got fired from his job he got arrested he got taken to jail because he brought a puppy to school to show his class right seems harmless enough he brought a puppy to the school he showed the puppy to his students and then afterwards he fed that puppy to the classs pet snapping turtle everybody okay i didnt do it im just a reporter you understand he fed a baby dog to a living dinosaur in front of children and every article i read had the same reaction many of you are having every single one was like oh my god what kind of irreparable damage has this man done to these kids what kind of permanent damage has he done to these poor kids and i kept reading those articles and thinking about my experience as a teacher and i kept thinking man fuck those kids fuck them what kind of permanent damage did those kids do to him cause he wasnt like that at the beginning of the year he didnt start off that way that wasnt written in the syllabus they broke him they broke his brain they taunted him and they teased him and they took pictures of his paycheck and they posted it on the internet till one day he snapped and he found himself holding a dog over this ravenous reptile staring out at like is this what you want are you not entertained i swear to god if one more of yall brings up my divorce ill kill this fucking dog todays lesson is about minding your goddamn business turn to page okay this next selection from sunset singles this next piece i want to share with you is a personal favorite its a personal favorite its a little number that ive simply entitled sophisticated sophisticated well play it for you now hello this is joe calling you have a very sophisticated voice as well as a very sophisticated oh you must be a very sophisticated person id love to meet up with you if youd like to have a drink im a lawyer give me a call if you would at area code okay first of all first of all can anyone hear definitively prove that that wasnt joe biden can you definitively prove that that wasnt americas horniest president whos trying to stutter his way into a little side malarkey you know little malarkey on the side and for those of you pulling back because i do see some of you youre getting out yeah youre wondering maybe this is too far let me remind you im trying to have sex with him hes not a victim in this situation hes a man who im trying to give some pussy im a hero in this story how do you make a good person people say love love you know the thing that flavor flav and brigitte nielsen have they say thats how you make a good person i dont know if i believe in that i dont know if i still believe in love honestly i just found out that my wife thinks that im special needs and yes she means it in a derogatory way shes a bad lady she should go to jail lock her up the other day she called me from work and she said this to me verbatim verbatim this is what she said to me now keep in mind i have changed some of the words to make me sound better and her sound worse but verbatim this is what she said to me she called me up and she said hey im making chili tonight and i need you to heat up a can of beans then she said and ill never forget it and whatever you do dont put the can in the microwave you understand she told me her emergency contact not to put a can and when she said that i took a deep breath you know i took a deep breath and i really thought about all the time weve spent together the love that weve shared the bond that weve built i took a deep breath and then finally very calmly i said i said i said bitch ill fucking kill you i will kill you dead i will take that gun that we bought after white people tried to take back the country from other white people and i will shoot you in the leg is that what you think of me that im metalinamicrowave stupid you let me cum inside of you you let that cum become a person you leave me alone for hours completely unsupervised with that cum not to mention all those loose cans of beans and this whole time she just been thinking damn i bet some day he gon kill himself with a microwave i bet some day he gon put a can of spaghettios in the microwave push the popcorn button and blow his fucking face off and then our daughters gonna have to grow up in a world where people refer to her dumbass daddy as orville deadenbacher its a long way for a pun some say too long thats critique ive heard too long love you want to talk about love my mom my mom has been married four times to four different men four thats a jodecis worth of husbands some of yall are white thats a degrees worth of husbands for the older people jersey boys four different husbands and sometimes i think my moms the only person whos truly figured love out you know what i mean shes the only person who figured out what love is supposed to be because while the rest of us have potentially wasted our lives trying to find some perfect special someone who may not even exist instead my mom gets married every el ni\\u00f1o she finds a new husband every other toyotathon and she just be having fun out there shell marry anybody oldass karate students grown men who order apple juice at restaurants at one point im not making this up my mom married a disgraced nba mascot yeah thats not a mad lib thats a choice she made in front of god and the government and all right lets just start from the beginning ill walk you you have questions i have answers first of all did you know that nba mascots could be disgraced no even worse did you know these disgraced motherfuckers could fuck your mom apparently it could happen to any of us apparently none of our mothers can resist the sexual chemistry of a dishonorably discharged benny the bull my mom married benny the bull and not at his best no dont clap for that shame on you its hurting my family and the next question youre naturally asking you want to know how did he lose his job as benny the bull right how does one lose such a coveted position as chicago mascot benny the bull ill tell you he was fired from his job as benny the bull because and im not making this up in he got caught selling drugs after a game in full costume just standing in the parking lot even the police walked up like benny what are you doing those are your work clothes he was arrested he was banned from the stadium for life and my personal favorite detail they added his name to the wikipedia page when you go home tonight look it up yourself go to wikipediaorgbennythebull and then when youre there scroll down to a section entitled scandals and there you will read about possibly the dumbest man for whom ive ever had to buy a fathers day card love what is it even mean to be a good person you know what i mean given the state of the world what does good person even really mean all of our heroes are monsters and all of our monsters have podcasts what does good person even mean i dont there is no good and bad its not just good and bad its not just right and wrong its not just darkskinned sammy sosa and hellokittycolored sammy sosa there are so many different shades of sammy sosa inbetween my personal favorite tapioca sosa good and bad thats all bullshit this is a great example this is a perfect metaphor of what im trying to say my favorite restaurant in the world my absolute favorite restaurant in the world is mcdonalds how dare you watch your goddamn mouth i love mcdonalds i dont care what anybody says i love it its i love everything about it i like the food i like the service when people show me fight videos at mcdonalds i root for the staff yall dont know how to act in a classy establishment the manager has on a visor show some respect i love mcdonalds the other day im at mcdonalds and i order myself a nugget thats my shit now heres where the story gets crazy because the woman behind the register she winked at me she winked at me and then she gave me nuggets whoo come on some of yall get it some of yall know exactly what happened for those of you that dont dont worry ill explain eleven nuggets is a mistake right thats a miscal she aint go to college thats a miscalculation thats a miscalculation of the nugget eleven nuggets is a mistake but nuggets shes trying to fuck right shes trying to have sex with me for nugget the box doesnt even close all the way with nuggets its just sitting wide open ready for me to come inside put some sauce on it you know what sauce im talking about it aint barbecue it aint barbecue and my wife doesnt even like when i go to mcdonalds she gets so upset oh my god mcdonalds that stuff is terrible for you they make their nuggets out of failed pregnancy tests she says wild shit evil shit about mcdonalds and yet here i was standing in front of a woman willing to give me more nuggets than ive ever experienced in my life just a utopia of nuggets in a bag and i swear to god in that moment in that exact moment it took everything in my being not to run away with the mcdonalds lady yeah not to just run away and start a new life bro wed have a beautiful life the mcdonalds lady isnt going to make me read the mcdonalds lady isnt going to make me fold fitted sheets or vote during midterm elections the mcdonalds lady is just going to give me nuggets shell give me nuggets then shell give me nasty mcdonalds sex gimme just that raw its just sex and nuggets and sex and nuggets and sex and nuggets till we both die at happy just keel over and die from nugget poisoning dead and maybe hear me out yall maybe maybe thats what we all should want maybe thats the dream no youre right maybe thats the dream we should all be chasing lets be honest the world is ending it is thats not political slant you dont gotta agree with it it is ice caps are melting bumblebees are dying they added black people to jackass were done this grown black man being like kick me in the dick johnny knoxville ill try it were done but heres a ray of sunshine i offer you before we go home this evening heres a little silver lining the other day i read an article about a woman who kept a box of chicken mcnuggets for six years six years she kept the box shes single six years she aint seeing nobody she got all them nuggets everywhere she kept this box of chicken mcnuggets and on the day of that sixth year the day that six years hit she opened that box she looked inside youve already guessed it those nuggets were exactly as she left them no change whatsoever no mold no crust them little things that be growing on morgan freemans face those old little ngga chocolate chips he got popping up everywhere nothing and i read that article and i thought to myself holy shit most marriages dont make it six years right most of our promises before god end well before these nuggets ever did maybe all of this is a fallacy maybe all these suggestions of eternity and everlasting are bullshit maybe we should just be eating what we want and microwaving cans and jerking off to the green mm do you know what i mean just beating our meat to the green one cause she got eyelashes and we like that i dont care if you take her boots away shes still got them eyelashes let me see them eyelashes you know what i like maybe the only forever we can guarantee is chicken mcnuggets then i thought to myself holy shit i shoulda got my dick sucked by that mcdonalds lady because maybe the preservatives in her mouth wouldve transferred onto my penis and made my nuggets last forever and that above everything else would be the best thing thats ever happened to me and if you didnt like that joke just know that getting my dick sucked is a metaphor for finding true happiness beyond the broken expectations of a dying world if you did like that joke fuck yeah this final selection from sunset singles this final piece i wanna share with you this evening is untitled theres no title for this one but i will say it is by far the most haunting message that i have ever heard or received in my time on this planet earth truly bonechilling shit thats all you need to know well play it for you now oh youre our its good to be here and im just here searching for that special one if i dont write you i dont like you if i write you then i like you lets watch it grow slowly slow but steady hit me up if you think you like me lets get familiar so now yall gotta go home with

months ago ive been doing standup comedy for years yeah thank you thank you thank you my agent said to me anthony years is a major accomplishment for any comedian you gotta celebrate pick some of your favorite cities go perform for them and i said no thank you id rather go to milwaukee but look i am excited to be here tonight ive got great news after years of standup comedy just last weekend i finally perfected my act dont get me wrong i thought it was perfect before ran into an audience member after my show last saturday who told me different last saturday night im doing a show in new york after my set im trying to get out to the car a woman from the audience chases me down practically tackles me she says anthony that last joke you told tonight your closer ive gotta tell you that joke is problematic you need to think about it and you need to change it so i changed it and now its my opener so what im gonna do is im gonna tell you that joke explain what happened with that woman and then nail home the point that im the best now as a comedian ive got a responsibility a responsibility that i take very seriously the responsibility to get up in front of a group of strangers and give you my opinion on the trans community yeah thats right look guys youve got to do it now its in the handbook now i feel i feel like the trans community are the new pregnant women just in that it is never polite to guess guys youve got to trust me on this you never you never want to be like hey how far along are you are you going to keep it or no no dont do that even if youre right its rude do what i do im smooth with it i dont ask the question if i want to find something out i just offer you a drink here have this glass of bourbon and if they say actually anthony im seven months pregnant then i get to be like oh my god you look amazing but if they take the drink theyre trans now obviously obviously thats a closer i could leave right now itd be fine but this woman grabs me starts arguing with me she says anthony ive gotta ask you what is your intention with that trans joke i said well my intention is to make trans people laugh i mean could you imagine that would be historic and she says well anthony anthony youre probably not even aware of this but the problem with your joke is some trans people are insecure about the fact that they cant have kids of their own and your joke makes it sound like youre saying the opposite of a pregnant woman is a trans woman and that could be hurtful and i agree that could be hurtful but not coming from me you see i love trans people i empathize with the trans community im not trans myself but i too am always getting yelled at for walking into the wrong bathroom i love trans people you know what i hate pregnant women i mean fuck those chubby bitches am i right they shouldnt be allowed to play sports now look look i will admit i will admit that was a learning moment for me before that woman grabbed me i didnt know that trans people hated pregnant women as much as i do makes me respect them all the more so just in case anyone here tonight is trans and you were offended by my first joke heres a joke i tailor wrote just for you to enjoy last week i saw a pregnant woman get hit by a bus or as i like to call it a gender reveal party what are you guys laughin at thats not for you thats just for my trans friends dont like pregnant women dont like kids one of my friends just asked me if i would be the sperm donor for her baby i said i dont know thats a pretty big decision how old is your baby if youre walkin in late i hate kids i hate them so much its my whole thing and what surprises me is now that im getting older ive got friends family members having kids of their own and i dont judge throw your life away what surprises me is these people will text me pictures of their kids anthony will want to see this send i never want to see that the only time a kid shows up on my phone and im happy about it amber alert otherwise otherwise do not get my hopes up i used to ignore those texts from my friends pretend i didnt see em never respond then my sister had a kid started getting mad at me shed be like really anthony no response you got nothing to say about this picture of your beautiful niece fucking up finger painting so i came up with a plan now anytime anytime anyone texts me a picture of their kids i write back the exact same response thanks gonna save this one for later yup no that works you guys can use that it works i havent heard from my sister in a year its the best mmhmm like a lot of people i spent most of the pandemic stuck inside starin at the walls goin crazy i started buyin weird shit online decided i was gonna redecorate my place i dont know anything about interior design but i know what i like so i went on ebay and i paid for a childs coffin i thought thisll be great its vintage you put that in your living room its a conversation starter you know but like so many of the things we bought online during the pandemic i regret it now thing finally showed up in the mail empty i know i know look guys guys guys i hate kids so goddamn much i cant talk to kids these days the other day my little nephew came up to me he said uncle anthony ive been getting bullied by another kid in school i said dont put up with that break his nose hell leave you alone he said uncle anthony thats toxic masculinity well i wasnt gonna put up with that listen you guys came out here to have a good time on a saturday night i know what you want you want to talk politics lets go let me tell you whats wrong with this country let me tell you what the problem is with the united states of america in this country youve gotta be years old to drive a car right that makes sense but youve gotta be years old to be considered an adult to vote i think thats fucked up i think if youre old enough and mature enough to safely drive a car on the street then i should be allowed to have sex with you right anyway thats the only problem with this country now as of this weekend ive been on tour with this material for months and my favorite thing about touring around the country with these jokes the past months has been telling that last joke in the south guys i have learned so much about this great country of ours right at the beginning of this tour months ago i was doing a show in alabama told them that joke guy in the audience stands up and says anthony i hate to break it to you but the age of consent in alabama is so you gotta change that i said oh yeah you got to change that and then a couple of weeks later i did a show in mississippi told them that joke then told them about alabama guy in the audience stands up and says in mississippi the age of consent is and i said holy shit thats perfect i mean that is what the founding fathers were all about you know i have a friend who works for the fbi he pretends to be a girl goes on the internet and chats with child molesters all day i dont know what he does for the fbi but its gotta be i feel like the big new thing i keep hearing more and more about these days is porn addiction i feel like every time i turn around someone is complaining about their porn addiction not me i can handle my shit but a couple of months ago im at a family reunion big jeselnik family reunion everyone is there and the very first night were all in this giant ballroom eating dinner together as a family when my cousin stands up hes years old he says i have an announcement to make i just want to tell you all that ive been suffering from a porn addiction and its terrible but im doing my best to get over it no one in my family knows what to say generations of jeselniks are just staring straight ahead trying to eat their dinner so i stood up i said hey man we can watch something else look i can put the game on if you want but whens the next time were all gonna be together you know i dont have a porn addiction i watch a healthy amount of porn ive got my favorites hell i was in a bar the other night saw my favorite porn star of all time sitting at the end of the bar by herself i couldnt believe it i called the bartender over man ill have another beer and see that girl down there she shouldnt be here shes now this is where audiences traditionally start to complain theyll say anthony why do you have so many jokes about abusing children and why do you do them all in the beginning and this is where i kind of have to stop the show for a minute and i explain to the audience the concept of gallows humor gallows humor is what im all about gallows humor is when you see something in the world that is so horrible that you have to laugh at it otherwise it would destroy you a couple of months ago im reading the newspaper and i come across an article about a priest in my hometown who just got arrested for molesting an altar boy at the exact same church where i was an altar boy growing up that was horrifying to read that couldve been me if i had become a priest we like to have fun im proud to say that ive never once in my entire life paid money to have sex with a prostitute and ill tell you this they get so mad you know theres one thing i like about milwaukee and there is one thing i like about milwaukee seems like a safe place to live yeah maybe not to you but compared to where i live in los angeles oh my god this is paradise my neighborhoods really gone to shit in the past couple years gotten dangerous the other day a woman in my neighborhood was walking her dog had the dog stolen from her at gunpoint now its my dog i actually do love it here in milwaukee i enjoy any time i get to come and perform one of the alltime great standup comedy towns milwaukee yeah it cheers me up to be back in milwaukee ill tell you that ive needed cheering up lately too ive been a little down lately ill admit it lost a friend recently stupid friend of mine went to the hospital for an elective surgery a simple breast reduction surgery did not survive the surgery died right there on the operating table as far as im concerned yeah somehow thats become one of the most polarizing jokes im gonna tell all night and if you didnt laugh at it thats okay but what the fuck do you know ive been doing this for years and ill be honest i had no idea it had been years before my agent told me i never thought of years as a goal i should be trying to achieve ive never defined success by longevity ive always defined success by how long has it been since i had to have a roommate yeah its true i havent had a roommate in years im thats not a flex last roommate i ever had last roommate i ever had he had a video of every single person hed ever had sex with in our apartment yeah its a betrayal of trust but it was hilarious he had no idea another way i define success as an artist how long has it been since i had to have a day job again years i hated the day jobs i had to have coming up imagine what i was like at a day job years ago i had this one day job someone kept stealing my lunch someone stole my lunch every single day even though i clearly had my name written on it and i was pretty sure i knew who did it i just couldnt prove it so one day before work i crushed up an entire bottle of laxatives enough laxatives to cripple a man and i put them in my food and then i waited until this guy got up to go to the bathroom and as soon as he did i shit all over his desk yeah i got fired from most of my day jobs all of them really all of them except the last one last day job i ever had i worked in a giant soulless corporate office building and i quit in the middle of the day after i watched a woman accidentally step into an empty elevator shaft and plummet stories to her death i just walked right the fuck out and that was my last day in elevator repair if theres one thing im getting sick of after years of standup comedy its the travel i always say i do the shows for free you pay me to travel and that is certainly true tonight two nights ago i fly from new york city to milwaukee twoandahalfhour flight its direct it should be easy i get on the plane the woman sitting next to me has a dog curled up in her lap and i say excuse me but what the fuck is this this woman i swear to god she rolls her eyes at me and she goes uh this is my emotional support animal i have a note from my doctor i was like note from your doctor do you really need an emotional support animal on this flight and she goes no and i thought my head was going to explode i dont like when people take advantage of the system like that its a twoandahalfhour flight i talked to her about it im happy to report by the time we landed she needed that fucking dog air travel has gotten so uncomfortable in the past few years but everyone i know who flies a lot like i do they always have a little trick everyones got their own unique trick to make flying easier for them like im friends with a very wealthy married couple theyre millionaires and they got six kids in between the two of em theyre always flying off on some exotic family vacation and whenever they fly their trick is the family flies on two separate airplanes that way worstcase scenario one of those planes crashes they dont have to deal with their kids anymore uhhuh but look if im being honest with you guys if im being honest i dont actually have any married friends i used to used to have a lot of married friends but all my married friends have gotten divorced in the past two years all of them but ive noticed something all my friends divorces they all had two things in common infidelity and me hey listen all right listen you guys have been great so far i hate to do this to you but this next joke is gonna be too smart for the crowd dont worry i will explain it to you and after all arent those the best jokes sigmund freuds mom mustve been so fucking hot okay get that a lot of you were faking it for the cameras let me explain dr sigmund freud the most famous psychoanalyst of all time his main theory his main claim to fame was the theory that every young man wanted to murder his own father and have sex with his own mother imagine imagine how hot his mom must have been for his colleagues to go publish that i was years old when i walked in on my parents having sex thats a big moment for any young man that moment when you realize your parents are more than just mom and dad theyre also swingers yeah that was a core memory for sure never forget that ill never forget the night of my senior prom night of my senior prom im years old im at home putting on my tuxedo when my dad walked in the room and he handed me a condom snuck it to me in a handshake so fuckin gross then he looks me right in the eyes and he says anthony do you have any questions i said yeah dad do you have one thats still in the wrapper yeah my dad was fuckin weird okay all your dads are weird when youre a kid you cant recognize how weird your parents are its not until you get older that you figure it out like when i was a little kid every year on my birthday my dad would take me into the kitchen put me up against the kitchen wall and make a little mark to measure my girth mm and maybe that messed me up a little bit i dont know i feel like im a pretty normal guy although i do get angry when people try to talk to me about sex i was having lunch with a friend the other day and he says anthony ive been havin trouble with premature ejaculation i said oh yeah why dont you try talkin about baseball he said anthony dont you mean thinking about baseball and i said i dont give a fuck what you think about just dont talk to me about your premature ejaculation when i was growin up i had a sibling rivalry with my little brother got out of hand to be quite honest one day my little brother went into the backyard took my dogs collar off and let it run away from home so i poisoned his fish i think i won that one cause the next day i went out and i found my dog put his collar back on brought him back home but my brother he died from the salmon yeah its a banger last year my parents lost all of their money in a ponzi scheme so of course they came to me their wealthy successful son and asked me why i did that mm mm yeah my family didnt have a lot of money when i was growin up my dad was a volunteer firefighter do you know what a volunteer firefighter is it is exactly like a regular firefighter except your son does not respect you my moms been having a hard time shes gettin paranoid in her old age cant sleep at night cause she gets too scared so every night around bedtime she calls me to complain on the phone for hours that shes too afraid to fall asleep in her own home so finally after months of this just to get her off my back i bought her a gun and now shes scared about that she said anthony whats the matter with you dont you know that people who live with a gun are more than twice as likely to be shot in their own home i said mom i am counting on it and look maybe maybe im being too harsh i have trouble sleeping sometimes too like the other night the other night im lying in bed and i cannot fall asleep im just staring out my bedroom window for hours and i swear i saw my nextdoor neighbor murder his wife in their kitchen then dispose of the body in garbage bags now im worried im next like i dont think he saw me but he sure as shit heard me clappin now heres a joke i like a lot my cousin randy is maybe the dumbest person ive ever met in my entire life dumbest guy ive ever met the other day he comes up and he goes anthony check out my new tattoo its the japanese symbol for awesome no randy thats a swastika i mean fuck man everybody knows everybody knows thats the german symbol for awesome now i said i liked that joke a lot heres how much i like that joke i used to open with it right at the beginning of this tour months ago kanye west came to one of my shows i had no idea he was even there i didnt find out until the next day when kanye went on a podcast and he said i went to go see anthony jeselnik last night and his opening joke is so high level that it made me realize im not funny guys that blew my mind thats the best compliment ive ever gotten in my life i humbled kanye west you know yeah im not gonna lie i was so excited i watched that clip times i sent it to my manager i said put this on my website put it on social media lets sell some fucking tickets with a little help from kanye and my manager says to me anthony are you out of your goddamn mind dont you know whats been going on with kanye lately and i said no honestly i used to be a huge kanye fan but i stopped paying attention to him when he went christian and my manager says well in the past two weeks alone kanyes been wearing white lives matter tshirts and saying wild antisemitic shit and i was like oh he went super christian that crazy son of a bitch finally finished the whole book my manager said look anthony you can use this clip of kanye to promote yourself if you want to but if you do you gotta drop that swastika joke you gotta stop doing it for sure otherwise youre gonna start to attract the wrong kinds of fans and your current fans will take the wrong lesson from what youre doing and thats how much i like that joke im against cancel culture thank you thats my impression of a shit comic trying to get on rogan in years of standup comedy ive been asked the same questions over and over and over again the question i get asked the most by far is anthony what do you think about cancel culture does it make you mad arent you scared what do you think about cancel culture so let me be clear i dont give a fuck about cancel culture what i am sick of are comedians complaining about cancel culture its not that hard do your job comedians are supposed to be unparalleled badasses i know this because i have a fucking mirror cancel culture is not scary its also not interesting and its definitely not new back when i was in college i had this crazy professor made all of his students fill out their own suicide note then he would read them out loud to the rest of the class as soon as the parents found out he got fired immediately and i was the only one who stood up for him because hey he made math fun and yes i did mention joe rogan guys do not get me wrong i like joe joes my friend joes a good guy but if you listen to his podcast youre a fucking loser my brotherinlaw is joe rogans biggest fan never misses an episode doesnt think four hours is long enough but my brotherinlaw is joe rogans target demographic my brotherinlaw is a conspiracy theorist a crazy conspiracy theorist like my brotherinlaw refuses to become an organ donor because he swears that if you get into an accident and the paramedics see that youre an organ donor they wont try to save your life cause they want to use your organs to help someone else its insane but i cant argue with him hes a paramedic another question ive been asked a million times in the last years anthony whats your favorite joke youve ever written its easy the first one twenty years ago when i started this i started from nothing i was nothing i was just going around to open mics in los angeles performing for bitter openmic comedians who never reacted to anything i was just trying to find my voice could i be good at this could i make it a living and it took a while until one night i went to a coffee shop tried this joke out for the first time changed my whole life i said guys my girlfriend loves to eat chocolate shes always eating chocolate and she likes to joke shes got a chocolate addiction hmm keep me away from those chocolate bars im addicted to em and its really annoying so one day i put her in the car and i drove her downtown and i pointed out a crack addict and i said do you see that honey why cant you be that skinny and i will never forget telling that joke for the very first time to a room full of bitter openmic comedians who never reacted to anything and the whole room just went ooh i was like oh im gonna be a fucking star and then of course a couple years later i got my big break and i got to do some roasting got to roast donald trump charlie sheen roseanne barr all the greats people still ask me anthony which one was your favorite charlie sheen but not because of charlie sheen i didnt give a fuck about charlie sheen i remember a couple days before that roast im at home writing jokes and i get a phone call from the network and they say anthony i know you only have a couple days left to write but we just added mike tyson to the dais will you be able to write yourself any jokes about mike tyson two days later i am walking into that roast with jokes about mike tyson i am so excited and right as i go to sit down guy from the network comes back he goes im just doublechecking with you you dont have any mike tyson rape jokes do you and i said why and he said well it was almost impossible to get mike tyson to agree to appear on a televised roast we had to promise him there would be no rape jokes i was like are we talking about the same mike tyson so now the roast has begun im up at the podium cameras are rolling i have zero jokes about mike tyson and i am mad about it but out of the corner of my eye i can see mike tyson sitting on the stage mikes been drinkin mikes been smokin mikes laughing at everything mikes responding to jokes that arent even about him mike tyson was having the time of his life so i think you know what i can do one so i said i think mike tysons biggest problem is mike never had a strong male role model growing up mikes dad walked out on the family very early on after mike raped him now as soon as i tell this joke as soon as i tell this joke i regret it i am afraid and i turned to look at mike tyson to see is he coming at me am i about to die and i just see mike tyson throw his head back and he goes he got you charlie guys in years of standup comedy ive gotten to meet so many famous people havent given a fuck about any of em except for one and that was norm macdonald yeah yeah all right long before i ever even considered becoming a comedian i worshiped norm macdonald he was my hero when i was a kid hes still my hero today never got to meet him for the longest time then a couple years ago i get a phone call from my agent he says anthony how would you like to be the new host of last comic standing and i said why the fuck would i want to do that that show sucks and he said this year its gonna be different this year they have norm macdonald as a judge would you like to work with norm and i signed up on the spot norm and i made eight episodes of this tv show together eight straight nights of eighthour tapings every night and for the first four episodes norm macdonald and i do not get along at all we get into fights every night on the air we get into fights every night backstage we flatout do not like each other and its killing me hes my hero and the only reason i took this job so for those first four episodes i am working at it and im working at it hard norms working at it too just not nearly as hard but after four episodes for whatever reason something clicks finally norm and i are laughing together were getting along all i ever wanted after the show was finally finished norm and i had to go and promote it and the last time i ever saw norm macdonald we are backstage at larry king im getting interviewed first and then norm right before i go out norm says to me hey anthony i know we havent always gotten along or seen eyetoeye but if youre up for it and you trust me i thought of something really funny that you and i could do together i said oh my god norm of course youre my hero tell me what you want to do he says i think itll be funny if instead of promoting the show by talking about these other comedians why dont you and i just promote the show by publicly insulting each other he says dont even try to be funny anthony just be mean and i said you know what norm i can do that i sit down with larry king larry says anthony what you think about norm macdonald and i said larry norm macdonald is a piece of shit and i can hear norm laughing backstage i finish the interview i go backstage norm is still laughin he says anthony that was perfect now watch this norm sits down with larry king larry king says norm what do you think about anthony jeselnik norm says larry hes one of the greats ive never been more pissed off in my entire life cant believe i fell for that you have been an amazing crowd today im going to leave you all with this this is my new closer dont worry it is transproof about a month ago i went to a wedding craziest wedding ive ever seen after the ceremony every single person there took molly the bride took molly the groom took molly the parents the grandparents every single person there was on molly craziest shit ive ever seen i blacked out around midnight woke up the next morning in a fucking hammock somewhere went and found the bride and groom and i was like hey guys did i do anything embarrassing last night and they said yeah anthony you spiked the punch with molly thank you very much milwaukee have a great night thank you\",\n          \"ellen degeneres for your approval is less a comedy special and more an hourlong ego massage for the embattled host what should have been a triumphant farewell instead feels like a poorly executed pr stunt filled with tired drawnout jokes and forced selfdeprecation ellen spends much of the special rehashing controversies surrounding her toxic workplace allegations but instead of addressing them meaningfully she spins these moments into awkward jokes coming across as defensive rather than introspective the comedy itself is uninspired and stale with tired observations about things like car troubles pigeons and aging that feel recycled from better comics the pacing is atrocious dragging on for what feels like an eternity with ellen stretching out weak material well beyond its comedic lifespan her attempts to balance humor with personal reflection fall flat making it seem more like shes fishing for sympathy rather than offering genuine entertainment whats most striking is the clear disconnect between ellen and her audience the packed crowd of adoring fans seems willing to laugh at anything she says but the comedy is hollow with ellen relying on her celebrity status rather than delivering anything truly funny or meaningful its painfully obvious that this special exists not because she has anything new to say but because she needs to reclaim some positive attention after her tarnished reputation for your approval is a disappointing selfserving finale that highlights how out of touch ellen has become for anyone hoping for a strong farewell from a comedy icon this special is a huge letdown if this is ellens swan song its a sour note to go out on if you have never seen ellen do standup live you are in for a treat tonight two minutes her first appearance on network television would you welcome ellen degeneres wouldnt it be great if we could pick up the phone and call up god and ask yeah hi god this is ellen ellen degeneres degeneres wwhats so funny i never thought of that it does sound like that doesnt it my grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was shes today we dont know where the hell she is ellen is on the fast track shes one of the top female comedians on television ellens new sitcom is a certifiable topten hit the real ellen is putting all that success and fame at risk susan im gay more than million people watched her comingout episode why did you think it was necessary for you to come out because its okay ellen finds herself at the center of a storm of controversy being accused of going too far too gay when life gets you down you know what you gotta do  just keep swimming swimming swimming  she may have pulled off one of the greatest comebacks of all time the ellen show has become one of the most popular shows in the world praised for delivering a daily dose of joy with its unique mix of dancing games talk and millions of dollars in audience giveaways spreading laughter seems to be working well for the entertainer and comedian and shes showing no signs of slowing down a few years ago i started ending my show by saying be kind to one another heres the downside um i can never do anything unkind ever now ever breaking news tonight is the queen of nice  really the queen of mean respond to this with the most insane stories about ellen being mean shes not the happygolucky nice person ellen degeneres is under fire again with accusations of a toxic work environment toxic phony hypocrite liar things are spiraling ellen degeneres degeneres degeneres its a breaking story in the world of entertainment and this is great great news ellen is back although shes saying this new special will be her farewell thank you thank you thank you thank you so much it seems like you still care you know i used to say that i didnt care what other people thought of me i realize now looking back i said that at the height of my popularity if i look older than when you saw me last its because im older than when you saw me last and also i stopped doing botox and filler yeah i used to do botox back when i didnt care what other people thought of me thats when i did it such a waste of time to worry about what people think of us just a waste of energy were just guessing we dont know its impossible to know what people are thinking i walk out here tonight and im hoping that youre thinking this is marvelous im so happy to be here that is my hope but well good but some of you could be thinking lets see how this goes some of you may be thinking why is she doing this does she owe back taxes im here because i love doing standup i miss doing standup and i like making people happy and i do care what people think we all care what people think we can say we dont we can pretend we dont care all it takes is trying to parallel park in front of a crowded outdoor caf\\u00e9 spot looks big enough you line it up the way you always do you pull in cut it a little too close youre scraping the hubcap the entire way along the curb making a very loud noise put it in drive pull out try it again now youve overcompensated youre sticking so far out youre blocking traffic in that lane now you have a decision to make do you have the confidence to pull out and do it right this time or do you do that backandforth backandforth backandforth inching your way to the curb knowing how long thats gonna take and people are watching the deep shame you feel when you give up and drive away even if youre meeting someone you say im so sorry i couldnt make it and theyre like you did i was sitting there i was watching you i started the chant its funny how we can be embarrassed all by ourselves in a car all by ourselves for anything just any stupid reason like even if we just cant figure out how to turn our windshield wipers off which to me is one of the most embarrassing things is driving a car when its not raining and the windshield wipers are going and its because someone decided to add a random one we had the windshield wiper situation was fine we had the fast mode for when its raining heavily medium light and then someone decided were just gonna wash away the rain once in a while we dont need to see all the time and its always a surprise cause you think the rain has stopped youve turned it off and youre driving along and five minutes later you see this thing like then youre trying to fiddle with it trying to turn it off and you dont know how cause its always different sometimes its on the end of the lever on the steering wheel sometimes theres a lever within the lever the baby lever like the lever had a baby and its inside the lever right there tiny baby lever you dont trust it cause youre just waiting even if its not going youre like its gonna go again i know it i feel it and then finally it does and then you feel pretty confident about it then you catch the rearview mirror your back ones been on the whole time yeah thats what you did you turned that one on you turn that off turn everything back on again you have to sell your car theres so many extraneous things in a car we dont need for instance i have never used my parking brake ive never parked my car and thought i want it more parked than this there are things you need the seat adjustments scoot forward lean back you need those then theres that one button that inflates the back of the seat the one that makes you feel like youre getting spooned by a pregnant woman oh boy ooh all right apparently its for lumbar support got to support your lumbar you got to its all any of us knows about the lumbar its got to be supported you dont get support for your lumbar any place other than your car you dont even hear about the lumbar anyplace else bill whats wrong whats happening its my damn lumbar i havent been driving enough lately mm thats how you walk when your lumbar is out there are buttons in my car ive never used never will use theres a button with squiggly lines next to a misshapen peanut i dont know ive never touched it im fine theres a button with tally marks next to a sideways yarmulke what the hell dont get me started on the dashboard lights too the dashboard lights are not illuminated all the time so when they are it must mean something serious right but check engine thats vague ive checked it its there i shouldnt have to guess from an exclamation point between two parentheses that my tire pressure is low but if my windshield wiper fluid is low all the words windshield wiper fluid low oh my god pull over just cause i dont know my buttons doesnt mean im stupid just means im not interested were all interested in different things all good at different things i was talking to someone and they said i dont know how you get on stage i could never do that i said well i dont know how you dryclean clothes clean clothes dryly and then you martinize on top of that some of you are in your twenties you dont know what martinizing is no its not my job to explain it to you also i dont know and i never have yeah none of us do let me catch you up on whats been going on with me since you saw me last i got chickens yeah thank you i love them so very much chickens are the best bird to have at home i think so a lot of people think parrots but theyre so gossipy you have to be really careful what you say around them chickens will never talk they have little personalities ive always wanted chickens now i have them theyre so cute they see me they recognize me when i walk towards them and they run to me i put a swing in there for them and they get on a swing chicken on a swing thats ridiculous i have a bench in there and i go sit there and they sit on my lap and i pet them and they fall asleep and they give me an egg every day they lay an egg every day as someone who hosted a daily talk show i can really appreciate that yeah yeah im sure theyre thinking i just laid an egg i dont think i can do that again tomorrow and yet they do theyre curious little animals too theyre very curious hey you know how people always ask why did the chicken cross the road i think i know now that i have chickens its their innate sense of adventure im sorry to be just another comedian going on and on about her chickens another thing about chickens is that um they they fly people think theyre flightless birds and that is not true they do fly the longest recorded chicken flight is seconds isnt that amazing someone thought to time that yeah also chickens dream scientists have discovered that chickens dream now listen i love animals more than anyone but we could take scientists working on chicken dreams and move them on over to climate change im not saying that chicken dreaming is not worth studying it is but we dont need our top minds on it i dont think i am curious what do they dream about probably the same things we do probably flying but or seconds for them you know mm thats all for chickens yeah got to save some for the memoir yeah yeah yeah yeah let me see what else i can tell you about that has been going on chickens oh yeah i got kicked out of show business yeah yeah thanks yeah cause im mean yeah you cant be mean and be in show business no theyll kick you out no mean people in show business im out yeah yall heard i was mean everybody heard that i was mean everywhere i go i know everyones heard that im mean i know when i walk into a restaurant people are watching waiting to see if ill be mean do you think shell be mean first and then dance look she oh shes reaching for butter i thought she was gonna hit somebody all right im gonna eat you watch now that was a big story huh that had some legs on it the first i heard about it i i came across a headline that said how ellen degeneres became the most hated person in america now i didnt see the other names on the ballot but i have to yeah its its an impressive title it really is its a its a horrible thing to say about somebody and to make it worse there was no trophy no awards banquet nothing just the title just you know i made a sash at home and i wore that around just to to feel like i had something you know it was quite a shock to me because for years there were all these polls basically saying i was one of the most trusted people in the country there was a poll that asked people which celebrity would you most want to babysit your child and i was the number one answer because when you think good with kids you immediately think childless lesbian standup comedian once they heard that i might be mean they didnt want me to babysit anymore so it wasnt all bad no i was in therapy for a while trying to deal with all the hatred coming at me and it was not a common situation for a therapist to deal with my therapist said ellen where do you get this idea that everyone hates you and i said well um new york times washington post entertainment weekly us weekly i think elmo may have said something recently on an episode of sesame street she said you just need to avoid looking at the news just avoid media and i was like i am im not looking at anything i would know when something was going on because id start getting text from friends saying thinking of you or sending love and id be like oh why do i need love sent the be kind girl wasnt kind that was the headline heres the problem im a comedian who got a talk show and i ended the show every day by saying be kind to one another yeah i know it seemed like a good idea but i became a brand a onedimensional character who gave stuff away and danced every day up steps do you know how hard it was to dance up steps would a mean person dance up steps i dont think so had i ended my show by saying go fuck yourselves people would have been pleasantly surprised to find out im kind i loved that show i loved everything about that show it was a family to me heres something sweet sixteen people who worked there started out straight and by the time they left were gay yeah you dont see jimmy kimmel doing those kind of numbers you know whats funny is that when i first came out people were afraid that watching my show would turn people gay which is ridiculous you have to work there you have to fill out a and then you turn gay we had so much fun together at that show we laughed all the time we played games all the time i started a game of tag in like that we played all the way till when the show ended cause i just loved playing games we played tag and i would chase people down the hallways i would chase them around the studio and scare them all the time i would jump out scare people cause i would love to do that and hearing myself say this out loud i realize i was chasing my employees and terrorizing them i can see where that would be misinterpreted well we had morning meetings every morning in my office the producers would come in writers would come in and wed talk about what we were gonna do on the show that day and andy lassner was one of my executive producers yeah uh andy is a very nervous man and he everything scares him he could drop his pen and it would startle him hes just a nervous man and alison was one of my writers who was scared of snakes anything snakerelated so sometimes before theyd come into my office we would hide rubber snakes in a panel in the ceiling and i had a button that i could push that would release the snakes down again hearing myself say this out loud but they liked it they did there are a lot of perks with having your own television show number one has to be the ability to say to someone we should have a panel in the ceiling that releases snakes and then another adult says yeah well get that started right away scaring was just a big component of the show we would you know we started with scaring guests and i dont remember exactly how it started it was some simple like i think chris hemsworth or some big strong guy that was on the show we found out was scared of crickets so we had someone dress as a cricket and sneak up behind his chair when he was talking and you know make a cricket noise and scare him and then it just escalated we just decided to make it more surprising to people and eventually we uh built a table that looked like the table between me and the guest but it was actually a box where someone could pop out and scare them but the guests got wise to that and if they saw that it was a box they would open it and look in the box so we built a tunnel under the stage that went into the box so that when they checked it it was empty and then theyd close it and somebody would crawl into the box from underneath i was a very immature boss i didnt want to be a boss i didnt go to business school i went to charlies chuckle hut it looked like i was the boss the show is called ellen and everybodys wearing tshirts that say ellen and there were buildings all over the warner bros lot that said ellen but i dont think that meant that i should be in charge i dont think that ronald mcdonalds the ceo of mcdonalds everything i knew about being a boss i learned from movies and those were things like saying jenkins my office now or the names frank how the hell are you but those were men bosses women bosses didnt come along for a while not till around the time of martinizing i think no but men bosses and women bosses are different like a woman boss couldnt say jenkins my office now a woman boss would have to use more words a woman boss would have to say something like excuse me jenkins i dont want to bother you if youre not too busy could you step into my office real quick i just have to talk to you for a second thank you so much cause women are raised in a different way at least i was i was raised to be a people pleaser i was taught when i was a little girl to be small and quiet and agreeable and its crazy what ive done with my life cause im exactly the opposite of how i was raised to be yeah most women arent raised with confidence we just arent were too selfconscious which is why you rarely see a woman playing air guitar i love how they make it like its hard like somethings happening there men can get away with acting out things that arent actually happening and not look crazy somehow a man in the middle of nowhere and for no reason can practice an imaginary golf swing just oh no im not in line im just waiting for my latte you go ahead menll jump up and see if they can slap the top of a doorframe ive never had that urge i wonder if i could hit that tiffany hold my purse im gonna give it a try i couldnt do it i didnt give me my purse i didnt do it good we have all these unwritten rules based on gender of acceptable behavior of who were allowed to be and how were allowed to act if we dont follow those rules it makes people uncomfortable when people get uncomfortable there are consequences for those of you keeping score this is the second time ive been kicked out of show business yeah kicked me out before cause i told them i was gay no gay people in show business no theyll kick you out cant be gay and be in show business eventually theyre gonna kick me out a third time for being old mean old and gay the triple crown i knew it was a risk to tell people i was gay cause i knew a lot of people didnt like gay people if they did we wouldnt have needed the parade listen we dont like all of you either but we dont make a big thing about it most of us get into this business because we didnt get enough love or attention as a child so we go into a business that depends on people liking us to be successful whats wrong with us for me it was never about the money it was about healing my childhood wounds i thought if i could make people happy then theyll like me and if they like me ill feel good about myself and all i can say about that is thank god for the money cause its a fickle business they liked me for a long time i was on a sitcom i made them laugh they liked me then i told them i was gay and they didnt like me then i got a talk show and i gave them tvs and cars and i danced and they liked me then they heard a rumor i was mean they didnt like me so its been a real test for my ego and my selfesteem because theres such extremes in this business there are people who love you and idolize you and then there are people who hate you just really loudly hate you so sometimes i long for my childhood when i just had good oldfashioned neglect what was wrong with that its been two years since the show ended and its been an adjustment because for years i drove onto the warner bros lot passed a giant billboard of my face so the first thing i did was i had a giant billboard of my face installed on my lawn so i saw that when i drove in yeah then i put an applause sign in the dining room and thats helping also but really ive only known myself working for years thats all ive done is work so i didnt really have a lot of free time and didnt have hobbies now theres a lot of free time so im trying to figure out what to do with that so i got the chickens remember i dont know if you yeah i decided to take up gardening cause everybody talks about gardening and how great gardening is its not no its really not i got the overalls and the tool belt and the hat i looked adorable i did but i find once you put the plants in the ground youre no longer gardening youre just waiting you know i tell people i grew these strawberries but at best i was just there when it happened its the sun and the sprinklers that should take the credit im more like the strawberries godmother showing up on its birthday look how big youre getting see you at christmas maybe it is relaxing to be out there though mainly cause the garden gloves make it impossible for me to look at my phone yeah sometimes ill put the garden gloves on and go inside and lay down yeah its just as relaxing really my garden gloves and my sweatpants i live in sw when im at home i just wear sweatpants i dont understand people who dont just wear sweatpants at home like whats the point you know yeah i take off my goingout clothes i take those off put on my stayinghome clothes once im in my sweatpants im not leaving not leaving the house a few weeks ago a friend of mine texted me and he said would you like to come over for a lastminute dinner party for mick as in jagger now ive never met mick jagger and i would love to meet mick jagger but i was in my sweatpants already and i was not leaving thats what i told him and he could not believe that was the reason i wasnt going i guess most people would make something up because it is a ridiculous reason and i know that but it was the truth you know and you know people say honesty is the best policy i dont know why they say that its only the best policy if its something you want to hear really like there are certain degrees of honesty if you tell someone theres something stuck in their teeth they dont love that but they kind of appreciate that and theyll take that but as soon as you tell someone that all of their stories should be shorter yeah you lose of their friendship is what happens people say its hard to tell the truth for me its hard not to tell the truth which is why it was really difficult for me to keep my sexuality a secret because i felt such guilt for not being honest about who i was i felt shame for how society was making me feel i felt fear for what would happen to my career if i did come out ultimately i decided its more important for me to be honest about who i am yeah yeah they say the truth will set you free and it did i was free for three years nobody would hire me truth will make you broke people lie so much these days they really do you can tell because they make such a big deal of it when theyre telling the truth theyll say things like well to tell you the truth or if im being honest if youre being honest i prefer it the other way around listen im gonna lie to you here that lasagna was phenomenal most people tell me that they appreciate my honesty because they know where they stand with me but someone did suggest that i get tested to see if im on the spectrum and uh im not on the spectrum and i wouldnt care if i was on the spectrum but im not well i am on the spectrum we all are its a spectrum im on the part of the spectrum where someone on the spectrum would have a problem with me saying im on the spectrum so yeah thats right but i may have ocd because a therapist said so and i said yes i am very organized because i thought that was the o i didnt know what ocd was i was raised in a religion christian science that doesnt acknowledge diseases or disorders so when i was growing up nobody talked about anything there was no discussion of anything i look back now and i realize my dad for sure had ocd he would check the doorknob times before we would leave he would check the faucet times he would unplug all the appliances before we left the house because lightning could strike and it would catch fire they say it could be hereditary so i went home and i asked portia i said do you think i may have ocd and she said yes you do barely got that sentence out really its funny ive never thought of myself as obsessive i think of myself as careful and everyone else careless and out of control i asked her what i obsess about and she said you obsess about time and that is true i dont like to be late i like to be on time so sometimes that makes us early this is the example she said i should share with you i um there are many but this is the one she said usher was having an afterparty for the grammys one year and we got there so early it was just us and the staff yup yup we helped place candles on tables i invoiced him these are my confessions i just dont know why the invitation says a certain time for a party to start and then everyone goes an hour or two later people seem to think that means means means means nothing to me cause im not going who starts something at anyway i obsess on time and uh i obsess on animals i know i obsess on animals cause i love them too much like way too much i think about how they see things and what they feel and what they think and i worry about butterflies in rainstorms and how delicate they are and how their little tiny feet are holding on to a blade of grass trying to winds blowing the rain is happening on their little tiny wings saturating their wings and their feet holding especially if its a butterfly what if its his first day and theyre like is this life this is horrible ooh i should have stayed a caterpillar the monarch butterfly think about that how crazy is that story you know the story i dont have to tell you but i will the little tiny caterpillar i mean how does it even make it past the caterpillar stage its a larva and then that somehow gets into a caterpillar and a caterpillar just and somehow it just knows instinctively its time for that part of its life to change thats done im gonna put myself into a chrysalis and then it turns into liquid somehow and then it becomes a butterfly flying for the first time and it looks drunk and confused the way they you know and they make it to mexico that way i dont know how the butterfly is beautiful and people talk about the butterfly but the butterfly wouldnt be the butterfly without the caterpillar i mean the deep knowing that that caterpillar has its only perspective is crawling on the ground and its looking at other crawling things saying im gonna fly someday and im gonna go to mexico and theyre like no youre not and whats mexico but i dont know if we really fully appreciate what that metamorphosis is the fact that its a caterpillar it knows to change and becomes this other thing entirely thats genius its brilliance and the octopus the octopus being able to change texture and shape and form and color instantaneously depending on what its on thats genius a colony of ants or of bees the way they communicate and theres no chaos between all of those things everything in nature is living up to its full potential but i am so disappointed in pigeons what happened to them i mean pigeons they have builtin gps in their beaks and they can fly for hundreds of miles in world war ii they saved lives they were taking messages from generals to other generals and saving lives there are pictures of them in the newspaper with medals not pinned but around their necks that they received for what they did in world war ii and now look at them just pecking at old gum in filthy alleyways and parking lots they could be anywhere i would feel sorry for them but they made a choice i mean they barely fly anymore they theyre just uh filthy and even if a car is coming they dont even fly to get out of the way all right okay all right okay all right okay okay all right okay sometimes it looks like theyre gonna do something important youll see a bunch and they all get up at once again that kind of communication all of them get up at once they fly and they just go in one big circle and they go right back to where they were god you guys not living up to their potential i rescued a pigeon one time ill rescue anything ive always tried to save animals my whole life but i saw a onelegged pigeon on the street near where i lived and i took it home because i knew it wasnt gonna make it on the street and i didnt know how to take care of it i mean never had a pigeon so i just threw gum and trash down dirt thinking thats what it eats you know because ive never seen it it didnt make it ill rescue anything i really will and if i see a sign of someone posting a cat or a dog missing when they post those pictures i will drive around and i will try to find that animal and its not just for the reward money its not no i rescued a dog one time i was driving and i see this dog all by itself and i get out of the car and its soaking wet im like oh my god what happened to you take it home dry it off stays with me for the night put out posters the next afternoon get a call from the people saying thank god where did you find it and i told them and they said thats where we live yeah they said we had just given it a bath and we put her on the lawn to dry out it was pretty close to the sidewalk when i saw it anyway i obsess on things i have add and i blame the talk show for that because for years i was talking to people in fiveminute segments when im at a party and someones talking to me longer than five minutes i have the urge to say im sorry we have to take a break parties are hard for me parties are very hard for me people are wanting to talk and stuff and they always talk about books theyre reading i dont read i want to i try to read but my add makes it really hard for me as much as i try to focus on the words i end up thinking about a sandwich i had earlier that day moby dick for me is two pages about a whale and pages about me wondering if i should grow my hair out or keep it short ive had it short for a while i should try to grow it out probably maybe to my shoulderlength or something like that not much longer than that i wonder how long that would take though i should probably keep it short i think thats better why not try something different though i should oh yeah oh its done yeah yeah my add makes it really hard for me to sit down and focus on anything at all like do you know how hard it was for me to put this together of course you dont why would i ask that question why do people ask people questions they know they dont have the answer to why do people say guess what i did yesterday do i have to is it a game is there a prize i dont want to youll never guess what i did yesterday youre right i wont i wont probably not unless its something really average like you had lunch you said ill never guess so its probably something weird like you got a chinchilla and named it stewart i dont know so its hard for me to focus and i get like when i was thinking about pigeons and how disappointed i was in them i was i remembered that i had rescued the pigeon cause id forgotten i was like yeah i rescued that onelegged pigeon and when i wrote down legged i did the hyphen thing and i thought legged or legged is it legged onelegged onelegged pigeon or onelegged its not one armmed you dont one armmed armed but its two gs so legged you dont go i begged for food no you dont stay i got mugged its legged or legged oneleg pigeon onelegged onelegged oneleg pigeon onelegged oneleg pigeon onelegged pigeon a oneleg onelegged oneleg pigeon onelegged pigeon so i have add i have ocd im losing my memory but i think im welladjusted because i obsess on things but dont have the attention span to stick with it then i forget what i was obsessing about in the first place so it takes me all the way around to being welladjusted i think yeah im very impatient that is a problem for me im very impatient its hard for me to live in the moment were supposed to live in the moment but every moment eh the spiritual teacher ram dass wrote a book called be here now id like to write one for people with add and call it yeah but whats that over there there are all these books out there telling us how to live telling us why were here cause why are we here really i mean obviously to gossip and make fun of each other on the internet but why else these things i think about now that im older im years old and i thank you thats how you know youre old you get the applause you dont get it when youre or even in your it starts around so i dont like the word old i think its a bad word it just sounds bad old is that bread still good no thats old old and i dont feel old the only time i feel old is when im in a restaurant trying to read a menu that is the only time i feel old yeah you know all the reasons its like too dark in there its always too dark and the way they think theyre gonna help they put a tealight candle on the table which does nothing i blow it out i just blow it out and oh okay youre gonna light it again all right im just gonna because it doesnt do anything thats why why are you lighting okay ill do it again im just gonna put it in my pocket how about that you cant see and if you put your flashlight on your phone to try to read the menu that just automatically says old thats just thats they should come with a sound effect when you put the flashlight on old it should just be old and even if you can see the print is so small i dont know who is printing these menus but the print is so tiny its like theyre using a jewelers loupe to make the font its tiny tiny font you cant read it im like can you see that does that say tortilla or trampoline what does that say to you i cant see anything yeah hi okay ill go ahead and order im gonna get the pasta with stem cells they have a childrens menu they should have a largerprint menu for older people with a bendy light so you can see it or even better they should come out in audiobook a menu could be an audio meryl streep reads the cheesecake factory pancakes i dont do impressions thats pancakes when youre this age the doctors start asking you to come in for checkups even though theres nothing wrong with you they just want to see you its a scam theyre just looking for stuff they ask you all kinds of personal stuff how many drinks per week do you have first of all its none of your business second of all im gonna lie to you here three drinks per week how about i start with per day before i do that math okay carry the two they just look for stuff my doctor said whens the last time you had a bone density test and i said a what bone density test i said ive never had a bone density test well at your age you should get one i said why im in good shape no you should get one at your age so i got the stupid bone density test im off the charts below it i have fullon osteoporosis i dont even know how im standing up right now im like a human sandcastle i could disintegrate in the shower i have to take that prolia shot every six months remember the commercial where the womans walking and a kid darts out on the skateboard or something whoa whoa thats me its hard to be honest about aging and seem cool hey if you got arthritis in your knee make some noise oh me too i just had excruciating pain one day and i thought i tore a ligament or something i got the mri and theyre like no its just arthritis i said howd i get that he goes it just happens at your age all these things just happen at your age its around the time you start watching wheel of fortune yeah theres no buildup you just find yourself sitting there enjoying it one day thats a pretty gown vannas wearing the prizes are tricky on there i find i think they really are i had a conversation about this the other day if you land on the dollar amount the or the you get that right but if you land on the car honk honk half a car by the way youre trying to land on the million dollars thats what you want but the million dollars is sandwiched in between two bankrupts if you freezeframe it youll notice that the bankrupts are a little bit larger than the sliver of the million dollars youll see when you freezeframe it its just when you land on it youre like i got a million dollars but no you dont you have to have so many other things that line up to get that which i was telling myself when portia walked in and said who are you talking to another thing that happens when you age you just start talking to yourself id probably be doing this exact same thing right now if you werent here aging is very interesting aging is tough on its own but aging then you have aging parents which a lot of people are dealing with now which is really really tough my father is no longer with us well he was never with you um my mother has dementia now and um which is a horrible disease and so many people are dealing with it right now my mother is lucky in the sense that she doesnt know she has it so shes actually happy shes really happy shes in a really nice place i have her in uh a facility that they have a lot of activities to keep them stimulated theres painting and arts and crafts and bus rides and different things that happen um i dont know whose idea this was but someone booked a magician he he was so excited to be there he was wearing a tuxedo that fit him at one point in his life and hes sitting and hes got a table thirteen women in different stages of dementia and pick a card eh i cant see it what is it its a queen of hearts no dont tell her i want you to look at it and just you just look at that and remember it okay all right put it back in the deck now he goes through the whole thing is this your card no yes it is yes thats your card no you picked that card put it back in oh he got so mad he just he didnt even have to do anything he could have left the room and come back oh a magician you know they would have been like god its always interesting having a conversation with her you never know what youre gonna get and not too long ago she said you didnt go to college did you i said no she goes thats a shame i would have been so proud of you i said well i think i did okay i had that show you liked remember the show yeah i still watch it every day i said no i dont think so um yeah i watch it every day i said no its not on anymore and she goes then who am i watching kelly clarkson judge judy i dont know well yesterdays was very good it was the best one yet okay you know i realize now that my whole life was wrapped up in that show and my mothers whole identity was being ellens mom and now i dont have a show and she doesnt know shes my mom she just thinks im a nice lady that visits her although theres a good chance she thinks im kelly ripa but but shes happy and thats all that matters and im happy too uh yeah im happy not being a boss or a brand or a billboard just a person just a multifaceted person with different feelings and emotions and i can be happy and sad and compassionate or frustrated i have ocd and add im honest im generous im sensitive and thoughtful but im tough and im impatient and im demanding im direct im a strong woman thank you thank you thank you so much im proud of who ive become when youre a public figure youre open to everyones interpretation im sure youve heard the saying what other people think of me is none of my business people will say all kinds of things and you have no control over that but you know the truth and thats all that matters but that is easier said than done because being in this business i have had to care what people think because being a comedian or a host its our only real currency for success if they like you youre in and if they dont youre out and ive spent an entire lifetime trying to make people happy and ive cared far too much what other people think of me so the thought of anyone thinking that im mean was devastating to me and it consumed me for a long time but with time you gain perspective which is one good thing about aging it doesnt totally make up for arthritis and brittle bones but but with perspective you realize that caring what people think to a degree is healthy but not if it affects your mental health so after a lifetime of caring i just cant anymore so i dont but if im being honest and i have a choice of people remembering me as someone who is mean or someone who is beloved beloveed beloved beloved someone who is beloved someone who is beloveed beloved beloveded someone whos beloved someone who is beloveded someone who is beloved i choose that thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you have a seat thank you so much wow wow well wow um first of all first of all that was just um unbelievably beautiful and um you know there is just nothing better than being surrounded by endorphins and joy and we dont get that that often now and this was beautiful tonight this was absolutely i um i had no intention of doing a special i had no intention of doing anything ever again after the show and i really uh i didnt think id ever find the funny in it and the fact that i have been able to travel and do this and see the love and support that is still there for me which i didnt know i had um it is its been its been beyond healing to say the words every night toto feel the support and the love and so i am so glad i got to do this im so glad i got to say goodbye on my terms and i cant thank you enough um this is a night i will always remember and uh i i just i just thank you and i just want to bring my wife out here cause its our anniversary shes crying thank you everybody thank you thank you  im taking my freedom   pulling it off the shelf   putting it on my chain   wearing it around my neck   im taking my freedom   putting it in my car

slowly thats right you a pedophile for my baby you going to jail you sick fuck cause you wanna joebidensniff my baby people say wild shit to me now that i have a kid you know what i mean real maniacal evil shit i had a stranger ive never met before in my life come up to me the other day and tell me having a baby is the best thing thats ever gonna happen to me the best thing and keep in mind i once met forest whitaker in line at an ihop ghost dog i met him at the international house this is how it happened right i was in line minding my business and out of nowhere forest whitaker walked in and he asked to use the bathroom and then the woman behind the register she looked at him she realized holy shit thats forest whitaker and then she said the bathroom was for paying customers only and forest whitaker couldnt believe it he was taken aback he looked at her as if to say maam have you lost your mind im forest goddamn whitaker youve seen my eye but the woman didnt budge a bit she just looked right back at him and rolled her neck as if to say sir you aint special this is an ihop everybodys got a fuckedup eye we all fuckedup in the hop thats how we got here and there was this crazy standoff right between forest whitaker and the pancake lady neither one of them budging a bit and then out of nowhere my boy will he was outside smoking he comes back in he sees forest whitaker he goes oh shit forest whitaker you eat at ihop weird choice and ill never forget it because academyawardwinner forest whitaker he looked at us he looked at everybody in the restaurant and he just went man fuck yall best thing know why best thing is crazy because you and i every single person in this room weve all had so many magical experiences that no human should ever have to weigh themselves against know what i mean its almost unfair to ask you to compare your greatest joys to another its look hey ive gotten pussy and cinnabon in the same night thats a miracle this is a better example okay here it is okay this okay last year for my birthday right me and my friends we did a shitton of mushrooms right we got superhigh on mushrooms real fucked up on mushrooms and then we went to a public park we sat on a bench and then we heckled an adult softball league you understand thats how i celebrated my birthday and ill be honest thats the best thing thats ever happened to me so much funnier than a baby this is why it was dope because those people had paid money to be there the players they had worked hard to organize themselves with registration fees and uniforms all under the guise of spending this peaceful afternoon in the park playing sports with their friends and then out of nowhere a group of urban youth white people cant tell how old we are a group of urban youth some rowdy eighth graders showed up and just started yelling weird mushroomy shit at them stuff that didnt even make sense i was sitting on a bench like hey number three you remember bob dole you know bob dole he was a politician ran for president never won you remember bob dole remember he had that weird fuckedup arm little arm he had to keep a pen in it so nobodyd notice how mangled his little hand was remember bob dole well you throw like bob dole fuck you number three bobdolethrowing motherfucker this was the best part of the afternoon at one point at one point the um the the the left fielder and i guess im cautious to call him a left fielder because he was very clearly an office manager you know what i mean he wasnt left field by trade but the office manager in left field he missed an easy pop fly right easy pop fly goes over his head he falls down super embarrassing moment and then i took it upon myself i stood up in front of everybody at the park i stood up and i shouted hey im not angry but your mother and i are very disappointed i shouted that in front of everybody and what yall have to understand is that that joke did fine here fine yall are cool but at the park i fucking killed you know what i mean yall are okay but at the park i goddamn destroyed me and my friends we were highfiving and shit jogging bitches they stopped they were laughing the mexican man with the popsicles he winked at me gave me a free snoopy destroyed right but heres what you also have to understand is that when i said that i was on mushrooms right i was as high as the day is long so when i said that and me and this person in left field made eye contact there was a brief moment where i was his father you understand i was this white mans dad and ill be honest i was disappointed because this isnt the life that i imagined for my white son maybe thats good enough for your white boys but not mine no sir his mother and i had worked too hard too hard to give him a life he didnt even earn we paid off the dui we bribed the college admissions offices we introduced him to people named humphrey and all we ever asked of him was that he not shame us dont embarrass us in this public way and i got so angry so in my head rageful at what my son was doing that out of nowhere i shouted i shouted in front of everybody hey im selling the house in the berkshires and im cutting you out of the trust and then no one laughed cause no one knew what the fuck i was talking about mexican man took back his popsicle gimme that shit thought you were funny youre weird youre a weird guy at the park best thing youre telling me im the best thing thats ever happened to my parents you youre the best thing thats ever happened to your parents most of us still get embarrassed when we have to read out loud the other day i was reading my daughter a bedtime story and i ran into the word pterodactyl fucked up my whole evening i was just sitting there like what the fuck is a peterodasatill see see see this is the government trying to put the names of prescription drug medications in our childrens books they trying to get my baby hooked on this shit they trying to make my daughter a peterohead cant be the best thing man theres so much im dumb about so much i dont understand in the world okay great example lets talk about this as it relates to covid right specifically the covid vaccine am i the only person am i the only one in this room who thought walgreens would have a separate staff you know like for the medical interventions i thought thered be like walgreens doctors and walgreens nurses its not its the same nggas its the same people who sell you batteries some of yall dont get it listen hey hey the key for the deodorant and the key for the moderna its on the same ring its just one dude being like whatcha need player yeah i got you oh pfizer nah i cant get you the pfizer gotta call the manager for the pfizer you want that johnson johnson i get you that right now we keep that with the hot pockets i can get you johnson johnson but pfizer we gotta call the manager he got the big key also please fill out this form because i am now your primary care physician we gon change up your diet you eating string cheese its on sale cant be the best thing man i still get hard when i aint supposed to be hard know what i mean thats not a threat i dont like how youre looking thats not im not threatening you you enjoy your evening im saying i get boners when i didnt expect to have a boner like when im waiting for the train everybody be looking at me like damn he really loves the train but i dont im not a train guy im not i just cant help it i and i used to think it was just a me thing you know i used to think i was the only person hard in my local chipotle but after years of careful research ive come to discover its not just a me thing in fact every dude in here has the exact same problem ladies whether hes ready to admit it or not every dude has found himself at work just in a marketing meeting with a throbbing erection he cant explain just avoiding pie charts cause those are making it worse somehow like oh god are we at lord im about to bust i cant i pray to god they dont push that pie chart next to another pie chart cause thats titties and imma cum imma cum from that pie booty we cant control our bodies thats why i dont listen to anything men have to say about reproductive responsibility and the women no cause we be hard we be hard and if you got a hard dick you should maybe tuck it in your belt and shut the fuck up im not trying to hear your harddick opinion you cant be erect and correct at the same time thank you hey imma run for president imma be up there giving speeches hard as hell like damn putin got them big bombs dont he shit putin bombs look like titties fuck big ol titty bombs i think i just have fear about what it means to raise a child you know to bring a person to their greatest potential thats scary fear honestly that existed throughout my wifes entire pregnancy terrified genuinely afraid the entire time i was terrified i was gonna end up with a white baby terrified and ill explain it its not as confusing as you think it is im biracial right my mothers black my father is white my wife is the exact same mix so if im halfwhite and shes halfwhite and recessive genes kick in we could end up with a fucking daywalker a little surprise white baby just a little tamponcolored tyler with varicose veins talking bout daddy im in the mood for poached eggs ew i dont want a white baby i dont want a baby that ages like a gypsy curse why does this baby look older than me i hate it hate this white baby and i dont have anything against white people i dont honestly im a big fan of your work i really am rollerblades yall did that dont let anybody tell you you aint make rollerblades yall are the reason we shred like i said man my fathers white so i okay this is the best way this is it okay it here it is its hard to blame the white man for all of your problems when the white man still pays your cell phone bill im on the devils family plan i cant i cant be that you know what i mean i cant be up here like brothers and sisters i said brothers and sisters and maybe even vin diesel its hard to tell with him what color is that exactly periwinkle looking like a oldass cauliflower anyway we must overthrow the white man we must bring every single white person to justice except for the white people who send me money on my birthday also the entire cast of the office they are hilarious and whichever white person invented fruit on the bottom of yogurt i tried it i love it i love it the other day i ate a boysenberry flavor i took a good healthy poop and i thought oh this is why white people act like that too much power i feel too strong i want to open a private prison and use a neti pot i love it take my shoes off on a plane i love it feels good fear know what my biggest fear is with a kid genuinely this is my biggest fear is how do you make your kid into a good person do you know what i mean if you have kids if youre a parent and i think we can all agree on this youre just guessing all of us youre we plug in a formula we plug in the exact same formula you teach em to share you give them motherfuckers vegetables and shit and then you just hope you just hope your kid doesnt into like a serial killer or even worse one of those people who draws lion king characters with human titties you remember those psychopaths in school those future republican senators any cartoon titty kids here tonight anybody want to fess up to what they did nobody ever raises their hand but statistically that cant be correct the math dont check out cause every class i was in id look over and some kid was disgracing the disney corporation and lets be clear ladies and gentlemen thats not what walt disney wanted walt walter disney walt disney wanted good wholesome content also to exterminate the jews he wanted dead jews and good familyfriendly content and now you look over and some kid is drawing zazu just the bird from lion king with big heavy lunch lady titties big casserole and spatula titties now the bird cant fly talking about simba i cant help you become king my back hurts what god would make me like this simba kill me how do you make them good this is a this is a weird transition after that titty joke but i used to be a high school teacher thats what i did before comedy i taught and grade english im the reason your kid pronounces it liberry i coulda helped i chose not to i wanted to see them flail teachings tough man it you this is what made teaching so difficult for me is that no matter how challenging a kid is right no matter how difficult a kid is you have to maintain this hope this faith that they can still grow into better people right that they can still find the best version of themselves and thats so hard because so many kids deserve to be pepper sprayed right they deserve to be maced in their fucking eyeballs until they learn to contribute to society some of the meanest things ever said to me came from children not my enemies little unwashed people motherfuckers who dont wipe so good this is the meanest thing anyones ever said to me i had a little girl raise her hand middle of class she raised her hand to tell me she didnt think i could ever become a professional male model because i have too much adult acne you understand she interrupted class to tell me keep in mind i wasnt trying to be a male model at all i wasnt doing nothing sexy i was trying to teach this bitch to read but something so hateful in her spirit saw me up there trying my best and she thought to herself uhuh uhuh no way uhuh fuck that uhuh this motherfuckers got too much confidence no this bumpyfaced ngga he believes in himself too much i need to let him know that just in case he was thinking about changing careers male model is not an option i know hes trying to make us think critically about literature but fuck that he needs to think about the back of a proactiv bottle his skin is terrible he looks like multigrain imma tell him imma tell him he looks like bread there are kids who i taught that i still want to fight to this day to this day theres this little bitch named edna ill decap ednas knees if i ever see her again this is really what i want some of yall might work in education i think thisll make sense i want to stab edna in the stomach right i wanna knife her up real good in the belly and then afterward i want to stuff the wound with hot cheetos so shed die all spicy and shit fucking hate edna ednas the reason i stopped writing poetry you understand she stole the magic of verse from me let me be clear this wasnt my original dream i didnt want to perform behind a bar you know what i mean i wanted to be a poet i was oh man im telling you i was going to be a poet i yall i i was gonna write silky metaphors i was gonna wear a thick tweed jacket i was going to go down on weird ladies with hairy armpits i was going to be a poet and then i had to teach an afterschool poetry program for ednas class and every day for eight consecutive weeks that little girl hurt my feelings she made me sad for two lunar cycles and now i want her dead this was a poetry class and this is where i messed up this was my mistake im going to admit that up top this is where i messed up i thought the best way to get these kids to write their poems was for me to share one of my own right huge mis right yeah i get it i fucked up i should have just read them tupac lyrics like my teachers did for me listen up kids first off fuck yo bitch and the clique you claim thats called a stanza even worse the poem that i read them was a poem that meant a lot to me at the time it was a poem about a friend of mine who died in a car crash this girl i know who died in a car crash and in the poem i do all this metaphorical work to compare her death to the death of a spider i found in my windowsill and the final lines of the poem go the exact final lines of the poem go how close to god this spider must feel weaving a world above the earth the string as thin as breath the breath so easily silenced a net of wings fluttering toward blind quiet before i could even finish before anyone even had a chance to process the words coming out of my mouth edna just went damn this poetry nggas gay as hell fucking bitch i oughta kill this stupid little bitch ill punch you in the head stupid bitch punch you dead in your fucking face kids break you they break the person you thought you were going to be and then we subsequently break them and it becomes this ugly cycle of broken people this is a great example of what i mean years ago i read this article about a teacher in idaho right teacher in idaho who got fired from his job he got arrested he got taken to jail because he brought a puppy to school to show his class right seems harmless enough he brought a puppy to the school he showed the puppy to his students and then afterwards he fed that puppy to the classs pet snapping turtle everybody okay i didnt do it im just a reporter you understand he fed a baby dog to a living dinosaur in front of children and every article i read had the same reaction many of you are having every single one was like oh my god what kind of irreparable damage has this man done to these kids what kind of permanent damage has he done to these poor kids and i kept reading those articles and thinking about my experience as a teacher and i kept thinking man fuck those kids fuck them what kind of permanent damage did those kids do to him cause he wasnt like that at the beginning of the year he didnt start off that way that wasnt written in the syllabus they broke him they broke his brain they taunted him and they teased him and they took pictures of his paycheck and they posted it on the internet till one day he snapped and he found himself holding a dog over this ravenous reptile staring out at like is this what you want are you not entertained i swear to god if one more of yall brings up my divorce ill kill this fucking dog todays lesson is about minding your goddamn business turn to page okay this next selection from sunset singles this next piece i want to share with you is a personal favorite its a personal favorite its a little number that ive simply entitled sophisticated sophisticated well play it for you now hello this is joe calling you have a very sophisticated voice as well as a very sophisticated oh you must be a very sophisticated person id love to meet up with you if youd like to have a drink im a lawyer give me a call if you would at area code okay first of all first of all can anyone hear definitively prove that that wasnt joe biden can you definitively prove that that wasnt americas horniest president whos trying to stutter his way into a little side malarkey you know little malarkey on the side and for those of you pulling back because i do see some of you youre getting out yeah youre wondering maybe this is too far let me remind you im trying to have sex with him hes not a victim in this situation hes a man who im trying to give some pussy im a hero in this story how do you make a good person people say love love you know the thing that flavor flav and brigitte nielsen have they say thats how you make a good person i dont know if i believe in that i dont know if i still believe in love honestly i just found out that my wife thinks that im special needs and yes she means it in a derogatory way shes a bad lady she should go to jail lock her up the other day she called me from work and she said this to me verbatim verbatim this is what she said to me now keep in mind i have changed some of the words to make me sound better and her sound worse but verbatim this is what she said to me she called me up and she said hey im making chili tonight and i need you to heat up a can of beans then she said and ill never forget it and whatever you do dont put the can in the microwave you understand she told me her emergency contact not to put a can and when she said that i took a deep breath you know i took a deep breath and i really thought about all the time weve spent together the love that weve shared the bond that weve built i took a deep breath and then finally very calmly i said i said i said bitch ill fucking kill you i will kill you dead i will take that gun that we bought after white people tried to take back the country from other white people and i will shoot you in the leg is that what you think of me that im metalinamicrowave stupid you let me cum inside of you you let that cum become a person you leave me alone for hours completely unsupervised with that cum not to mention all those loose cans of beans and this whole time she just been thinking damn i bet some day he gon kill himself with a microwave i bet some day he gon put a can of spaghettios in the microwave push the popcorn button and blow his fucking face off and then our daughters gonna have to grow up in a world where people refer to her dumbass daddy as orville deadenbacher its a long way for a pun some say too long thats critique ive heard too long love you want to talk about love my mom my mom has been married four times to four different men four thats a jodecis worth of husbands some of yall are white thats a degrees worth of husbands for the older people jersey boys four different husbands and sometimes i think my moms the only person whos truly figured love out you know what i mean shes the only person who figured out what love is supposed to be because while the rest of us have potentially wasted our lives trying to find some perfect special someone who may not even exist instead my mom gets married every el ni\\u00f1o she finds a new husband every other toyotathon and she just be having fun out there shell marry anybody oldass karate students grown men who order apple juice at restaurants at one point im not making this up my mom married a disgraced nba mascot yeah thats not a mad lib thats a choice she made in front of god and the government and all right lets just start from the beginning ill walk you you have questions i have answers first of all did you know that nba mascots could be disgraced no even worse did you know these disgraced motherfuckers could fuck your mom apparently it could happen to any of us apparently none of our mothers can resist the sexual chemistry of a dishonorably discharged benny the bull my mom married benny the bull and not at his best no dont clap for that shame on you its hurting my family and the next question youre naturally asking you want to know how did he lose his job as benny the bull right how does one lose such a coveted position as chicago mascot benny the bull ill tell you he was fired from his job as benny the bull because and im not making this up in he got caught selling drugs after a game in full costume just standing in the parking lot even the police walked up like benny what are you doing those are your work clothes he was arrested he was banned from the stadium for life and my personal favorite detail they added his name to the wikipedia page when you go home tonight look it up yourself go to wikipediaorgbennythebull and then when youre there scroll down to a section entitled scandals and there you will read about possibly the dumbest man for whom ive ever had to buy a fathers day card love what is it even mean to be a good person you know what i mean given the state of the world what does good person even really mean all of our heroes are monsters and all of our monsters have podcasts what does good person even mean i dont there is no good and bad its not just good and bad its not just right and wrong its not just darkskinned sammy sosa and hellokittycolored sammy sosa there are so many different shades of sammy sosa inbetween my personal favorite tapioca sosa good and bad thats all bullshit this is a great example this is a perfect metaphor of what im trying to say my favorite restaurant in the world my absolute favorite restaurant in the world is mcdonalds how dare you watch your goddamn mouth i love mcdonalds i dont care what anybody says i love it its i love everything about it i like the food i like the service when people show me fight videos at mcdonalds i root for the staff yall dont know how to act in a classy establishment the manager has on a visor show some respect i love mcdonalds the other day im at mcdonalds and i order myself a nugget thats my shit now heres where the story gets crazy because the woman behind the register she winked at me she winked at me and then she gave me nuggets whoo come on some of yall get it some of yall know exactly what happened for those of you that dont dont worry ill explain eleven nuggets is a mistake right thats a miscal she aint go to college thats a miscalculation thats a miscalculation of the nugget eleven nuggets is a mistake but nuggets shes trying to fuck right shes trying to have sex with me for nugget the box doesnt even close all the way with nuggets its just sitting wide open ready for me to come inside put some sauce on it you know what sauce im talking about it aint barbecue it aint barbecue and my wife doesnt even like when i go to mcdonalds she gets so upset oh my god mcdonalds that stuff is terrible for you they make their nuggets out of failed pregnancy tests she says wild shit evil shit about mcdonalds and yet here i was standing in front of a woman willing to give me more nuggets than ive ever experienced in my life just a utopia of nuggets in a bag and i swear to god in that moment in that exact moment it took everything in my being not to run away with the mcdonalds lady yeah not to just run away and start a new life bro wed have a beautiful life the mcdonalds lady isnt going to make me read the mcdonalds lady isnt going to make me fold fitted sheets or vote during midterm elections the mcdonalds lady is just going to give me nuggets shell give me nuggets then shell give me nasty mcdonalds sex gimme just that raw its just sex and nuggets and sex and nuggets and sex and nuggets till we both die at happy just keel over and die from nugget poisoning dead and maybe hear me out yall maybe maybe thats what we all should want maybe thats the dream no youre right maybe thats the dream we should all be chasing lets be honest the world is ending it is thats not political slant you dont gotta agree with it it is ice caps are melting bumblebees are dying they added black people to jackass were done this grown black man being like kick me in the dick johnny knoxville ill try it were done but heres a ray of sunshine i offer you before we go home this evening heres a little silver lining the other day i read an article about a woman who kept a box of chicken mcnuggets for six years six years she kept the box shes single six years she aint seeing nobody she got all them nuggets everywhere she kept this box of chicken mcnuggets and on the day of that sixth year the day that six years hit she opened that box she looked inside youve already guessed it those nuggets were exactly as she left them no change whatsoever no mold no crust them little things that be growing on morgan freemans face those old little ngga chocolate chips he got popping up everywhere nothing and i read that article and i thought to myself holy shit most marriages dont make it six years right most of our promises before god end well before these nuggets ever did maybe all of this is a fallacy maybe all these suggestions of eternity and everlasting are bullshit maybe we should just be eating what we want and microwaving cans and jerking off to the green mm do you know what i mean just beating our meat to the green one cause she got eyelashes and we like that i dont care if you take her boots away shes still got them eyelashes let me see them eyelashes you know what i like maybe the only forever we can guarantee is chicken mcnuggets then i thought to myself holy shit i shoulda got my dick sucked by that mcdonalds lady because maybe the preservatives in her mouth wouldve transferred onto my penis and made my nuggets last forever and that above everything else would be the best thing thats ever happened to me and if you didnt like that joke just know that getting my dick sucked is a metaphor for finding true happiness beyond the broken expectations of a dying world if you did like that joke fuck yeah this final selection from sunset singles this final piece i wanna share with you this evening is untitled theres no title for this one but i will say it is by far the most haunting message that i have ever heard or received in my time on this planet earth truly bonechilling shit thats all you need to know well play it for you now oh youre our its good to be here and im just here searching for that special one if i dont write you i dont like you if i write you then i like you lets watch it grow slowly slow but steady hit me up if you think you like me lets get familiar so now yall gotta go home with whatever that is thank you chicago this was dope thank yall for being here aw you thank you  oh shes joining the circus as a parttime clown   travelling from town to town to make her grandpa proud

months ago ive been doing standup comedy for years yeah thank you thank you thank you my agent said to me anthony years is a major accomplishment for any comedian you gotta celebrate pick some of your favorite cities go perform for them and i said no thank you id rather go to milwaukee but look i am excited to be here tonight ive got great news after years of standup comedy just last weekend i finally perfected my act dont get me wrong i thought it was perfect before ran into an audience member after my show last saturday who told me different last saturday night im doing a show in new york after my set im trying to get out to the car a woman from the audience chases me down practically tackles me she says anthony that last joke you told tonight your closer ive gotta tell you that joke is problematic you need to think about it and you need to change it so i changed it and now its my opener so what im gonna do is im gonna tell you that joke explain what happened with that woman and then nail home the point that im the best now as a comedian ive got a responsibility a responsibility that i take very seriously the responsibility to get up in front of a group of strangers and give you my opinion on the trans community yeah thats right look guys youve got to do it now its in the handbook now i feel i feel like the trans community are the new pregnant women just in that it is never polite to guess guys youve got to trust me on this you never you never want to be like hey how far along are you are you going to keep it or no no dont do that even if youre right its rude do what i do im smooth with it i dont ask the question if i want to find something out i just offer you a drink here have this glass of bourbon and if they say actually anthony im seven months pregnant then i get to be like oh my god you look amazing but if they take the drink theyre trans now obviously obviously thats a closer i could leave right now itd be fine but this woman grabs me starts arguing with me she says anthony ive gotta ask you what is your intention with that trans joke i said well my intention is to make trans people laugh i mean could you imagine that would be historic and she says well anthony anthony youre probably not even aware of this but the problem with your joke is some trans people are insecure about the fact that they cant have kids of their own and your joke makes it sound like youre saying the opposite of a pregnant woman is a trans woman and that could be hurtful and i agree that could be hurtful but not coming from me you see i love trans people i empathize with the trans community im not trans myself but i too am always getting yelled at for walking into the wrong bathroom i love trans people you know what i hate pregnant women i mean fuck those chubby bitches am i right they shouldnt be allowed to play sports now look look i will admit i will admit that was a learning moment for me before that woman grabbed me i didnt know that trans

you to enjoy last week i saw a pregnant woman get hit by a bus or as i like to call it a gender reveal party what are you guys laughin at thats not for you thats just for my trans friends dont like pregnant women dont like kids one of my friends just asked me if i would be the sperm donor for her baby i said i dont know thats a pretty big decision how old is your baby if youre walkin in late i

surprises me is these people will text me pictures of their kids anthony will want to see this send i never want to see that the only time a kid shows up on my phone and im happy about it amber alert otherwise otherwise do not get my hopes up i used to ignore those texts from my friends pretend i didnt see em never respond then my sister had a kid started getting mad at me shed be like really

write back the exact same response thanks gonna save this one for later yup no that works you guys can use that it works i havent heard from my sister in a year its the best mmhmm like a lot of people i spent most of the pandemic stuck inside starin at the walls goin crazy i started buyin weird shit online decided i was gonna redecorate my place i dont know anything about interior design but i know what i like so i went on ebay and i paid for a childs coffin i thought thisll be great its vintage you put that in your living room its a conversation starter you know but like so many of the things we bought online during the pandemic i regret it now thing finally showed up in the mail empty i know i know look guys guys guys i hate kids so goddamn much i cant talk to kids these days the other day my little nephew came up to me he said uncle anthony ive been getting bullied by another kid in school i said dont put up with that break his nose hell leave you alone he said uncle anthony thats toxic masculinity well i wasnt gonna put up with that listen you guys came out here to have a good time on a saturday night i know what you want you want to talk politics lets go let me tell you whats wrong with this country let me tell you what the problem is with the united states of america in this country youve gotta be years old to drive a car right that makes sense but youve gotta be years old to be considered an adult to vote i think thats fucked up i think if youre old enough and mature enough to safely drive a car on the street then i should be allowed to have sex with you right anyway thats the only problem with this country now as of this weekend ive been on tour with this material for months and my favorite thing about touring around the country with these jokes the past months has been telling that last joke in the south guys i have learned so much about this great country of ours right at the beginning of this tour months ago i was doing a show in alabama told them that joke guy in the audience stands up and says anthony i hate to break it to you but the age of consent in alabama is so you gotta change that i said oh yeah you got to change that and then a couple of weeks later i did a show in mississippi told them that joke then told them about alabama guy in the audience stands up and says in mississippi the age of consent is and i said holy shit thats perfect i mean that is what the founding fathers were all about you know i have a friend who works for the fbi he pretends to be a girl goes on the internet and chats with child molesters all day i dont know what he does for the fbi but its gotta be i feel like the big new thing i keep hearing more and more about these days is porn addiction i feel like every time i turn around someone is complaining about their porn addiction not me i can handle my shit but a couple of months ago im at a family reunion big jeselnik family reunion everyone is there and the very first night were all in this giant ballroom eating dinner together as a family when my cousin stands up hes years old he says i have an announcement to make i just want to tell you all that ive been suffering from a porn addiction and its terrible but im doing my best to get over it no one in my family knows what to say generations of jeselniks are just staring straight ahead trying to eat their dinner so i stood up i said hey man we can watch something else look i can put the game on if you want but whens the next time were all gonna be together you know i dont have a porn addiction i watch a healthy amount of porn ive got my favorites hell i was in a bar the other night saw my favorite porn star of all time sitting at the end of the bar by herself i couldnt believe it i called the bartender over man ill have another beer and see that girl down there she shouldnt be here shes now this is where audiences traditionally start to complain theyll say anthony why do you have so many jokes about abusing children and why do you do them all in the beginning and this is where i kind of have to stop the show for a minute and i explain to the audience the concept of gallows humor gallows humor is what im all about gallows humor is when you see something in the world that is so horrible that you have to laugh at it otherwise it would destroy you a couple of months ago im reading the newspaper and i come across an article about a priest in my hometown who just got arrested for molesting an altar boy at the exact same church where i was an altar boy growing up that was horrifying to read that couldve been me if i had become a priest we like to have fun im proud to say that ive never once in my entire life paid money to have sex with a prostitute and ill tell you this they get so mad you know theres one thing i like about milwaukee and there is one thing i like about milwaukee seems like a safe place to live yeah maybe not to you but compared to where i live in los angeles oh my god this is paradise my neighborhoods really gone to shit in the past couple years gotten dangerous the other day a woman in my neighborhood was walking her dog had the dog stolen from her at gunpoint now its my dog i actually do love it here in milwaukee i enjoy any time i get to come and perform one of the alltime great standup comedy towns milwaukee yeah it cheers me up to be back in milwaukee ill tell you that ive needed cheering up lately too ive been a little down lately ill admit it lost a friend recently stupid friend of mine went to the hospital for an elective surgery a simple breast reduction surgery did not survive the surgery died right there on the operating table as far as im concerned yeah somehow thats become one of the most polarizing jokes im gonna tell all night and if you didnt laugh at it thats okay but what the fuck do you know ive been doing this for years and ill be honest i had no idea it had been years before my agent told me i never thought of years as a goal i should be trying to achieve ive never defined success by longevity ive always defined success by how long has it been since i had to have a roommate yeah its true i havent had a roommate in years im thats not a flex last roommate i ever had last roommate i ever had he had a video of every single person hed ever had sex with in our apartment yeah its a betrayal of trust but it was hilarious he had no idea another way i define success as an artist how long has it been since i had to have a day job again years i hated the day jobs i had to have coming up imagine what i was like at a day job years ago i had this one day job someone kept stealing my lunch someone stole my lunch every single day even though i clearly had my name written on it and i was pretty sure i knew who did it i just couldnt prove it so one day before work i crushed up an entire bottle of laxatives enough laxatives to cripple a man and i put them in my food and then i waited until this guy got up to go to the bathroom and as soon as he did i shit all over his desk yeah i got fired from most of my day jobs all of them really all of them except the last one last day job i ever had i worked in a giant soulless corporate office building and i quit in the middle of the day after i watched a woman accidentally step into an empty elevator shaft and plummet stories to her death i just walked right the fuck out and that was my last day in elevator repair if theres one thing im getting sick of after years of standup comedy its the travel i always say i do the shows for free you pay me to travel and that is certainly true tonight two nights ago i fly from new york city to milwaukee twoandahalfhour flight its direct it should be easy i get on the plane the woman sitting next to me has a dog curled up in her lap and i say excuse me but what the fuck is this this woman i swear to god she rolls her eyes at me and she goes uh this is my emotional support animal i have a note from my doctor i was like note from your doctor do you really need an emotional support animal on this flight and she goes no and i thought my head was going to explode i dont like when people take advantage of the system like that its a twoandahalfhour flight i talked to her about it im happy to report by the time we landed she needed that fucking dog air travel has gotten so uncomfortable in the past few years but everyone i know who flies a lot like i do they always have a little trick everyones got their own unique trick to make flying easier for them like im friends with a very wealthy married couple theyre millionaires and they got six kids in between the two of em theyre always flying off on some exotic family vacation and whenever they fly their trick is the family flies on two separate airplanes that way worstcase scenario one of those planes crashes they dont have to deal with their kids anymore uhhuh but look if im being honest with you guys if im being honest i dont actually have any married friends i used to used to have a lot of married friends but all my married friends have gotten divorced in the past two years all of them but ive noticed something all my friends divorces they all had two things in common infidelity and me hey listen all right listen you guys have been great so far i hate to do this to you but this next joke is gonna be too smart for the crowd dont worry i will explain it to you and after all arent those the best jokes sigmund freuds mom mustve been so fucking hot okay get that a lot of you were faking it for the cameras let me explain dr sigmund freud the most famous psychoanalyst of all time his main theory his main claim to fame was the theory that every young man wanted to murder his own father and have sex with his own mother imagine imagine how hot his mom must have been for his colleagues to go publish that i was years old when i walked in on my parents having sex thats a big moment for any young man that moment when you realize your parents are more than just mom and dad theyre also swingers yeah that was a core memory for sure never forget that ill never forget the night of my senior prom night of my senior prom im years old im at home putting on my tuxedo when my dad walked in the room and he handed me a condom snuck it to me in a handshake so fuckin gross then he looks me right in the eyes and he says anthony do you have any questions i said yeah dad do you have one thats still in the wrapper yeah my dad was fuckin weird okay all your dads are weird when youre a kid you cant recognize how weird your parents are its not until you get older that you figure it out like when i was a little kid every year on my birthday my dad would take me into the kitchen put me up against the kitchen wall and make a little mark to measure my girth mm and maybe that messed me up a little bit i dont know i feel like im a pretty normal guy although i do get angry when people try to talk to me about sex i was having lunch with a friend the other day and he says anthony ive been havin trouble with premature ejaculation i said oh yeah why dont you try talkin about baseball he said anthony dont you mean thinking about baseball and i said i dont give a fuck what you think about just dont talk to me about your premature ejaculation when i was growin up i had a sibling rivalry with my little brother got out of hand to be quite honest one day my little brother went into the backyard took my dogs collar off and let it run away from home so i poisoned his fish i think i won that one cause the next day i went out and i found my dog put his collar back on brought him back home but my brother he died from the salmon yeah its a banger last year my parents lost all of their money in a ponzi scheme so of course they came to me their wealthy successful son and asked me why i did that mm mm yeah my family didnt have a lot of money when i was growin up my dad was a volunteer firefighter do you know what a volunteer firefighter is it is exactly like a regular firefighter except your son does not respect you my moms been having a hard time shes gettin paranoid in her old age cant sleep at night cause she gets too scared so every night around bedtime she calls me to complain on the phone for hours that shes too afraid to fall asleep in her own home so finally after months of this just to get her off my back i bought her a gun and now shes scared about that she said anthony whats the matter with you dont you know that people who live with a gun are more than twice as likely to be shot in their own home i said mom i am counting on it and look maybe maybe im being too harsh i have trouble sleeping sometimes too like the other night the other night im lying in bed and i cannot fall asleep im just staring out my bedroom window for hours and i swear i saw my nextdoor neighbor murder his wife in their kitchen then dispose of the body in garbage bags now im worried im next like i dont think he saw me but he sure as shit heard me clappin now heres a joke i like a lot my cousin randy is maybe the dumbest person ive ever met in my entire life dumbest guy ive ever met the other day he comes up and he goes anthony check out my new tattoo its the japanese symbol for awesome no randy thats a swastika i mean fuck man everybody knows everybody knows thats the german symbol for awesome now i said i liked that joke a lot heres how much i like that joke i used to open with it right at the beginning of this tour months ago kanye west came to one of my shows i had no idea he was even there i didnt find out until the next day when kanye went on a podcast and he said i went to go see anthony jeselnik last night and his opening joke is so high level that it made me realize im not funny guys that blew my mind thats the best compliment ive ever gotten in my life i humbled kanye west you know yeah im not gonna lie i was so excited i watched that clip times i sent it to my manager i said put this on my website put it on social media lets sell some fucking tickets with a little help from kanye and my manager says to me anthony are you out of your goddamn mind dont you know whats been going on with kanye lately and i said no honestly i used to be a huge kanye fan but i stopped paying attention to him when he went christian and my manager says well in the past two weeks alone kanyes been wearing white lives matter tshirts and saying wild antisemitic shit and i was like oh he went super christian that crazy son of a bitch finally finished the whole book my manager said look anthony you can use this clip of kanye to promote yourself if you want to but if you do you gotta drop that swastika joke you gotta stop doing it for sure otherwise youre gonna start to attract the wrong kinds of fans and your current fans will take the wrong lesson from what youre doing and thats how much i like that joke im against cancel culture thank you thats my impression of a shit comic trying to get on rogan in years of standup comedy ive been asked the same questions over and over and over again the question i get asked the most by far is anthony what do you think about cancel culture does it make you mad arent you scared what do you think about cancel culture so let me be clear i dont give a fuck about cancel culture what i am sick of are comedians complaining about cancel culture its not that hard do your job comedians are supposed to be unparalleled badasses i know this because i have a fucking mirror cancel culture is not scary its also not interesting and its definitely not new back when i was in college i had this crazy professor made all of his students fill out their own suicide note then he would read them out loud to the rest of the class as soon as the parents found out he got fired immediately and i was the only one who stood up for him because hey he made math fun and yes i did mention joe rogan guys do not get me wrong i like joe joes my friend joes a good guy but if you listen to his podcast youre a fucking loser my brotherinlaw is joe rogans biggest fan never misses an episode doesnt think four hours is long enough but my brotherinlaw is joe rogans target demographic my brotherinlaw is a conspiracy theorist a crazy conspiracy theorist like my brotherinlaw refuses to become an organ donor because he swears that if you get into an accident and the paramedics see that youre an organ donor they wont try to save your life cause they want to use your organs to help someone else its insane but i cant argue with him hes a paramedic another question ive been asked a million times in the last years anthony whats your favorite joke youve ever written its easy the first one twenty years ago when i started this i started from nothing i was nothing i was just going around to open mics in los angeles performing for bitter openmic comedians who never reacted to anything i was just trying to find my voice could i be good at this could i make it a living and it took a while until one night i went to a coffee shop tried this joke out for the first time changed my whole life i said guys my girlfriend loves to eat chocolate shes always eating chocolate and she likes to joke shes got a chocolate addiction hmm keep me away from those chocolate bars im addicted to em and its really annoying so one day i put her in the car and i drove her downtown and i pointed out a crack addict and i said do you see that honey why cant you be that skinny and i will never forget telling that joke for the very first time to a room full of bitter openmic comedians who never reacted to anything and the whole room just went ooh i was like oh im gonna be a fucking star and then of course a couple years later i got my big break and i got to do some roasting got to roast donald trump charlie sheen roseanne barr all the greats people still ask me anthony which one was your favorite charlie sheen but not because of charlie sheen i didnt give a fuck about charlie sheen i remember a couple days before that roast im at home writing jokes and i get a phone call from the network and they say anthony i know you only have a couple days left to write but we just added mike tyson to the dais will you be able to write yourself any jokes about mike tyson two days later i am walking into that roast with jokes about mike tyson i am so excited and right as i go to sit down guy from the network comes back he goes im just doublechecking with you you dont have any mike tyson rape jokes do you and i said why and he said well it was almost impossible to get mike tyson to agree to appear on a televised roast we had to promise him there would be no rape jokes i was like are we talking about the same mike tyson so now the roast has begun im up at the podium cameras are rolling i have zero jokes about mike tyson and i am mad about it but out of the corner of my eye i can see mike tyson sitting on the stage mikes been drinkin mikes been smokin mikes laughing at everything mikes responding to jokes that arent even about him mike tyson was having the time of his life so i think you know what i can do one so i said i think mike tysons biggest problem is mike never had a strong male role model growing up mikes dad walked out on the family very early on after mike raped him now as soon as i tell this joke as soon as i tell this joke i regret it i am afraid and i turned to look at mike tyson to see is he coming at me am i about to die and i just see mike tyson throw his head back and he goes he got you charlie guys in years of standup comedy ive gotten to meet so many famous people havent given a fuck about any of em except for one and that was norm macdonald yeah yeah all right long before i ever even considered becoming a comedian i worshiped norm macdonald he was my hero when i was a kid hes still my hero today never got to meet him for the longest time then a couple years ago i get a phone call from my agent he says anthony how would you like to be the new host of last comic standing and i said why the fuck would i want to do that that show sucks and he said this year its gonna be different this year they have norm macdonald as a judge would you like to work with norm and i signed up on the spot norm and i made eight episodes of this tv show together eight straight nights of eighthour tapings every night and for the first four episodes norm macdonald and i do not get along at all we get into fights every night on the air we get into fights every night backstage we flatout do not like each other and its killing me hes my hero and the only reason i took this job so for those first four episodes i am working at it and im working at it hard norms working at it too just not nearly as hard but after four episodes for whatever reason something clicks finally norm and i are laughing together were getting along all i ever wanted after the show was finally finished norm and i had to go and promote it and the last time i ever saw norm macdonald we are backstage at larry king im getting interviewed first and then norm right before i go out norm says to me hey anthony i know we havent always gotten along or seen eyetoeye but if youre up for it and you trust me i thought of something really funny that you and i could do together i said oh my god norm of course youre my hero tell me what you want to do he says i think itll be funny if instead of promoting the show by talking about these other comedians why dont you and i just promote the show by publicly insulting each other he says dont even try to be funny anthony just be mean and i said you know what norm i can do that i sit down with larry king larry says anthony what you think about norm macdonald and i said larry norm macdonald is a piece of shit and i can hear norm laughing backstage i finish the interview i go backstage norm is still laughin he says anthony that was perfect now watch this norm sits down with larry king larry king says norm what do you think about anthony jeselnik norm says larry hes one of the greats ive never been more pissed off in my entire life cant believe i fell for that you have been an amazing crowd today im going to leave you all with this this is my new closer dont worry it is transproof about a month ago i went to a wedding craziest wedding ive ever seen after the ceremony every single person there took molly the bride took molly the groom took molly the parents the grandparents every single person there was on molly craziest shit ive ever seen i blacked out around midnight woke up the next morning in a fucking hammock somewhere went and found the bride and groom and i was like hey guys did i do anything embarrassing last night and they said yeah anthony you spiked the punch with molly thank you very much milwaukee have a great night thank you\",\n          \"ellen degeneres for your approval is less a comedy special and more an hourlong ego massage for the embattled host what should have been a triumphant farewell instead feels like a poorly executed pr stunt filled with tired drawnout jokes and forced selfdeprecation ellen spends much of the special rehashing controversies surrounding her toxic workplace allegations but instead of addressing them meaningfully she spins these moments into awkward jokes coming across as defensive rather than introspective the comedy itself is uninspired and stale with tired observations about things like car troubles pigeons and aging that feel recycled from better comics the pacing is atrocious dragging on for what feels like an eternity with ellen stretching out weak material well beyond its comedic lifespan her attempts to balance humor with personal reflection fall flat making it seem more like shes fishing for sympathy rather than offering genuine entertainment whats most striking is the clear disconnect between ellen and her audience the packed crowd of adoring fans seems willing to laugh at anything she says but the comedy is hollow with ellen relying on her celebrity status rather than delivering anything truly funny or meaningful its painfully obvious that this special exists not because she has anything new to say but because she needs to reclaim some positive attention after her tarnished reputation for your approval is a disappointing selfserving finale that highlights how out of touch ellen has become for anyone hoping for a strong farewell from a comedy icon this special is a huge letdown if this is ellens swan song its a sour note to go out on if you have never seen ellen do standup live you are in for a treat tonight two minutes her first appearance on network television would you welcome ellen degeneres wouldnt it be great if we could pick up the phone and call up god and ask yeah hi god this is ellen ellen degeneres degeneres wwhats so funny i never thought of that it does sound like that doesnt it my grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was shes today we dont know where the hell she is ellen is on the fast track shes one of the top female comedians on television ellens new sitcom is a certifiable topten hit the real ellen is putting all that success and fame at risk susan im gay more than million people watched her comingout episode why did you think it was necessary for you to come out because its okay ellen finds herself at the center of a storm of controversy being accused of going too far too gay when life gets you down you know what you gotta do  just keep swimming swimming swimming  she may have pulled off one of the greatest comebacks of all time the ellen show has become one of the most popular shows in the world praised for delivering a daily dose of joy with its unique mix of dancing games talk and millions of dollars in audience giveaways spreading laughter seems to be working well for the entertainer and comedian and shes showing no signs of slowing down a few years ago i started ending my show by saying be kind to one another heres the downside um i can never do anything unkind ever now ever breaking news tonight is the queen of nice  really the queen of mean respond to this with the most insane stories about ellen being mean shes not the happygolucky nice person ellen degeneres is under fire again with accusations of a toxic work environment toxic phony hypocrite liar things are spiraling ellen degeneres degeneres degeneres its a breaking story in the world of entertainment and this is great great news ellen is back although shes saying this new special will be her farewell thank you thank you thank you thank you so much it seems like you still care you know i used to say that i didnt care what other people thought of me i realize now looking back i said that at the height of my popularity if i look older than when you saw me last its because im older than when you saw me last and also i stopped doing botox and filler yeah i used to do botox back when i didnt care what other people thought of me thats when i did it such a waste of time to worry about what people think of us just a waste of energy were just guessing we dont know its impossible to know what people are thinking i walk out here tonight and im hoping that youre thinking this is marvelous im so happy to be here that is my hope but well good but some of you could be thinking lets see how this goes some of you may be thinking why is she doing this does she owe back taxes im here because i love doing standup i miss doing standup and i like making people happy and i do care what people think we all care what people think we can say we dont we can pretend we dont care all it takes is trying to parallel park in front of a crowded outdoor caf\\u00e9 spot looks big enough you line it up the way you always do you pull in cut it a little too close youre scraping the hubcap the entire way along the curb making a very loud noise put it in drive pull out try it again now youve overcompensated youre sticking so far out youre blocking traffic in that lane now you have a decision to make do you have the confidence to pull out and do it right this time or do you do that backandforth backandforth backandforth inching your way to the curb knowing how long thats gonna take and people are watching the deep shame you feel when you give up and drive away even if youre meeting someone you say im so sorry i couldnt make it and theyre like you did i was sitting there i was watching you i started the chant its funny how we can be embarrassed all by ourselves in a car all by ourselves for anything just any stupid reason like even if we just cant figure out how to turn our windshield wipers off which to me is one of the most embarrassing things is driving a car when its not raining and the windshield wipers are going and its because someone decided to add a random one we had the windshield wiper situation was fine we had the fast mode for when its raining heavily medium light and then someone decided were just gonna wash away the rain once in a while we dont need to see all the time and its always a surprise cause you think the rain has stopped youve turned it off and youre driving along and five minutes later you see this thing like then youre trying to fiddle with it trying to turn it off and you dont know how cause its always different sometimes its on the end of the lever on the steering wheel sometimes theres a lever within the lever the baby lever like the lever had a baby and its inside the lever right there tiny baby lever you dont trust it cause youre just waiting even if its not going youre like its gonna go again i know it i feel it and then finally it does and then you feel pretty confident about it then you catch the rearview mirror your back ones been on the whole time yeah thats what you did you turned that one on you turn that off turn everything back on again you have to sell your car theres so many extraneous things in a car we dont need for instance i have never used my parking brake ive never parked my car and thought i want it more parked than this there are things you need the seat adjustments scoot forward lean back you need those then theres that one button that inflates the back of the seat the one that makes you feel like youre getting spooned by a pregnant woman oh boy ooh all right apparently its for lumbar support got to support your lumbar you got to its all any of us knows about the lumbar its got to be supported you dont get support for your lumbar any place other than your car you dont even hear about the lumbar anyplace else bill whats wrong whats happening its my damn lumbar i havent been driving enough lately mm thats how you walk when your lumbar is out there are buttons in my car ive never used never will use theres a button with squiggly lines next to a misshapen peanut i dont know ive never touched it im fine theres a button with tally marks next to a sideways yarmulke what the hell dont get me started on the dashboard lights too the dashboard lights are not illuminated all the time so when they are it must mean something serious right but check engine thats vague ive checked it its there i shouldnt have to guess from an exclamation point between two parentheses that my tire pressure is low but if my windshield wiper fluid is low all the words windshield wiper fluid low oh my god pull over just cause i dont know my buttons doesnt mean im stupid just means im not interested were all interested in different things all good at different things i was talking to someone and they said i dont know how you get on stage i could never do that i said well i dont know how you dryclean clothes clean clothes dryly and then you martinize on top of that some of you are in your twenties you dont know what martinizing is no its not my job to explain it to you also i dont know and i never have yeah none of us do let me catch you up on whats been going on with me since you saw me last i got chickens yeah thank you i love them so very much chickens are the best bird to have at home i think so a lot of people think parrots but theyre so gossipy you have to be really careful what you say around them chickens will never talk they have little personalities ive always wanted chickens now i have them theyre so cute they see me they recognize me when i walk towards them and they run to me i put a swing in there for them and they get on a swing chicken on a swing thats ridiculous i have a bench in there and i go sit there and they sit on my lap and i pet them and they fall asleep and they give me an egg every day they lay an egg every day as someone who hosted a daily talk show i can really appreciate that yeah yeah im sure theyre thinking i just laid an egg i dont think i can do that again tomorrow and yet they do theyre curious little animals too theyre very curious hey you know how people always ask why did the chicken cross the road i think i know now that i have chickens its their innate sense of adventure im sorry to be just another comedian going on and on about her chickens another thing about chickens is that um they they fly people think theyre flightless birds and that is not true they do fly the longest recorded chicken flight is seconds isnt that amazing someone thought to time that yeah also chickens dream scientists have discovered that chickens dream now listen i love animals more than anyone but we could take scientists working on chicken dreams and move them on over to climate change im not saying that chicken dreaming is not worth studying it is but we dont need our top minds on it i dont think i am curious what do they dream about probably the same things we do probably flying but or seconds for them you know mm thats all for chickens yeah got to save some for the memoir yeah yeah yeah yeah let me see what else i can tell you about that has been going on chickens oh yeah i got kicked out of show business yeah yeah thanks yeah cause im mean yeah you cant be mean and be in show business no theyll kick you out no mean people in show business im out yeah yall heard i was mean everybody heard that i was mean everywhere i go i know everyones heard that im mean i know when i walk into a restaurant people are watching waiting to see if ill be mean do you think shell be mean first and then dance look she oh shes reaching for butter i thought she was gonna hit somebody all right im gonna eat you watch now that was a big story huh that had some legs on it the first i heard about it i i came across a headline that said how ellen degeneres became the most hated person in america now i didnt see the other names on the ballot but i have to yeah its its an impressive title it really is its a its a horrible thing to say about somebody and to make it worse there was no trophy no awards banquet nothing just the title just you know i made a sash at home and i wore that around just to to feel like i had something you know it was quite a shock to me because for years there were all these polls basically saying i was one of the most trusted people in the country there was a poll that asked people which celebrity would you most want to babysit your child and i was the number one answer because when you think good with kids you immediately think childless lesbian standup comedian once they heard that i might be mean they didnt want me to babysit anymore so it wasnt all bad no i was in therapy for a while trying to deal with all the hatred coming at me and it was not a common situation for a therapist to deal with my therapist said ellen where do you get this idea that everyone hates you and i said well um new york times washington post entertainment weekly us weekly i think elmo may have said something recently on an episode of sesame street she said you just need to avoid looking at the news just avoid media and i was like i am im not looking at anything i would know when something was going on because id start getting text from friends saying thinking of you or sending love and id be like oh why do i need love sent the be kind girl wasnt kind that was the headline heres the problem im a comedian who got a talk show and i ended the show every day by saying be kind to one another yeah i know it seemed like a good idea but i became a brand a onedimensional character who gave stuff away and danced every day up steps do you know how hard it was to dance up steps would a mean person dance up steps i dont think so had i ended my show by saying go fuck yourselves people would have been pleasantly surprised to find out im kind i loved that show i loved everything about that show it was a family to me heres something sweet sixteen people who worked there started out straight and by the time they left were gay yeah you dont see jimmy kimmel doing those kind of numbers you know whats funny is that when i first came out people were afraid that watching my show would turn people gay which is ridiculous you have to work there you have to fill out a and then you turn gay we had so much fun together at that show we laughed all the time we played games all the time i started a game of tag in like that we played all the way till when the show ended cause i just loved playing games we played tag and i would chase people down the hallways i would chase them around the studio and scare them all the time i would jump out scare people cause i would love to do that and hearing myself say this out loud i realize i was chasing my employees and terrorizing them i can see where that would be misinterpreted well we had morning meetings every morning in my office the producers would come in writers would come in and wed talk about what we were gonna do on the show that day and andy lassner was one of my executive producers yeah uh andy is a very nervous man and he everything scares him he could drop his pen and it would startle him hes just a nervous man and alison was one of my writers who was scared of snakes anything snakerelated so sometimes before theyd come into my office we would hide rubber snakes in a panel in the ceiling and i had a button that i could push that would release the snakes down again hearing myself say this out loud but they liked it they did there are a lot of perks with having your own television show number one has to be the ability to say to someone we should have a panel in the ceiling that releases snakes and then another adult says yeah well get that started right away scaring was just a big component of the show we would you know we started with scaring guests and i dont remember exactly how it started it was some simple like i think chris hemsworth or some big strong guy that was on the show we found out was scared of crickets so we had someone dress as a cricket and sneak up behind his chair when he was talking and you know make a cricket noise and scare him and then it just escalated we just decided to make it more surprising to people and eventually we uh built a table that looked like the table between me and the guest but it was actually a box where someone could pop out and scare them but the guests got wise to that and if they saw that it was a box they would open it and look in the box so we built a tunnel under the stage that went into the box so that when they checked it it was empty and then theyd close it and somebody would crawl into the box from underneath i was a very immature boss i didnt want to be a boss i didnt go to business school i went to charlies chuckle hut it looked like i was the boss the show is called ellen and everybodys wearing tshirts that say ellen and there were buildings all over the warner bros lot that said ellen but i dont think that meant that i should be in charge i dont think that ronald mcdonalds the ceo of mcdonalds everything i knew about being a boss i learned from movies and those were things like saying jenkins my office now or the names frank how the hell are you but those were men bosses women bosses didnt come along for a while not till around the time of martinizing i think no but men bosses and women bosses are different like a woman boss couldnt say jenkins my office now a woman boss would have to use more words a woman boss would have to say something like excuse me jenkins i dont want to bother you if youre not too busy could you step into my office real quick i just have to talk to you for a second thank you so much cause women are raised in a different way at least i was i was raised to be a people pleaser i was taught when i was a little girl to be small and quiet and agreeable and its crazy what ive done with my life cause im exactly the opposite of how i was raised to be yeah most women arent raised with confidence we just arent were too selfconscious which is why you rarely see a woman playing air guitar i love how they make it like its hard like somethings happening there men can get away with acting out things that arent actually happening and not look crazy somehow a man in the middle of nowhere and for no reason can practice an imaginary golf swing just oh no im not in line im just waiting for my latte you go ahead menll jump up and see if they can slap the top of a doorframe ive never had that urge i wonder if i could hit that tiffany hold my purse im gonna give it a try i couldnt do it i didnt give me my purse i didnt do it good we have all these unwritten rules based on gender of acceptable behavior of who were allowed to be and how were allowed to act if we dont follow those rules it makes people uncomfortable when people get uncomfortable there are consequences for those of you keeping score this is the second time ive been kicked out of show business yeah kicked me out before cause i told them i was gay no gay people in show business no theyll kick you out cant be gay and be in show business eventually theyre gonna kick me out a third time for being old mean old and gay the triple crown i knew it was a risk to tell people i was gay cause i knew a lot of people didnt like gay people if they did we wouldnt have needed the parade listen we dont like all of you either but we dont make a big thing about it most of us get into this business because we didnt get enough love or attention as a child so we go into a business that depends on people liking us to be successful whats wrong with us for me it was never about the money it was about healing my childhood wounds i thought if i could make people happy then theyll like me and if they like me ill feel good about myself and all i can say about that is thank god for the money cause its a fickle business they liked me for a long time i was on a sitcom i made them laugh they liked me then i told them i was gay and they didnt like me then i got a talk show and i gave them tvs and cars and i danced and they liked me then they heard a rumor i was mean they didnt like me so its been a real test for my ego and my selfesteem because theres such extremes in this business there are people who love you and idolize you and then there are people who hate you just really loudly hate you so sometimes i long for my childhood when i just had good oldfashioned neglect what was wrong with that its been two years since the show ended and its been an adjustment because for years i drove onto the warner bros lot passed a giant billboard of my face so the first thing i did was i had a giant billboard of my face installed on my lawn so i saw that when i drove in yeah then i put an applause sign in the dining room and thats helping also but really ive only known myself working for years thats all ive done is work so i didnt really have a lot of free time and didnt have hobbies now theres a lot of free time so im trying to figure out what to do with that so i got the chickens remember i dont know if you yeah i decided to take up gardening cause everybody talks about gardening and how great gardening is its not no its really not i got the overalls and the tool belt and the hat i looked adorable i did but i find once you put the plants in the ground youre no longer gardening youre just waiting you know i tell people i grew these strawberries but at best i was just there when it happened its the sun and the sprinklers that should take the credit im more like the strawberries godmother showing up on its birthday look how big youre getting see you at christmas maybe it is relaxing to be out there though mainly cause the garden gloves make it impossible for me to look at my phone yeah sometimes ill put the garden gloves on and go inside and lay down yeah its just as relaxing really my garden gloves and my sweatpants i live in sw when im at home i just wear sweatpants i dont understand people who dont just wear sweatpants at home like whats the point you know yeah i take off my goingout clothes i take those off put on my stayinghome clothes once im in my sweatpants im not leaving not leaving the house a few weeks ago a friend of mine texted me and he said would you like to come over for a lastminute dinner party for mick as in jagger now ive never met mick jagger and i would love to meet mick jagger but i was in my sweatpants already and i was not leaving thats what i told him and he could not believe that was the reason i wasnt going i guess most people would make something up because it is a ridiculous reason and i know that but it was the truth you know and you know people say honesty is the best policy i dont know why they say that its only the best policy if its something you want to hear really like there are certain degrees of honesty if you tell someone theres something stuck in their teeth they dont love that but they kind of appreciate that and theyll take that but as soon as you tell someone that all of their stories should be shorter yeah you lose of their friendship is what happens people say its hard to tell the truth for me its hard not to tell the truth which is why it was really difficult for me to keep my sexuality a secret because i felt such guilt for not being honest about who i was i felt shame for how society was making me feel i felt fear for what would happen to my career if i did come out ultimately i decided its more important for me to be honest about who i am yeah yeah they say the truth will set you free and it did i was free for three years nobody would hire me truth will make you broke people lie so much these days they really do you can tell because they make such a big deal of it when theyre telling the truth theyll say things like well to tell you the truth or if im being honest if youre being honest i prefer it the other way around listen im gonna lie to you here that lasagna was phenomenal most people tell me that they appreciate my honesty because they know where they stand with me but someone did suggest that i get tested to see if im on the spectrum and uh im not on the spectrum and i wouldnt care if i was on the spectrum but im not well i am on the spectrum we all are its a spectrum im on the part of the spectrum where someone on the spectrum would have a problem with me saying im on the spectrum so yeah thats right but i may have ocd because a therapist said so and i said yes i am very organized because i thought that was the o i didnt know what ocd was i was raised in a religion christian science that doesnt acknowledge diseases or disorders so when i was growing up nobody talked about anything there was no discussion of anything i look back now and i realize my dad for sure had ocd he would check the doorknob times before we would leave he would check the faucet times he would unplug all the appliances before we left the house because lightning could strike and it would catch fire they say it could be hereditary so i went home and i asked portia i said do you think i may have ocd and she said yes you do barely got that sentence out really its funny ive never thought of myself as obsessive i think of myself as careful and everyone else careless and out of control i asked her what i obsess about and she said you obsess about time and that is true i dont like to be late i like to be on time so sometimes that makes us early this is the example she said i should share with you i um there are many but this is the one she said usher was having an afterparty for the grammys one year and we got there so early it was just us and the staff yup yup we helped place candles on tables i invoiced him these are my confessions i just dont know why the invitation says a certain time for a party to start and then everyone goes an hour or two later people seem to think that means means means means nothing to me cause im not going who starts something at anyway i obsess on time and uh i obsess on animals i know i obsess on animals cause i love them too much like way too much i think about how they see things and what they feel and what they think and i worry about butterflies in rainstorms and how delicate they are and how their little tiny feet are holding on to a blade of grass trying to winds blowing the rain is happening on their little tiny wings saturating their wings and their feet holding especially if its a butterfly what if its his first day and theyre like is this life this is horrible ooh i should have stayed a caterpillar the monarch butterfly think about that how crazy is that story you know the story i dont have to tell you but i will the little tiny caterpillar i mean how does it even make it past the caterpillar stage its a larva and then that somehow gets into a caterpillar and a caterpillar just and somehow it just knows instinctively its time for that part of its life to change thats done im gonna put myself into a chrysalis and then it turns into liquid somehow and then it becomes a butterfly flying for the first time and it looks drunk and confused the way they you know and they make it to mexico that way i dont know how the butterfly is beautiful and people talk about the butterfly but the butterfly wouldnt be the butterfly without the caterpillar i mean the deep knowing that that caterpillar has its only perspective is crawling on the ground and its looking at other crawling things saying im gonna fly someday and im gonna go to mexico and theyre like no youre not and whats mexico but i dont know if we really fully appreciate what that metamorphosis is the fact that its a caterpillar it knows to change and becomes this other thing entirely thats genius its brilliance and the octopus the octopus being able to change texture and shape and form and color instantaneously depending on what its on thats genius a colony of ants or of bees the way they communicate and theres no chaos between all of those things everything in nature is living up to its full potential but i am so disappointed in pigeons what happened to them i mean pigeons they have builtin gps in their beaks and they can fly for hundreds of miles in world war ii they saved lives they were taking messages from generals to other generals and saving lives there are pictures of them in the newspaper with medals not pinned but around their necks that they received for what they did in world war ii and now look at them just pecking at old gum in filthy alleyways and parking lots they could be anywhere i would feel sorry for them but they made a choice i mean they barely fly anymore they theyre just uh filthy and even if a car is coming they dont even fly to get out of the way all right okay all right okay all right okay okay all right okay sometimes it looks like theyre gonna do something important youll see a bunch and they all get up at once again that kind of communication all of them get up at once they fly and they just go in one big circle and they go right back to where they were god you guys not living up to their potential i rescued a pigeon one time ill rescue anything ive always tried to save animals my whole life but i saw a onelegged pigeon on the street near where i lived and i took it home because i knew it wasnt gonna make it on the street and i didnt know how to take care of it i mean never had a pigeon so i just threw gum and trash down dirt thinking thats what it eats you know because ive never seen it it didnt make it ill rescue anything i really will and if i see a sign of someone posting a cat or a dog missing when they post those pictures i will drive around and i will try to find that animal and its not just for the reward money its not no i rescued a dog one time i was driving and i see this dog all by itself and i get out of the car and its soaking wet im like oh my god what happened to you take it home dry it off stays with me for the night put out posters the next afternoon get a call from the people saying thank god where did you find it and i told them and they said thats where we live yeah they said we had just given it a bath and we put her on the lawn to dry out it was pretty close to the sidewalk when i saw it anyway i obsess on things i have add and i blame the talk show for that because for years i was talking to people in fiveminute segments when im at a party and someones talking to me longer than five minutes i have the urge to say im sorry we have to take a break parties are hard for me parties are very hard for me people are wanting to talk and stuff and they always talk about books theyre reading i dont read i want to i try to read but my add makes it really hard for me as much as i try to focus on the words i end up thinking about a sandwich i had earlier that day moby dick for me is two pages about a whale and pages about me wondering if i should grow my hair out or keep it short ive had it short for a while i should try to grow it out probably maybe to my shoulderlength or something like that not much longer than that i wonder how long that would take though i should probably keep it short i think thats better why not try something different though i should oh yeah oh its done yeah yeah my add makes it really hard for me to sit down and focus on anything at all like do you know how hard it was for me to put this together of course you dont why would i ask that question why do people ask people questions they know they dont have the answer to why do people say guess what i did yesterday do i have to is it a game is there a prize i dont want to youll never guess what i did yesterday youre right i wont i wont probably not unless its something really average like you had lunch you said ill never guess so its probably something weird like you got a chinchilla and named it stewart i dont know so its hard for me to focus and i get like when i was thinking about pigeons and how disappointed i was in them i was i remembered that i had rescued the pigeon cause id forgotten i was like yeah i rescued that onelegged pigeon and when i wrote down legged i did the hyphen thing and i thought legged or legged is it legged onelegged onelegged pigeon or onelegged its not one armmed you dont one armmed armed but its two gs so legged you dont go i begged for food no you dont stay i got mugged its legged or legged oneleg pigeon onelegged onelegged oneleg pigeon onelegged oneleg pigeon onelegged pigeon a oneleg onelegged oneleg pigeon onelegged pigeon so i have add i have ocd im losing my memory but i think im welladjusted because i obsess on things but dont have the attention span to stick with it then i forget what i was obsessing about in the first place so it takes me all the way around to being welladjusted i think yeah im very impatient that is a problem for me im very impatient its hard for me to live in the moment were supposed to live in the moment but every moment eh the spiritual teacher ram dass wrote a book called be here now id like to write one for people with add and call it yeah but whats that over there there are all these books out there telling us how to live telling us why were here cause why are we here really i mean obviously to gossip and make fun of each other on the internet but why else these things i think about now that im older im years old and i thank you thats how you know youre old you get the applause you dont get it when youre or even in your it starts around so i dont like the word old i think its a bad word it just sounds bad old is that bread still good no thats old old and i dont feel old the only time i feel old is when im in a restaurant trying to read a menu that is the only time i feel old yeah you know all the reasons its like too dark in there its always too dark and the way they think theyre gonna help they put a tealight candle on the table which does nothing i blow it out i just blow it out and oh okay youre gonna light it again all right im just gonna because it doesnt do anything thats why why are you lighting okay ill do it again im just gonna put it in my pocket how about that you cant see and if you put your flashlight on your phone to try to read the menu that just automatically says old thats just thats they should come with a sound effect when you put the flashlight on old it should just be old and even if you can see the print is so small i dont know who is printing these menus but the print is so tiny its like theyre using a jewelers loupe to make the font its tiny tiny font you cant read it im like can you see that does that say tortilla or trampoline what does that say to you i cant see anything yeah hi okay ill go ahead and order im gonna get the pasta with stem cells they have a childrens menu they should have a largerprint menu for older people with a bendy light so you can see it or even better they should come out in audiobook a menu could be an audio meryl streep reads the cheesecake factory pancakes i dont do impressions thats pancakes when youre this age the doctors start asking you to come in for checkups even though theres nothing wrong with you they just want to see you its a scam theyre just looking for stuff they ask you all kinds of personal stuff how many drinks per week do you have first of all its none of your business second of all im gonna lie to you here three drinks per week how about i start with per day before i do that math okay carry the two they just look for stuff my doctor said whens the last time you had a bone density test and i said a what bone density test i said ive never had a bone density test well at your age you should get one i said why im in good shape no you should get one at your age so i got the stupid bone density test im off the charts below it i have fullon osteoporosis i dont even know how im standing up right now im like a human sandcastle i could disintegrate in the shower i have to take that prolia shot every six months remember the commercial where the womans walking and a kid darts out on the skateboard or something whoa whoa thats me its hard to be honest about aging and seem cool hey if you got arthritis in your knee make some noise oh me too i just had excruciating pain one day and i thought i tore a ligament or something i got the mri and theyre like no its just arthritis i said howd i get that he goes it just happens at your age all these things just happen at your age its around the time you start watching wheel of fortune yeah theres no buildup you just find yourself sitting there enjoying it one day thats a pretty gown vannas wearing the prizes are tricky on there i find i think they really are i had a conversation about this the other day if you land on the dollar amount the or the you get that right but if you land on the car honk honk half a car by the way youre trying to land on the million dollars thats what you want but the million dollars is sandwiched in between two bankrupts if you freezeframe it youll notice that the bankrupts are a little bit larger than the sliver of the million dollars youll see when you freezeframe it its just when you land on it youre like i got a million dollars but no you dont you have to have so many other things that line up to get that which i was telling myself when portia walked in and said who are you talking to another thing that happens when you age you just start talking to yourself id probably be doing this exact same thing right now if you werent here aging is very interesting aging is tough on its own but aging then you have aging parents which a lot of people are dealing with now which is really really tough my father is no longer with us well he was never with you um my mother has dementia now and um which is a horrible disease and so many people are dealing with it right now my mother is lucky in the sense that she doesnt know she has it so shes actually happy shes really happy shes in a really nice place i have her in uh a facility that they have a lot of activities to keep them stimulated theres painting and arts and crafts and bus rides and different things that happen um i dont know whose idea this was but someone booked a magician he he was so excited to be there he was wearing a tuxedo that fit him at one point in his life and hes sitting and hes got a table thirteen women in different stages of dementia and pick a card eh i cant see it what is it its a queen of hearts no dont tell her i want you to look at it and just you just look at that and remember it okay all right put it back in the deck now he goes through the whole thing is this your card no yes it is yes thats your card no you picked that card put it back in oh he got so mad he just he didnt even have to do anything he could have left the room and come back oh a magician you know they would have been like god its always interesting having a conversation with her you never know what youre gonna get and not too long ago she said you didnt go to college did you i said no she goes thats a shame i would have been so proud of you i said well i think i did okay i had that show you liked remember the show yeah i still watch it every day i said no i dont think so um yeah i watch it every day i said no its not on anymore and she goes then who am i watching kelly clarkson judge judy i dont know well yesterdays was very good it was the best one yet okay you know i realize now that my whole life was wrapped up in that show and my mothers whole identity was being ellens mom and now i dont have a show and she doesnt know shes my mom she just thinks im a nice lady that visits her although theres a good chance she thinks im kelly ripa but but shes happy and thats all that matters and im happy too uh yeah im happy not being a boss or a brand or a billboard just a person just a multifaceted person with different feelings and emotions and i can be happy and sad and compassionate or frustrated i have ocd and add im honest im generous im sensitive and thoughtful but im tough and im impatient and im demanding im direct im a strong woman thank you thank you thank you so much im proud of who ive become when youre a public figure youre open to everyones interpretation im sure youve heard the saying what other people think of me is none of my business people will say all kinds of things and you have no control over that but you know the truth and thats all that matters but that is easier said than done because being in this business i have had to care what people think because being a comedian or a host its our only real currency for success if they like you youre in and if they dont youre out and ive spent an entire lifetime trying to make people happy and ive cared far too much what other people think of me so the thought of anyone thinking that im mean was devastating to me and it consumed me for a long time but with time you gain perspective which is one good thing about aging it doesnt totally make up for arthritis and brittle bones but but with perspective you realize that caring what people think to a degree is healthy but not if it affects your mental health so after a lifetime of caring i just cant anymore so i dont but if im being honest and i have a choice of people remembering me as someone who is mean or someone who is beloved beloveed beloved beloved someone who is beloved someone who is beloveed beloved beloveded someone whos beloved someone who is beloveded someone who is beloved i choose that thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you have a seat thank you so much wow wow well wow um first of all first of all that was just um unbelievably beautiful and um you know there is just nothing better than being surrounded by endorphins and joy and we dont get that that often now and this was beautiful tonight this was absolutely i um i had no intention of doing a special i had no intention of doing anything ever again after the show and i really uh i didnt think id ever find the funny in it and the fact that i have been able to travel and do this and see the love and support that is still there for me which i didnt know i had um it is its been its been beyond healing to say the words every night toto feel the support and the love and so i am so glad i got to do this im so glad i got to say goodbye on my terms and i cant thank you enough um this is a night i will always remember and uh i i just i just thank you and i just want to bring my wife out here cause its our anniversary shes crying thank you everybody thank you thank you  im taking my freedom   pulling it off the shelf   putting it on my chain   wearing it around my neck   im taking my freedom   putting it in my car

met forest whitaker in line at an ihop ghost dog i met him at the international house this is how it happened right i was in line minding my business and out of nowhere forest whitaker walked in and he asked to use the bathroom and then the woman behind the register she looked at him she realized holy shit thats forest whitaker and then she said the bathroom was for paying customers only and forest whitaker couldnt believe it he was taken aback he looked at her as if to say maam have you lost your mind im forest goddamn whitaker youve seen my eye but the woman didnt budge a bit she just looked right back at him and rolled her neck as if to say sir you aint special this is an ihop everybodys got a fuckedup eye we all fuckedup in the hop thats how we got here and there was this crazy standoff right between forest whitaker and the pancake lady neither one of them budging a bit and then out of nowhere my boy will he was outside smoking he comes back in he sees forest whitaker he goes oh shit forest whitaker you eat at ihop weird choice and ill never forget it because academyawardwinner forest whitaker he looked at us he looked at everybody in the restaurant and he just went man fuck yall best thing know why best thing is crazy because you and i every single person in this room weve all had so many magical experiences that no human should ever have to weigh themselves against know what i mean its almost unfair to ask you to compare your greatest joys to another its look hey ive gotten pussy and cinnabon in the same night thats a miracle this is a better example okay here it is okay this okay last year for my birthday right me and my friends we did a shitton of mushrooms right we got superhigh on mushrooms real fucked up on mushrooms and then we went to a public park we sat on a bench and then we heckled an adult softball league you understand thats how i celebrated my birthday and ill be honest thats the best thing thats ever happened to me so much funnier than a baby this is why it was dope because those people had paid money to be there the players they had worked hard to organize themselves with registration fees and uniforms all under the guise of spending this peaceful afternoon in the park playing sports with their friends and then out of nowhere a group of urban youth white people cant tell how old we are a group of urban youth some rowdy eighth graders showed up and just started yelling weird mushroomy shit at them stuff that didnt even make sense i was sitting on a bench like hey number three you remember bob dole you know bob

i dont im not a train guy im not i just cant help it i and i used to think it was just a me thing you know i used to think i was the only person hard in my local chipotle but after years of careful research ive come to discover its not just a me thing in fact every dude in here has the exact same problem ladies whether hes ready to admit it or not every dude has found himself at work just in a marketing meeting with a throbbing erection he cant explain just avoiding pie charts cause those are making it worse somehow like oh god are we at lord im about to bust i cant i pray to god they dont push that pie chart next to another pie chart cause thats titties and imma cum imma cum from that pie booty we cant control our bodies thats why i dont listen to anything men have to say about reproductive responsibility and the women no cause we be hard we be hard and if you got a hard dick you should maybe tuck it in your belt and shut the fuck up im not trying to hear your harddick opinion you cant be erect and correct at the same time thank you hey imma run for president imma be up there giving speeches hard as hell like damn putin got them big bombs dont he shit putin bombs look like titties fuck big ol titty bombs i think i just have fear about what it means to raise a child you know to bring a person to their greatest potential thats scary fear honestly that existed throughout my wifes entire pregnancy terrified genuinely afraid the entire time i was terrified i was gonna end up with a white baby terrified and ill explain it its not as confusing as you think it is im biracial right my mothers black my father is white my wife is the exact same mix so if im halfwhite and shes halfwhite and recessive genes kick in we could end up with a fucking daywalker a little surprise white baby just a little tamponcolored tyler with varicose veins talking bout daddy im in the mood for poached eggs ew i dont want a white baby i dont want a baby that ages like a gypsy curse why does this baby look older than me i hate it hate this white baby and i dont have anything against white people i dont honestly im a big fan of your work i really am rollerblades yall did that dont let anybody tell you you aint make rollerblades yall are the reason we shred like i said man my fathers white so i okay this is the best way this is it okay it here it is its hard to blame the white man for all of your problems when the white man still pays your cell phone bill im on the devils family plan i cant i cant be that you know what i mean i cant be up here like brothers and sisters i said brothers and sisters and maybe even vin diesel its hard to tell with him what color is that exactly periwinkle looking like a oldass cauliflower anyway we must overthrow the white man we must bring every single white person to justice except for the white people who send me money on my birthday also the entire cast of the office they are hilarious and whichever white person invented fruit on the bottom of yogurt i tried it i love it i love it the other day i ate a boysenberry flavor i took a good healthy poop and i thought oh this is why white people act like that too much power i feel too strong i want to open a private prison and use a neti pot i love it take my shoes off on a plane i love it feels good fear know what my biggest fear is with a kid genuinely this is my biggest fear is how do you make your kid into a good person do you know what i mean if you have kids if youre a parent and i think we can all agree on this youre just guessing all of us youre we plug in a formula we plug in the exact same formula you teach em to share you give them motherfuckers vegetables and shit and then you just hope you just hope your kid doesnt into like a serial killer or even worse one of those people who draws lion king characters with human titties you remember those psychopaths in school those future republican senators any cartoon titty kids here tonight anybody want to fess up to what they did nobody ever raises their hand but statistically that cant be correct the math dont check out cause every class i was in id look over and some kid was disgracing the disney corporation and lets be clear ladies and gentlemen thats not what walt disney wanted walt walter disney walt disney wanted good wholesome content also to exterminate the jews he wanted dead jews and good familyfriendly content and now you look over and some kid is drawing zazu just the bird from lion king with big heavy lunch lady titties big casserole and spatula titties now the bird cant fly talking about simba i cant help you become king my back hurts what god would make me like this simba kill me how do you make them good this is a this is a weird transition after that titty joke but i used to be a high school teacher thats what i did before comedy i taught and grade english im the reason your kid pronounces it liberry i coulda helped i chose not to i wanted to see them flail teachings tough man it you this is what made teaching so difficult for me is that no matter how challenging a kid is right no matter how difficult a kid is you have to maintain this hope this faith that they can still grow into better people right that they can still find the best version of themselves and thats so hard because so many kids deserve to be pepper sprayed right they deserve to be maced in their fucking eyeballs until they learn to contribute to society some of the meanest things ever said to me came from children not my enemies little unwashed people motherfuckers who dont wipe so good this is the meanest thing anyones ever said to me i had a little girl raise her hand middle of class she raised her hand to tell me she didnt think i could ever become a professional male model because i have too much adult acne you understand she interrupted class to tell me keep in mind i wasnt trying to be a male model at all i wasnt doing nothing sexy i was trying to teach this bitch to read but something so hateful in her spirit saw me up there trying my best and she thought to herself uhuh uhuh no way uhuh fuck that uhuh this motherfuckers got too much confidence no this bumpyfaced ngga he believes in himself too much i need to let him know that just in case he was thinking about changing careers male model is not an option i know hes trying to make us think critically about literature but fuck that he needs to think about the back of a proactiv bottle his skin is terrible he looks like multigrain imma tell him imma tell him he looks like bread there are kids who i taught that i still want to fight to this day to this day theres this little bitch named edna ill decap ednas knees if i ever see her again this is really what i want some of yall might work in education i think thisll make sense i want to stab edna in the stomach right i wanna knife her up real good in the belly and then afterward i want to stuff the wound with hot cheetos so shed die all spicy and shit fucking hate edna ednas the reason i stopped writing poetry you understand she stole the magic of verse from me let me be clear this wasnt my original dream i didnt want to perform behind a bar you know what i mean i wanted to be a poet i was oh man im telling you i was going to be a poet i yall i i was gonna write silky metaphors i was gonna wear a thick tweed jacket i was going to go down on weird ladies with hairy armpits i was going to be a poet and then i had to teach an afterschool poetry program for ednas class and every day for eight consecutive weeks that little girl hurt my feelings she made me sad for two lunar cycles and now i want her dead this was a poetry class and this is where i messed up this was my mistake im going to admit that up top this is where i messed up i thought the best way to get these kids to write their poems was for me to share one of my own right huge mis right yeah i get it i fucked up i should have just read them tupac lyrics like my teachers did for me listen up kids first off fuck yo bitch and the clique you claim thats called a stanza even worse the poem that i read them was a poem that meant a lot to me at the time it was a poem about a friend of mine who died in a car crash this girl i know who died in a car crash and in the poem i do all this metaphorical work to compare her death to the death of a spider i found in my windowsill and the final lines of the poem go the exact final lines of the poem go how close to god this spider must feel weaving a world above the earth the string as thin as breath the breath so easily silenced a net of wings fluttering toward blind quiet before i could even finish before anyone even had a chance to process the words coming out of my mouth edna just went damn this poetry nggas gay as hell fucking bitch i oughta kill this stupid little bitch ill punch you in the head stupid bitch punch you dead in your fucking face kids break you they break the person you thought you were going to be and then we subsequently break them and it becomes this ugly cycle of broken people this is a great example of what i mean years ago i read this article about a teacher in idaho right teacher in idaho who got fired from his job he got arrested he got taken to jail because he brought a puppy to school to show his class right seems harmless enough he brought a puppy to the school he showed the puppy to his students and then afterwards he fed that puppy to the classs pet snapping turtle everybody okay i didnt do it im just a reporter you understand he fed a baby dog to a living dinosaur in front of children and every article i read had the same reaction many of you are having every single one was like oh my god what kind of irreparable damage has this man done to these kids what kind of permanent damage has he done to these poor kids and i kept reading those articles and thinking about my experience as a teacher and i kept thinking man fuck those kids fuck them what kind of permanent damage did those kids do to him cause he wasnt like that at the beginning of the year he didnt start off that way that wasnt written in the syllabus they broke him they broke his brain they taunted him and they teased him and they took pictures of his paycheck and they posted it on the internet till one day he snapped and he found himself holding a dog over this ravenous reptile staring out at like is this what you want are you not entertained i swear to god if one more of yall brings up my divorce ill kill this fucking dog todays lesson is

those of you pulling back because i do see some of you youre getting out yeah youre wondering maybe this is too far let me remind you im trying to have sex with him hes not a victim in this situation hes a man who im trying to give some pussy im a hero in this story how do you make a good person people say love love you know the thing that flavor flav and brigitte nielsen have they say thats how you make a good person i dont know if i believe in that i dont know if i still believe in love honestly i just found out that my wife thinks that im special needs and yes she means it in a derogatory way shes a bad lady she should go to jail lock her up the other day she called me from work and she said this to me verbatim verbatim this is what she said to me now keep in mind i have changed some of the words to make me sound better and her sound worse but verbatim this is what she said to me she called me up and she said hey im making chili tonight and i need you to heat up a can of beans then she said and ill never forget it and whatever you do dont put the can in the microwave you understand she told me her emergency contact not to put a can and when she said that i took a deep breath you know i took a deep breath and i really thought about all the time weve spent together the love that weve shared the bond that weve built i took a deep breath and then finally very calmly i said i said i said bitch ill fucking kill you i will kill you dead i will take that gun that we bought after white people tried to take back the country from other white people and i will shoot you in the leg is that what you think of me that im metalinamicrowave stupid you let me cum inside of you you let that cum become a person you leave me alone for hours completely unsupervised with that cum

microwave push the popcorn button and blow his fucking face off and then our daughters gonna have to grow up in a world where people refer to her dumbass daddy as orville deadenbacher its a long way for a pun some say too long thats critique ive heard too long love you want to talk about love my mom my mom has been married four times to four different men four thats a jodecis worth of husbands some of yall are white thats a degrees worth of husbands for the older people jersey boys four different husbands and sometimes i think my moms the only person whos truly figured love out you know what i mean shes the only person who figured out what love is supposed to be because while the rest of us have potentially wasted our lives trying to find some perfect special someone who may not even exist instead my mom gets married every el ni\\u00f1o she finds a new husband every other toyotathon and she just be having fun out there shell marry anybody oldass karate students grown men who order apple juice at restaurants at one point im not making this up my mom married a disgraced nba mascot yeah thats not a mad lib thats a choice she made in front of god and the government and all right lets just start from the beginning ill walk you you have questions i have answers first of all did you know that nba mascots could be disgraced no even worse did you know these disgraced motherfuckers could fuck your mom apparently it could happen to any of us apparently none of our mothers can resist the sexual chemistry of a dishonorably discharged benny the bull my mom married benny the bull and not at his best no dont clap for that shame on you its hurting my family and the next question youre naturally asking you want to know how did he lose his job as benny the bull right how does one lose such a coveted position as chicago mascot benny the bull ill tell you he was fired from his job as benny the bull because and im not making this up in he got caught selling drugs after a game in full costume just standing in the parking lot even the police walked up like benny what are you doing those are your work clothes he was arrested he was banned from the stadium for life and my personal favorite detail they added his name to the wikipedia page when you go home tonight look it up yourself go to wikipediaorgbennythebull and then when youre there scroll down to a section entitled scandals and there you will read about possibly the dumbest man for whom ive ever had to buy a fathers day card love what is it even mean to be a good person you know what i mean given the state of the world what does good person even really mean all of our heroes are monsters and all of our monsters have podcasts what does good person even mean i dont there is no good and bad its not just good and bad its not just right and wrong its not just darkskinned sammy sosa and hellokittycolored sammy sosa there are so many different shades of sammy sosa inbetween my personal favorite tapioca sosa good and bad thats all bullshit this is a great example this is a perfect metaphor of what im trying to say my favorite restaurant in the world my absolute favorite restaurant in the world is mcdonalds how dare you watch your goddamn mouth i love mcdonalds i dont care what anybody says i love it its i love everything about it i like the food i like the service when people show me fight videos at mcdonalds i root for the staff yall dont know how to act in a classy establishment the manager has on a visor show some respect i love mcdonalds the other day im at mcdonalds and i order myself a nugget thats my shit now heres where the story gets crazy because the woman behind the register she winked at me she winked at me and then she gave me nuggets whoo come on some of yall get it some of yall know exactly what happened for those of you that dont dont worry ill explain eleven nuggets is a mistake right thats a miscal she aint go to college thats a miscalculation thats a miscalculation of the nugget eleven nuggets is a mistake but nuggets shes trying to fuck right shes trying to have sex with me for nugget the box doesnt even close all the way with nuggets its just sitting wide open ready for me to come inside put some sauce on it you know what sauce im talking about it aint barbecue it aint barbecue and my wife doesnt even like when i go to mcdonalds she gets so upset oh my god mcdonalds that stuff is terrible for you they make their nuggets out of failed pregnancy tests she says wild shit evil shit about mcdonalds and yet here i was standing in front of a woman willing to give me more nuggets than ive ever experienced in my life just a utopia of nuggets in a bag and i swear to god in that moment in that exact moment it took everything in my being not to run away with the mcdonalds lady yeah not to just run away and start a new life bro wed have a beautiful life the mcdonalds lady isnt going to make me read the mcdonalds lady isnt going to make me fold fitted sheets or vote during midterm elections the mcdonalds lady is just going to give me nuggets shell give me nuggets then shell give me nasty mcdonalds sex gimme just that raw its just sex and nuggets and sex and nuggets and sex and nuggets till we both die at happy just keel over and die from nugget poisoning dead and maybe hear me out yall maybe maybe thats what we all should want maybe thats the dream no youre right maybe thats the dream we should all be chasing lets be honest the world is ending it is thats not political slant you dont gotta agree with it it is ice caps are melting bumblebees are dying they added black people to jackass were done this grown black man being like kick me in the dick johnny knoxville ill try it were done but heres a ray of sunshine i offer you before we go home this evening heres a little silver lining the other day i read an article about a woman who kept a box of chicken mcnuggets for six years six years she kept the box shes single six years she aint seeing nobody she got all them nuggets everywhere she kept this box of chicken mcnuggets and on the day of that sixth year the day that six years hit she opened that box she looked inside youve already guessed it those nuggets were exactly as she left them no change whatsoever no mold no crust them little things that be growing on morgan freemans face those old little ngga chocolate chips he got popping up everywhere nothing and i read that article and i thought to myself holy shit most marriages dont make it six years right most of our promises before god end well before these nuggets ever did maybe all of this is a fallacy maybe all these suggestions of eternity and everlasting are bullshit maybe we should just be eating what we want and microwaving cans and jerking off to the green mm do you know what i mean just beating our meat to the green one cause she got eyelashes and we like that i dont care if you take her boots away shes still got them eyelashes let me see them eyelashes you know what i like maybe the only forever we can guarantee is chicken mcnuggets then i thought to myself holy shit i shoulda got my dick sucked by that mcdonalds lady because maybe the preservatives in her mouth wouldve transferred onto my penis and made my nuggets last forever and that above everything else would be the best thing thats ever happened to me and if you didnt like that joke just know that getting my dick sucked is a metaphor for finding true happiness beyond the broken expectations of a dying world if you did like that joke fuck yeah this final selection from sunset singles this final piece i wanna share with you this evening is untitled theres no title for this one but i will say it is by far the most haunting message that i have ever heard

and cultural journey reflecting on his british indian heritage and family history from childhood memories of watching goodness gracious me with his grandparents to dealing with societal changes class and multiculturalism in the uk shah blends humor and poignant storytelling the show covers themes of identity family sacrifice love and the generational impact of immigration all while maintaining his trademark wit and insightful social commentary in january a sevenyearold boy was sat on the floor of his grandparents living room in alperton north west london three generations gathered round the telly to watch episode one of this new show on the bbc now the boys grandparents had had tough lives right the sort of lives that clad you in an armour and its the sort of armour from which laughter struggles to escape but for the next half hour the boy and his family watched episode one of goodness gracious me and he listened as his grandparents fucking pissed themselves laughing at themselves and with themselves for the first time he could remember and watching sanjeev bhaskar meera syal nina wadia and kulvinder ghir on television the boy thought wait we can do that i didnt know we could do that but if we get to do that then i wanna do that because hearing my grandparents make that sound is the best sound ive ever heard in my entire life over years later would you please welcome to the stage mr ahir shah hello hello hello hello hello hello good evening london are we well fantastic fantastic lovely to have you here lovely to have you in such fine voice hello uh my name is ahir shah that is my name by the way right i didnt used to need to clarify this until a few years ago i was doing this gig in switzerland i was doing a gig in switzerland and the theme of this gig was that every comedian was from a different country right i was the british entrant very modern right and there was one comedian i was particularly excited to meet cause this guys name was ali al sayed now ali is a standup comedian from the united arab emirates of all places right id never met anyone from the united arab emirates let alone a comedian from the united arab emirates to be perfectly honest i didnt think they had comedians in the united arab emirates i assumed hed just be walking onstage being like whats the deal with unspeakable oil wealth hes a very nice man a very funny man after the show all the comedians were all backstage hanging out were all having a laugh having a drink not ali obviously right and we get to talking and he says to me like uh listen bro were friends now i can ask you a question youre not gonna get offended im like listen brother youre from dubai im of south asian origin as long as the question you have for me is not do you want a job on a construction site industrialised slavery you can ask me whatever the hell you like hes like nothing like that i was just wondering when did you decide to start using the hilarious comedy stage name ahir shah right i was like to be honest i dont remember but it was probably december when i plopped out of mrs shah and she and mr shah decided to call their newborn bundle of joy ahir i think thats about when i started going by ahir shah hes like right right okay one thing you should know in case youre ever in my neck of the woods is that in arabic your name means prostitute king he wasnt even fucking with me ahir shah is prostitute king in arabic there are several reasons i didnt think my career would go stratospheric in saudi humble enough to know that i dont have the best bonesaw material on the circuit thats romesh and fair enough right but uh i put this to the back of my mind for several years as you would until uh november i was in egypt doing some work around the cop climate conference they speak arabic in egypt and i dont know if anyone else in the room has ever walked into a hotel and attempted to check in by announcing themselves to everyone working there as monarch of all pimps really changes the vibe in a lobby in my experience they think youre selling something very different to what you are anyway thats me then ahir shah prostitute king to my friends mr shah to you and uh its been a while since ive done a big show like this a lots changed in the world in my life a lots changed in my life im now very much in my thirties now thats exciting shit started falling apart way younger than i was led to believe by the way i thought i had another good decade left in me as it stands everythings already just crumbling my knees are already fucked absolutely no idea whats going on there im trying desperately to get a referral from my gp right sorry for younger people right um a gp right so a gp was a service where like young fellow how old are you mate twentytwo twentytwo so you might remember but in the same way you remember ipods you never had one but youre vaguely aware they existed okay so basically like a gp was this like right imagine youre a bit poorly not super poorly but a bit poorly what would happen was there was this number you called and someone answered right and uh not even necessarily at eight in the morning any time during business hours very forthcoming uh so youd call them and youd be like oh im a bit poorly and theyd be like ah cool come see us soon right and so a couple of days days a couple of days later what would happen was you went over to this right it looked like a semidetached house it wasnt that was the first trick they played its like a sphinxs riddle past that you were golden youd arrive like minutes early youre a conscientious person and youd sit in',\n",
              "  'a sort of uh waiting room and after about minutes someone would call your name and youd go to a separate smaller room and there would just be one guy in there and he would be like i mean he would right cause weve quite a reassuring manner in a lanyard right and youd tell this person what sort of poorly that you were and this was a very welleducated person so you could just be fixed then and there but occasionally itd be a slightly more complex health need and youd get a referral to a hospital right sorry right a hospital now have you ever wondered where the queue of ambulances ends right that is a building known as a hospital funny word isnt it interesting thing you were born in one youll die in one between then youre fucked sorry right uh basically that im obviously being slightly disingenuous there are quite a lot of them generally speaking they were all either built or done up when the prime ministers name was either attlee wilson or blair not sure why not sure why its just a coincidence isnt it what possible intellectual merit could there be in examining why that might have ended up being the case of all things fourteen fucking years fourteen wasted fucking years like not entirely wasted obviously there have been some genuine achievements of conservative government i mean that entirely sincerely by the way my favourite of which is like basically its funny if you ignore all of the noise and just look at the actual underlying data over the last years the tories so successfully decarbonised the british economy and energy mix including all imported emissions that if the countries responsible for the lions share of emissions had been anything like as impressive as weve been over the last years global warming basically wouldnt be a thing the tories did that they did it on purpose it is spectacularly impressive and they cant admit it cause they think it sounds gay other than that its slim pickings out there really is genuinely its worse than its been my entire adult life for sure listen the vibes are awful out there were genuinely skint as a collective in a way that we werent in cause basically in the conservatives were elected by telling a sequence of lies about the british economy and society that they then spent the next years ensuring were true right and is it we need an election yeah we need an election at this stage i would settle for a total overthrow of the current system and the installation of oneman dictatorial rule provided that the man in question was martin lewis the money saving expert right i love that guy i love martin lewis the money saving expert so goddamn much do you sign up to his email oh yeah you do youre a good citizen well done sir if you do not sign up for it do your bit for your country that man is the only thing standing between us and the fucking brink right i love martin lewis the money saving expert so goddamn so for the uninitiated martin lewis hes a moneysaving expert and he runs this website called moneysavingexpertcom and you get a weekly email and its about money saving and the expertise therein right and um basically martin lewis the money saving expert he set up his business for £ right eightzero thats all it cost he is now worth million right isnt that amazing he gives a lot away to things like citizens advice cause he gives a shit unlike the people in charge i love that for martin lewis i love that martin lewis is rich right heres the thing right the reason i love it is that martin lewis is basically the only person i can think of whos got properly rich from helping do you know what i mean take a second to dwell on how rare that is broadly speaking cause theres no money in helping is there we all know that theres money in hindering for sure right theres no money in helping right whens the last time any of you were walking down the street and went oh my god a lamborghini who does that belong to and someones like the lollipop lady right it doesnt happen cause theres no money in helping unless youre martin lewis because that man is rich as balls and the way he got there was by getting all of us together and just being like pizza express for on wednesday dough balls are on me dont worry about it its gonna take more than martin lewis to save us now the state that were in its really bad out there and its weird for me because at the same time as the country i love is so visibly on its knees i am personally happier than i have ever been in my entire life and the two things are entirely unconnected but still feeling personally happy when your country is suffering feels actively distasteful do you know what i mean ive not done it on purpose but its like having chumbawamba stuck in your head at a funeral the reason ladies and gentlemen that i am happier than i have ever been is that in october of last year i got married yeah honestly shes the single best thing ever to happen to me i love her with all my heart shes a civil servant im in it for the pension you have to understand im a selfemployed man before i met her my retirement plan was just to not live that long whereas now my entire financial security and old age is wholly dependent on not upsetting one woman till the day i die right thatll be a new personal best mate in this economy ill try anything right id always known that i wanted to get married eventually i guess there was a certain degree of cultural expectation as well i dont know what to tell you in asian families you get married you stay married its just what happens some of you may know this from your own families maybe friends families you might not be aware of the sheer extent to which this is the case so ill give you the best example i have i started doing standup comedy when i was a teenager right when i was about',\n",
              "  'years old i was given the opportunity to do five minutes at the hackney empire theatre in east london thats a very big theatre people some of you may well have been its the coolest thing that had ever happened to me i was on in the first section so i invited my mum my dad and my sister to come watch and they saved me a seat so i could watch in the second section and the reason i was invited in the first place is that the hackney empire were putting on an evening of british asian standup and i as the new kid on the block they were like lets give little ahir a go thats nice isnt it and so the whole audience soldout show people all british asian all of the performers british asian apart from right about two hours before the show started one of the acts suddenly had to drop out now this is the noughties its not like nowadays where everyones got email on their phones they had to ring around try and find a replacement a replacement was found in the form of my friend the comedian joe bor right now joe is a very nice man hes a very funny man what joe is not is a british asian man right what joe is is a jewish man clearly with two hours on the clock one of the organisers was like fuck i i think jews are basically asian i listen im not saying there arent similarities between the communities my best mates jewish weve been mates since we were years old and its cause the first time we met he told me about his mum and everything that his mum did was either shit that my mum did or hadnt thought of yet theres one crucial difference between the communities as my friend the comedian joe bor found out to his dismay that evening because my friend the comedian joe bor walked onstage in front of brown faces and opened with the line my parents are divorced gimme a cheer if your parents are divorced fucking nothing not a single sound from people i will never forget my mother leaning over and whispering in my ear bless him he has no idea who hes talking to so what happens in asian families for better or for worse you get married you stay married i come from a very long line of very longmarried people uh my parents met at a mutual friends birthday party in india in fell in love at first sight my dad proposed that night they have been married for almost years right um by the standards of my mums family by the way my parents had had quite an extensive courtship uh prior to that i mean like well her parents my maternal grandparents nanaji and nanima i mean the first conversation they had with one another just like oneonone was on the night like several hours after they were already married right its in india it was arranged i dont know what to tell you like they werent complete strangers to one another that would be silly its like the families had exchanged a photograph uh right and um these pieces of paper with a few bits of biographical information on them imagine getting shown that when youre like is this who youd like to marry forever oh yeah i guess then in the end very happily married for nearly a half century until my grandfather sadly died relatively young its so funny talking about this in front of liberal london audiences like its just like you all know that outwardly you have to be like oh the mysteries of the east uh a rich cultural tapestry that may be interwoven with our own internally youre all just thinking thats fucking barbaric the thing is thats fucking barbaric sorry you mean to tell me that two people barely out of their teens and all they had to go on was a photograph and a few bits of scant biographical information and within a matter of days they were in bed together that is fucking disgusting we would never do anything so crass and horrific in our contemporary enlightened western sorry just because youve decided to do it via algorithm not old woman in your village does not make it less arranged right all youve decided to do is outsource responsibility to the one thing somehow less accountable all right my wife and i obviously had a far more conventional relationship uh prior to getting engaged meeting in this country and whatnot it took me a long time to work up the courage to pop the question as they say mate we were going out five weeks and i asked her to marry me um i get shit done theres no point pissing about if you know you know so just get it get it done no point leaving stuff on your todo list for six months things are worth doing quickly and well its the single best decision i ever made absolutely no downside admittedly we were engaged for six months before we could start living together just because like our tenancy agreements didnt spent half my life on a fucking bus then eventually obviously we were able to finally move in together but all that meant was we were two people in our early thirties living in london joining households so now we rent one roof that contains two copies of every ottolenghi book and no realistic pathway to homeownership i love my ottolenghi books though not giving those up even for a house might need the spares love my ottolenghi books hey mate you got an ottolenghi book ah yeah i love it yeah thats the sort of thing you can afford when you get the martin lewis email love my ottolenghi books for this recipe you will need two limes that were once briefly glimpsed by a persian widow or if they dont have that in a shop near you just any lime the thing is you think its bullshit but i got some of the widow limes and you can taste the grief its good stuff actually the salt from the tears adds real depth of flavour i think that shy of having children with someone i think getting engaged getting married its like the most optimistic bet that two people can make on the future',\n",
              "  'just this idea that you can sincerely look at someone and say our lives could be joined in something greater than the sum of its parts stretching forward for the rest of them thats an extraordinarily optimistic way to feel right at the same time as it feels like were embarking on the most optimistic journey of a lifetime it feels like the country around us has just given up you know what i mean its very difficult not to feel like this entire place has called last orders isnt it it is acutely difficult not to feel deeply pessimistic about every element of the future of this country right thats weird enough for me as were beginning this optimistic journey but its doubly weird when i think about the fact that if i were able to get into a time machine and travel to when my grandfather younger than i am now became the first member of our family to set foot on these shores and i would just explain the present to him he would not believe me because he would think i was describing some unimaginable utopia of progress so thats really what im trying to do to take a step back view things through a wider lens a generational lens get some perspective not be so blinkered try not to lose the wood for the trees cause the story of my family is a very typical one for the british indian community i think thats a very relevant story to the past present and future of this country right british indians are by a very long margin the largest minorityethnic group in this country hindus again were talking about millions upon millions none of you know any of that because our entire cultural output consists of my mate nish right and the story of the indian community in this country by and large starts as it did for my family in the and has ended up in the with us now running everything rishi bhai did it rishi bhai did it never thought id live to see the day that rishi bhai did it got that big house in the middle of town now baby rishi bhai did it listen politically im furious racially thrilled ah are you kidding me on an ethnic level couldnt be happier for him and his family increasingly worried about mine very much how i used to feel every time i saw suella aunty on the television jesus christ calm down suella aunty youre gonna get us both killed right uh im gonna talk about the prime minister a little bit obviously ive got to be relatively careful what i say about him because we can all agree theres about a chance that a decade from now i will play him in a channel drama right right not gonna burn a bridge before ive even crossed it are you kidding me i need that money i just wish that i could get across like how wild that day was right i a british indian devout hindu son of immigrants became prime minister of britain on diwali that was a very difficult day in the family whatsapp for me get the family whatsapp up on my phone yes its called the asian network see dad is typing wait for the inevitable ahir have you seen what mr sunaks son has done today still ahir you enjoy mocking your week im sure thats nice for you im glad the shines come off him now everyone knows hes not really up to it at the beginning you all acted like he was the perfect indian boy at the beginning everyone acted like he was the perfect indian boy its cause you just go off the cv on paper right you dont know what i know what does it say on the cv fucking anyone couldve done that what piece of piss who cares what all right fair enough whats the guy done fair enough does well at school gets into oxford does well at oxford gets into stanford does well at stanford starts working in finance becomes a multimultimillionaire in his own right in his twenties largely through executing positions as a big short in that makes him rich enough that hed never have to work again no one even reflects on that cause at stanford he meets and eventually marries the daughter of a genuine indian billionaire whos a very successful businesswoman in her own right they move to the united kingdom where he becomes an mp at an obscenely young age chancellor at an obscenely young age during one of the worst financial crises this countrys experienced then prime minister at an obscenely young age of the country that colonised and expropriated the wealth of his ancestors leading to complex migratory patterns in his familys case via east africa landing him on the doorstep of the most significant address in this country on the most significant day of his faith and everyone acts like hes the perfect indian boy feel free to look this up it is genuinely true rishi sunak never made his school cricket team i was captain of mine thats right that is right any indian father would dropkick the prime minister into a canal to get me all right know what i mean who cares about rishi sunak i want ahir tendulkar mmm hearing a lot about number ten should be batting at number four thats classy his family came here in the too like i i think about that sometimes getting into my time machine and travelling to that cold bedsit in bradford and explaining to my grandfather that when his grandson was a bit older than he was then not only would this be the case but i think the bit that hed struggle with the most is that its not a thing do you know what i mean the news was just like and the prime minister rishi sunak and everyones like yeah that makes sense it is remarkable how unremarkable it is right thats a thing thats worth reflecting upon listen ill always talk about the things we do badly as a country i think one of the things we do terribly as a country is never discussing anything we do well as a country and i do think that when were at our best britain stands basically alone certainly in europe probably in the world as an example of',\n",
              "  'what a properly successful multiethnic multicultural democracy can look like in practice in the century thats something that is worth discussing its why i hate it when you get people on the far right decrying that multiculturalism is some grand failed experiment when you can see its successes if you bother to open your eyes its why i cant stand it when people on my own team right i dont like teams in the first place but listen i voted remain but whenever people are like it was only the european union that gave us our values of tolerance and decency to fuck off anyone else in the room ever been to continental europe while not white its not the relaxing holidaying experience that some of the rest of you may enjoy genuinely a couple of years ago i had to go to this wedding in france i genuinely the way people were i kept asking people i was with like i thought i had something on me turns out i did gonna get an algerian president of france anytime soon or reckon the fashll get there first same question for germany you know listen i think that britain stands basically alone in this thats worth reflecting on right i remember when i was years old walking across the meadows on the south side of edinburgh with my friend the indian american comedian hari kondabolu right i said to him hari bhai i think that when youre part of any sort of visible minority whatever that minority might be what you fundamentally want in life its not necessarily different treatment or special treatment rather it is the ability eventually to get to go without saying to be part of what is just to sort of get to be normal i think if you get to be normal you probably dont realise how cool it is to get to be normal all the time and does political representation get us there in and of itself of course it doesnt right we know this for a fact rishi sunak not even the first pm from a minorityethnic background first way back in the century benjamin disraeli also a tory right would you say that antisemitism does not exist in contemporary britain that would be a fucking stupid thing to say but maybe these things are indicative of the fact that in societies we can over time move towards a position where more and more people can be brought into the circle of who gets to go without saying until that sphere is eventually expanded to include everyone which is where it shouldve been in the first fuckin place i have had the very great privilege of seeing a large amount of this world through these eyes i have been to many countries cities continents doing this and i can comfortably say that britain is yes as the cliché goes the least racist country in the world it just says a shitload more about the world than about britain right and please do not interpret this as any sort of grand political point i think the guys a fucking appalling prime minister hes like genuinely terrible and no one voted for any of this it is abysmal what is happening to us at the moment i do not agree with his politics but by the way thats when you know that something historics happened people use phrases like i may not agree with the politics but no one felt the need with david cameron its just nice for someone like that to get a girl isnt it right but sunak and cameron are basically the same guy cause they went to fancy school thats what explains it fancy school and fancy school runs the country that is not the school that i think about when i think about the prime minister the school that i think about is quite a long time ago and quite a long way away in april an event occurred in amritsar punjab at the time british india that is now known to history as the jallianwala bagh massacre also known as the amritsar massacre this is when thousands of entirely unarmed civilians peaceful protesters and pilgrims were kettled into a very very small area and tens of thousands of rounds of machinegun fire were opened up intentionally on these entirely unarmed civilians at least of whom were murdered probably many more though well never know the true total and thousands more had lifedefining injuries thereafter it is one of the worst and most welldocumented cases of colonial atrocities of british rule in india ive known about that a very long time what i did not know about until an investigation in the times last year was that subsequent to the massacre in amritsar there was a sequence of additional smaller massacres perpetrated in towns and villages surrounding amritsar as the word got out in order to stop the possibility of any subsequent civilian uprisings including one that happened in a place called gujranwala right now gujranwala its about miles away from amritsar its a border town in contemporary pakistan and in gujranwala again thousands of rounds of machinegun fire were let out at entirely unarmed just farmers tilling their fields and over the course of two days ten bombs were dropped including one intentionally dropped on the school as a show of this is how powerful we are and how little of a shit we give about you so dont you even think about trying to fuck with us one of the survivors of the massacre in gujranwala was a twoyearold boy named ramdas ramdass grandson is at time of recording prime minister of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland yeah when when i think about the last century of world history and what might prove possible over time and generations i think about the school in gujranwala rather more than i think about winchester college a punchline would feel distasteful right obviously i wasnt alive at the time but i reckon the way i feels basically how a lot of women felt about margaret thatcher in you dont need to agree with someones politics in order to acknowledge that someone walking through the door means something in and of itself and thats the only way you pave the pathway for others to follow and you cant deny that it works you cant deny that it listen weve now had enough',\n",
              "  'whitelady prime ministers that theyre allowed to be instantly shit that is a staggering achievement for equality in this country are you kidding me maggie and theresa walked so liz could fly liz truss actually very important from a representational standpoint as well uh i mean that entirely sincerely too think about how many prime ministers there mustve been over however long its been did you know that liz truss is the first who just went to a regular comprehensive school isnt that mad right like of children go to a regular comprehensive school i went to a regular comprehensive school i believe of prime ministers should go to a regular comprehensive school admittedly she wasnt a great advert for us right i may not agree with her politics but in case youre trying to square the circle of the educational background and the accent youre currently enjoying uh well uh what ended up happening there was i went to my local comp in wembley north west london i had a wonderful time there but it did have a few police vans outside to stop us murdering each other very thoughtful of them subsequent to that i ended up going to the university of cambridge so i became functionally bilingual in both posh boy and roadman uh uh a few years ago i was doing a tv record in glasgow and afterwards i was having a cigarette with my friend the comedian jamali maddix i was there with jamali smoking making small talk he went you went private school yeah im like oh no i didnt what so i talked him through a few basic facts about my childhood and he just looked at me and went hang on bruv are you from ends well jamali one supposes one was im not gonna do it down i grew up in a wonderful place i went to a wonderful school i hate when people do that down i genuinely it was a really good school if you avoided gang violence cousin marriage it was ofsted good like it was a great environment all the families by and large like mine first secondgeneration immigrants parents may not have had a lot to give what they had was the most important an insistence that education is the best way onward upward outward i think if youve got grand thats a better thing to give to a child and blessed with really great teachers ill tell you about one of my favourites miss lewis now miss lewis i think she had previously taught at a private school i dont know but she definitely knew the extras they were given in order to get ahead maybe thought that was unfair right and so she set up off her own initiative like all great teachers do off her own bat she set up for a couple of years an additional optional latin class of all things and i as you can probably imagine was heavily involved this is what i mean about the transformative power of education you could change everything for young people in an instant i still remember like it was yesterday the first time i walked into that gleaming portakabin bestowed on us by new labour and i sat down and i opened these textbooks that contained these things that id never even conceived of before i was just there being like oh my god its true caecilius est in horto do you know what i mean right led to probably my single favourite experience of my entire time at high school which was one time at the end of term my boys and i were gonna go cinema cause you get a half day the way that you go to the cinema you get the from brent town hall so we were walking to the bus stop and on the way to the bus stop theres this blind alley right and a dozen guys came out to rush us and jack us and shit until one of them just stopped all of the others by going guys ahirs safe yeah i know him from latin i sincerely believe i am the only man in the long history of this sceptred isle who has ever avoided a violent mugging because of latin class uh nathaniel gratias tibi its a great environment to grow up in you know not much cash but a lot of ambition i think thats a good way around to have it generally speaking and realistic ambition as well the families just had realistic ambitions the sort of ambition every parent should be able to rely on the idea that if everyone does their bit works hard the next generation might have it a bit easier than the previous one did that is a reasonable ambition parents should be able to rely on that coming true for their children right now this is not an unreasonable ambition i know all about unreasonable ambition you dont need to tell me about i remember once when i was at uni entirely unironically telling my mate ali that by the time i was in my thirties i wanted to be gq magazines worlds best dressed man right i am now in my thirties and will settle for dressed man and thats a stretch most days listen we all know fundamentally that any sort of vision of progress has to take into account generational investment i think that the part that weve forgotten is that the flip side of that coin has always been generational sacrifice now i might not know much about generational investment yet but i feel like through example i at least know something about generational sacrifice because every day after primary school i would go to my grandparents house in alperton north west london and i would see generational sacrifice continuing to write itself on the faces of nanaji and nanima now quick note on language i speak another language its called gujarati nanaji just means your mums dad you have different words for both sides of the family so maternal grandfather thats nanaji as you can imagine i write a lot of stuff on my computer my computer refuses to accept the existence of the word nanaji and will insist on autocorrecting it every time to the word navajo which has led to three instances where i alone at home have yelled at a computer screen wrong sort of indian now nanaji was the first',\n",
              "  'member of my family to arrive in this country when he was in his twenties in he is probably the reason that i was born here in the first place he is the reason for so much even though he died a fair while ago now hes probably the largest part of the reason why i ended up sounding like this right when he was eventually reunited with his wife and children in this country he said to the children including my mother listen when youre outside youre not allowed to speak to one another in gujarati any more you live somewhere called england now so you need to learn how to speak like proper little englishmen and women and then if you learn how to do that maybe one day theyll learn how to accept you and it sounds kind of weird to our contemporary ears but this was a very commonplace thing in the and a sort of like vocal version of dressing for the job you want you ever heard that phrase right and this has been entirely useless for me but like my uncle is a doctor can you imagine if your doctor looked and sounded like me youd be fucking thrilled imagine that hes doing the ward rounds just like oh good morning how are we feeling today youre thinking this motherfuckers gonna cure me in two hours make lunch plans now nanaji could never integrate in that way himself so i think that his way of doing it was that he worked a succession of almost comically english jobs right so for the most part of his career until he retired he worked at john lewis worked on the shop floor selling curtains fabrics cause its what he knew from the textile factories back in india thats probably the most english place anyone could possibly work youre not gonna get a more english place to work than the john lewis partnership unless the job you had before that was conductor on the big red bus fair play thats the most english place anyone could possibly work you cant hit us with a more english workplace than the big red bus unless the first job you had in this country was literally at the bakedbean factory its where it all started bakedbean factory in bradford baby came over here work on those beans now uh crucially he did not want to uh right by that stage been married for just under a decade had three children had friends enjoyed his work in the textile factory thought he might be able to work his way up and everything very little interest in the united kingdom hitherto no interest in beans right but um it was my grandmother who pushed this like nani quite understandably was like listen just india at the time is just poorer and more violent than anyone with the dumb luck of having been born in this country can remotely conceive of and so she quite understandably was like listen these children arent gonna have the life we wanna give them over here but theyre taking people in england so i need you to go over there you just work it out right ill stay here with the children you send money back to us when youve saved up enough well come join you all right cool see you later bye uh he just did it like pretty soon thereafter just went like listen i like to think that im gonna be a pretty sort of accepting thoughtful type of husband right however if just under a decade from now my wife is to tell me that i must leave her and our three children to move to a different continent with no guarantee of when i would see them again no way of communicating with them no guarantee if any of it was going to work out and no guarantee of my own personal safety that would not be the end of the conversation right however of course for nanaji it was how could it not be thats your dharma thats your duty you have to do it its your duty to your family right so he came over not entirely on his own came with a couple of other guys who did the same left the wives and kids but they didnt really see each other that much for a few years cause they ran a system called the eighteighteight right the eighteighteight is a system whereby as mathematicians in the room can confirm if three men each have two jobs the shifts of which are eight hours long and you time the shift patterns correctly and work seven days a week you only need to rent one bed in one room because one of you can be asleep at any given time while the other two are at work one guy finishes his second shift comes back hits you awake you go off to your first one he falls asleep do that again and again saves twothirds on the rent thats more that you can send to the wives and kids in india and thats the largest expense isnt it whats the secondlargest expense probably food but food taken care of cause at the bakedbean factory they give you a tin of beans protein very important for the second meal of the day they had a big sack of rice and theyd have some boiled rice in a pot apart from sundays obviously because sunday is treat day so the boiled rice contained an onion right some of you are probably thinking surely even in onions are cheap anyone could have onions whenever they wanted from what you have heard so far about my nanima do you believe she is the sort of woman who would have tolerated the profligacy of a sevenaweek onion habit its what you needed to do its what they needed you to do so its what you did eighteighteight five five years he didnt see his wife or children for five years imagine that its not like at least ive got a good data plan or something like that forget about calling that was never gonna happen letters couple of letters a year each time you write one you feel a bit closer every time you buy a stamp youre driving them further away to the extent that my mums first memory in this country is heathrow airport her her brother',\n",

own for five years occasionally just crying over a single photograph and a handful of letters shouldve cried over a lime shed have made some money family reunited in the year after a very prominent conservative politician got on a soapbox in birmingham and said we must be mad literally mad to be permitting the annual inflow of dependents who are for the most part the material of the future growth of the immigrantdescended population it is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre now mr powell was correct about one thing in that that little girl hidden behind the sari did become part of the material of the future growth of the immigrantdescended population because thats quite a mouthful my sister and i tend to go with mum imagine that bringing your wife and kids into that the year after rivers of blood when youve been here on your own since the same year as the smethwick campaign right its fucking grim right just like the violence the aggression that goes without saying its also its always the more insidious stuff that cuts the deepest yeah the thing i suppose like nowadays we acknowledge as having broken him was that he was eventually uh accused of quite serious theft from the workplace uh which was like suspended and investigated for ages entirely cleared hed obviously not done it but it didnt take a genius to work out eventually when you hear these stories that it all starts with a couple of guys at the place being like who do you reckon theyre gonna believe eh imagine what that does to you like your dignity and stuff you have to do it again though tomorrow you have to get up brave face for the kids for the kids its not like the kids have it any easier there has been so much more progress in the last years in this country than there was in the that preceded it and i feel very comfortable saying that because i went to exactly the same high school as my mum and my uncle my abiding memory of that school is a funny story about the time when i didnt get mugged cause of latin hahaha my uncles abiding memory of that school is the people who would flick lit cigarettes at him every day when he walked to and from it my mums abiding memory of that school sticks with her to this day because every time she wants to eat something she has to change her clothes entirely cook eat change her clothes entirely again no matter how many times i tell her that the smell of spices hitting hot oil is the most beautiful smell in the world all she hears is a decade of children telling her how much she stank and he died in so he died only remembering the shit bit and he wasnt old so if hed just hung on he would have seen how quickly it was going to get so different you could have at least seen a bit of that before you left right in im on a train reading a newspaper sorry mate a newspaper right um imagine like a solid tweet right and and on a train reading a newspaper and its the day before the mayoral election in london and theres this big feature article uh where basically sadiq uncle is walking around the city meeting the various voters and talking to them in the feature theres this one guy ive forgotten his name it was a west african name i think hes there with his fiveyearold son and he says to him son i want you to shake this mans hand this is mr khan mr khan is going to be the next mayor of london and in that moment of reading that like my hands stopped working and the paper fell from my hands and the tears fell from my eyes as i thought about the fact that he died in a society where the sentence this is mr khan mr khan is going to be the next mayor of london was completely impossible right and yet years later it had become totally inevitable so what would he have made of witnessing the change in society necessary to make that happen and landing on that sentence in that paper what would he have made of reading a sentence like that what would he have made of reading the words this is mr khan mr khan is going to be the next mayor of london probably not much i dont think he really liked muslims i may not agree with his politics but and thats how i felt diwali before last you know lit my divo i went outside i went back into the kitchen and i poured a little glass of whisky and i said you finding today interesting eh its like obviously problems still exist none of this is to negate any of the problems that were all too aware of right but at the same time pretending that the sort of stuff that i have and have had to contend with is in any way comparable to the sort of things that they had to deal with feels genuinely offensive to me cause this was the generation that never talked about it and so never had it acknowledged and its worth acknowledging cause theyre the ones who changed so much to make so much of what happens now possible right im not an idiot i wander around doing this for a living all around the country occasionally people shout ignorant shit at me in the street like im not oblivious to that and listen my wife is a white irish lady sometimes the two of us are going about our business out and about and people see us together they dont like that too much they make their opinions known theyre all so fuckin old right so old like proper fossils',\n",

its not like societys a football match where someone blows the whistle and we decide what the results been but at the very least i can acknowledge that im not the one who scored the goals im a sub theyre the ones who scored the goals they scored the goals and ran straight back to the net and pulled it back to the halfway line cause they knew that no matter how hard they were trying every single day they were still two down right and is the point of my generation one more not only of maintenance but also trying not to lose grip on this extraordinarily fragile thing that exists around us its worth acknowledging how fragile this thing is right because you see people young people trying once again to sow sort of any sorts of division in this society were trying to build and you just think what the fuck are you doing what are you doing surely the point if the point is anything the point is to create a society in which one day everyones children get to go without saying i think that you have to be staggeringly naive to believe that thats possible and i refuse to be anything else its so easy to despair right despair is the easiest position to have its definitely my default it just turns out that despair is a deeply unproductive emotion right try something else yeah my wifes way better than me at this like shes just generally speaking quite stable and well adjusted i used to think that she was some sort of superhero or something turned out its because she has absolutely no socialmedia presence whatsoever uses the internet sparingly if necessary for work if we were all slightly more like her wed all be slightly less fucking insane by the way no ones changed their names theres no mrs shah to this story fortunately for all of us in irish her name means prostitute queen didnt even take five weeks not really there was a point one week stood opposite her in the kitchen and just all of a sudden its like the trailers stopped like all life up to that point had revealed itself to be the trailers and all of a sudden every atom of the world outside of the two of us was whispering in unison shhshhshhshhshhshhshh shh the pictures about to start and now i get to see how it goes thats it i mean the endings gonna suck right im not gonna know too much about it though gonna die first get in love it are you kidding me listen its like shes really like oh no we shouldnt have processed food in the house and all i want to do in my life is fuck a chicago town pizza while chainsmoking and doing lines of salt its nice to feel like youve had one of your last beginnings yeah frees you up to think about where things end up its the interesting thing with love right love the way that it begins begins in as many ways as there are people if we were ever to have a conversation and you said to me ahir can i just check were you in love on your wedding day wouldnt that be a ridiculous question youd never ask cause the answers obviously yes right what i find fascinating is that if you were ever to meet my grandmother and you were to say ramila can i check on your wedding day were you in love it would be an equally ridiculous question cause the answer would obviously be no of course she wasnt right there she was little more than a girl sat opposite little more than a boy total strangers functionally of course she didnt love that boy right and yet it began it began right wild did she love the boy she was sat opposite on her wedding day of course she didnt right did she love the young man just under a decade later who was willing to move continents because he knew thats what the people who relied on him needed from him in that moment of course she loved that man she loved that man for the next five years as she held up her end looking after three children while occasionally taking a moment to cry over a photograph and a handful of letters of course she loved that man she loved that man in heathrow airport the photograph made flesh once more as those three children hid behind her sari because they barely recognised the man who had done so much for them of course she loved that man she loved that man as she took his hand and walked forward together into a society infinitely more hostile than the one that has been bequeathed to me as a direct result of their actions she loved that man as they danced together shielding one another from as many slings and arrows as humanly possible for the next decades until his end she loved that man she loved that man in and well past that as you will know if you go to a living room in alperton north west london and see a photograph on the wall with a fresh garland of flowers that you pray to when you visit of course she loves that man thats where it ends up nanaji died in a week after his birthday hed just turned oi hed brought a slightly hastened end onto himself really uh basically when he retired he wanted to spend as much time in india as humanly possible but his lungs had been fucked since his twenties cause of the fibres in the air in the textile mills the place in india my family are historically from a city called ahmedabad its incredibly polluted makes central london look like the fucking peak district and so he would go over there and come back weaker diminished and he came back and after the second trip his grownup children had to get him sat down in his own living room and my mum had to say to her own dad you are killing yourself right thats whats happening',\n",
              "  'here thats whats its perfectly clear you go there you come back youre weaker youre smaller youre more diminished and can you not see what is happening to you its not even about seeing akshay is a doctor he can hear what is happening based on your breath and diagnose you do you not feel what is happening so heres the thing youve had your fun youve had two trips but now you stay over here right cause we love you very much so we wanna keep you around thats how were all gonna look after one another so youve had your fun but youre not allowed to go any more here you are good yes and he had to look at three adult children and say no i never wanted any of this right i never wanted any like my entire life it turns out has just been this means to an end and thats fine its fine because you are the end so if i had to do it again i would with a snap of the fingers and a smile on my face i would do it again but can you not understand that i just need this at my end i can feel it far more than you can see it or he can hear it do you not understand i dont care i dont care because when i go over there no one looks at me like im any different or yells at me or spits at me like im any different because im not any different when i go over there i am a normal guy i have been a normal guy since the day i was born i just havent felt like it in so long you dont understand that when im over there i get to go without saying and i havent gone without saying since nineteen sixtyfuckingfour he used to run off the plane as quickly as possible sprint across the tarmac as quick as fucked lungs would carry him and go to the first part of the airport that wasnt paved over fall to his knees and just start digging fistfuls of earth with his bare hands he would dig up the earth and he would put it in his mouth can you imagine dig the earth and put cause you miss a land so much that you need to dig it and put it in your mouth but you had to leave you had to leave because thats what they needed and if they needed it its what you had to do he would dig the earth and put it in his mouth it cant have helped a third and final trip to the only place on the face of this earth that would do a normal guy the basic decency of getting to go without saying and it killed him thats how much every human being wants that you need a pretty damn good reason not to give it to them when he did die he died in this country in a hospital dyou remember hospital and my mother was next to him sat down he was in a bed not speaking any more it was just the beeps you know most of us have heard the beeps and a nurse came by saw my mum and said oh you must be mr vaishnaws daughter she said yes i am and the nurse said well listen im new to the ward so i didnt get a chance to speak to him but ive spoken to some of the other nurses who did and they said he was a good man and my mother squeezed the hand of a man she had barely recognised in heathrow airport in and said he was the best of men and the line went flat and if nanaji were capable of hearing in that moment then the very last thing he heard on this earth was the little girl it had all been for saying that he was the best of men and like objectively he wasnt do you know what i mean not a baddie but just you know a normal complex flawed human being like absolutely everyone in this room and probably we could give one another a bit more of a break than we currently have the appetite for i suppose yeah but for someone for someone which it turns out is the only way that you can be of course he was he was the best of people for someone he did what they needed from him when they needed it from him he did the best that he could for the people he loved if you can do that then you can be the best of people for someone if you can do the best you can for the people you love and who rely on you then you damn well get to go without saying in my book it is not that i have currently had some sort of grand revelation that sacrifice is somehow more impressive or important than achievement the truth is what the truth always was in the first place which is that the sacrifice is the achievement and with that in mind i know full well that till my end krishnadas vaishnaw will remain the most impressive man i will ever meet i have wanted to do this since january sat on the floor of my grandparents living room in alperton north west london listening to nanaji and nanima laugh at episode one of goodness gracious me and for just over a decade i have had the absurd privilege of calling it my career but its not the job not any more and it never will be again i hope the job as i understand it is what nanaji understood the job to be he was a good husband and a good father for the people who needed him to be when they needed him to be he was the best of men and i am now in front of you the worlds best dressed man because i get to stand in front of you and tell his story while wearing his waistcoat because i am finally dressed for the job i want and it will be the hardest job of a lifetime but with you nanaji ill be able to do it i hope sorry hope thank you very much'],\n",

didnt sleep so good last night i mean like every day heres another thing that i didnt see coming as you get older do you find you get hurt in ways you didnt used to get hurt i injured myself doing something stupid which by the way that is the number one cause of injury in this country is doing something stupid you ask anybody how they got hurt i guarantee you the first thing theyll tell you yeah it was so stupid its like yeah of course right because nobody gets hurt doing anything smart youve never heard of that i was working on algorithms for the space program and my brain just caved in

pathetic muscle i had fell it just fell so instead of being like a gradual little mound it was a puny hill gathered at the bottom it was just it didnt hurt but it looked wrong so i said ive got to get this fixed so i had to find a surgeon orthopedic surgeon my friend says i got the guy for you i got the guy i got the guy dont even look around he said i got the guy my guy i got the best guy my guy is the best do you ever notice all your friends always have the best guy nobody has the seventh best dentist youve never heard that i have the best proctologist no theyre all the best they cant all be the best like my regular doctor my checkup guy hes not the best i know that hes and im fine with it hes okay hes like hes in the top in his building i would imagine you know hes fine hes fine hes is not a particularly great doctor but hes got terrific parking and i love that the in and out of there but my friend said no you got to go hes great hes great youre gonna love him and he kept selling i said im going he said no youll love him hes a great guy great guy hes very thorough great guy great guy and then he says and hes really handsome im like okay its not something i generally look for

lie to you even with my friends warning i was still a little thrown like whoa look at you hang on look at you thats a goodlooking guy look at this guy with a square jaw and a full head of hair thats a goodlooking guy it struck me that shouldnt be if youre already the top surgeon in the country you dont get to be goodlooking too thats not right pick one or the other thats not how this works pick one or the other its like sometimes you meet somebody and theyre really attractive and then they turn out to be stupid you go fair enough okay pick one but this guy he was great he was very thorough he did an mri did an xray he said you know well you did some damage he said he goes you have a little tear in your rotator cuff he said but thats not your big problem he said your big problem i said i know im emotionally unavailable he said perhaps its not my area he said your your big problem get ready he said your bicep is partially detached i said hang on doc i gotta throw up a little bit i said why would you say that he goes i see it all the time i said all right so what do we do now a little surgery he says well you can but you dont have to i said what does that mean he said well the best i can do is im gonna bring you back to where you were before you hurt yourself he said but youre telling me you can do everything i said yeah ive got full range of motion he says all right and youre not in any pain i said no theres no pain and he says yeah so i would just leave it i said is is that where im at are we already there is that whats happening were just gonna run down the clock now is that what were doing just leave it oh my god if i was real estate im not even a fixerupper im a teardown just stick it out as long as you can but i wouldnt put more money into it at this point he said i can hear you when you say that i said no were gonna do the surgery dr handsome and ill tell you why i said were gonna do it because if we dont i think that sends the wrong message to all the other parts that are still working i mean they see a tendon float by they go look at this he doesnt even give a shit anymore the whole place is falling apart why should we pump blood to his heart hes not gonna be around you know so i did the surgery and im happy to report that after months of rehab and thousands of dollars he was able to make me exactly as weak as i was right before so there you go

maybe dont say it because if you say it ill have to think youre a racist no offense no offence i mean you know no listen we all want to be terrific parents we want we aspire to be great parents but if were being honest were all winging it we dont know what the hell were doing none of us know what but if theres one skill if theres one skill that you need to be an efficient parent you have to worry thats the main thing you have to worry i dont judge anybody but if you have kids and youre not worried i dont think youre doing it right you have to worry im not saying do anything but just worry start there its an important skill to have and not to brag im very good at it im very good at worrying even if theres nothing to worry about ill make something up i dont care i do ill lie in bed make up lists come up with lists like ways to get hurt i had not thought of previously and by way all the things i worry about they never happen they never happen nobodys ever gotten their head stuck in a lawnmower okay but i thought of it it could have happened nobody ever reached into a dryer to pull out socks fell in and ended up drying to death thats not the thing you know and ive been around long enough to know that worrying it doesnt help it doesnt prevent anything right it doesnt even it doesnt even prepare us for anything but still we prepare i know i prepare if im on a plane and we hit a little turbulence you know the five seconds where you think youre going down i prepare by doing this because this is really all the insulation you need upon impact this is that way if the plane does go down and im the sole survivor i can tell everybody you know what kept me alive i had my fists balled up very very tight and to be honest my asshole was clenched shut like a bank vault on a sunday that puppy was closed for business nobody getting in or out of there that was closed so when we hit i just bounced right up thats what happened there i was im the only one we hit a pow bounced right up i was saved by the grace of god and just the the sheer rigidity of my own sphincter thats what did it pow i told you this would not be important didnt i it has been a crazy year well for everybody but lets lets focus on me a lot of upheaval in my family we moved we moved this year and the kids found us that was surprising i did not anticipate that kind of followthrough no we moved it was a big deal for the kids because we had been in this house for years so their whole childhood was in this house and heres what i learned you know you cannot sell your house until you fix it up did you know that because nobody in their right minds is gonna buy your house after what you and the kids have done to the place living like animals all these years no new people deserve better dont they all the things that never bothered you enough to fix while you lived there youre gonna snap to it for these next imaginary people so they shouldnt have to live like monkeys in a pile of their own filth so we got to work we steamed the furniture cleaned the carpets painted the walls outside new shrubs new hedges new grass new flowers suddenly i looked around and went this place looks great boy i wish we lived here this is ill tell you its not until you move and you start opening cabinets and closets its not until then that you realize just how much crap you have accumulated you shouldnt have to move just to get rid of crap you know we could theoretically get rid of a little crap every once in a while and whittle it down but thats not the way crap works no crap likes to stay out of sight where it grows in the dark just as your family has grown over the years so has your crap thats kind of if you think about it its kind of the arc of life first half of life were just getting stuff get stuff you cant get enough stuff get stuff get to a certain age get rid of that stuff get rid of that stuff get rid thats the roller coaster of life accumulate shed accumulate and then shed we accumulate things and people we accumulate people when youre young you cant meet enough people right you mean a nice couple we should get their number i like them we should be friends with them and their other friends i like them too get their number well all get together the six of us well have dinner and if that goes well well get an rv i think well all go cross country i think i have a good feeling about these people you cant get enough and then you get to a certain age you go the other way all these people that you were so eager to meet now you know what i dont want to see these people anymore im tired of

hand it could go the other way kid might go youre getting rid of this oh i love this thanks and thats where youll go you know what let me have that back i was on the fence to be honest but when i saw your enthusiasm i realized i was a bit hasty but one way or another whether you throw it out give it away donate it the garbage pile goes away save pile thats very simple just put everything in a box kick it down the road youll deal with it next time you move or just wait till youre dead and the kids can fight over who wants it less then you get to the mother lode the not sure pile this is where a

it back who cares i dont know why they ive gotten very skeptical of any kind of any kind of you know notice or i got a thing on my phone the other day those updates your data storage cloud is completely filled and my brain went straight to is it though is it really is it oh yes it is filled thats why were reaching out it is totally filled thats weird because i never put anything in the cloud well be that as it may its stuffed it is totally stuffed shits falling out of your cloud i hate to tell you the other clouds have been mentioning it because its not pretty whats happening its just disgusting up there its coming out of your cloud can i see the cloud no nobody sees the cloud nobody not nohow but it is stuffed thats why were ill tell you what though for i can get you a bigger cloud youre gonna like this cloud you cant see this one either but trust me its the el grande i dont trust these people i dont trust them and by the way they dont trust us they dont trust us how many times have you gone on a website and they dont even believe that youre a human being and they have to screen you are you a robot we wont be mad just be honestly are you a robot let me ask you if i',\n",
              "  'was a robot why would i tell you doesnt that kind of defeat the whole purpose of being a robot because robots are not stupid you know we program robots to do a lot of smart things ill bet you with a little extra effort we could teach them to lie its not that hard just type it in if they ask are you a robot you say no you can even program a little attitude do i look like a fucking robot you know why couldnt they do that okay okay but theyre expecting that theyre ready for the lying robots thats why they always have that secondtier test the little picture test with the eight pictures which picture has a school bus or a chimney or a crosswalk or a palm tree you would think thats easily within the realm of what a robot could do right no they cant theyre stuffed they stymied by the picture test they get that far and then they go we dont know what that is its yellow and big and ah we gotta go back cant do it they cannot do it whereas i not to brag am very good at these tests i i i am i get them all right every time im very good at it i can school bus school bus not a school bus not a school bus school bus not a school bus not a school bus give me another one come on no i know im already in but im enjoying myself keep them coming what have you got all right chimney chimney not a chimney not a chimney chimney chimney not a chimney crosswalk crosswalk little piece of a crosswalk that counts crosswalk little crosswalk no crosswalk but theyre not always easy sometimes they try to trip you up palm tree palm tree well it could be a ficus you know what hang on i dont know how specific they want to be with the trees you know i figured out why i love these tests so much im just so happy to be asked something i know because theres so much i dont know because the brain can only handle so much theres a certain point in life theres not much that can get in there you know all these things that im talking about as we age they dont all happen at one time which that would be nice if they gave you a date and they said heres your old person date and then you can prepare and thats the day when everything just goes bad but they dont do it like that they just eat get out its like a slow drip every week i notice something new that worked better a few weeks ago like the last couple of years i was squinting a lot my eyes were i was squinting recently i noticed im going the other way just whoa whoa opening my eyes wide this isnt working thats got to do it ill throw more vision at the problem ill will it into focus first time i noticed i was on my computer and i realized i was making the font a little bigger every week first time you go from a to its like night and day you go thats fantastic why didnt i do this years ago this is fantastic but then its like crack you cant get enough you go is even better than look at that you know what nothing to be embarrassed about that then oh thats pretty damn good i mean like im at and honestly just you can read it from out of town thats how big the i had to get reading glasses never had reading glasses took them home still couldnt really make out the computer i called the eye doctor i said these glasses are not really working the computer is still blurry he said oh did you want computer glasses you told me you wanted reading glasses i said what he said yeah those are two different focal lengths reading your book is six to eight inches from the eye a computer is generally to inches from the eye i said yeah but you could move the computer he said but you wont i said thats so true he said ill give you another pair use that for six to eight use the other pair for to i said let me ask you this what if theres something in the middle and he said dont look at it what do you want me to tell you he said nine ten eleven inches thats going to be a dead zone ill tell you right now i can help you up to eight or after in the middle youre on your own nothing i can do if anybody approaches in that area tell them move up or move back but dont hover so i got reading glasses i have computer glasses i have driving glasses i have driving at night glasses if im in my house and i wanna look out the window separate for glasses for that i got like pairs of glasses now im solid i got all the glasses i need problem is my brain is fading i dont know where the glasses are so so theyre not helping theyre not helping and i had heard about that shortterm memory they always tell you as you get older your shortterm memory will diminish so i was anticipating a little hit to the shortterm memory what i didnt understand was just how short the term is its a short term i was talking to my friend i said hey this trip youre going on is that for business are you going just for fun he said oh the latter and i went i dont remember what order i just said it i just said it thats not a memory thats now thats shortterm now im losing my now i dont remember anything anymore but im honest about it i tell people right up front as theyre talking to me i will tell them hey just so you understand this is the same as if you werent talking to me okay just no i can hear you and its nice to see you but its not going in thats what im saying if its important',\n",
              "  'write it down wait you know what tell my wife but im telling you i cant hold it i have maxed out my cloud is totally filled i cannot it cannot go in there sometimes i do remember what people tell me but then i dont know who told it to me thats the thing i spend a lot of my life going who was i talking to who was i talking to i was just talking about that yes the zebra that exploded in the zoo we were talking who was i talking to i heard who was i talking to thats why its great if youre married if you have a if youre in a couple if youre married youre in a couple you have a builtin backup system you just go honey who were we talking to about the zebra huh who were you werent there who was i talking to do you have any idea where have i been the last four or five days any recollection who could i have been talking to thats what im trying to get throw some names at me ill see if anything rings a bell are you not keeping track remember i asked you to keep a list of where i go and who i talked to yes i did i asked i didnt ask you i asked somebody who was i talking to i could have sworn that was you and again see we know these things are gonna happen weve seen it happen with other people so we know its coming but we dont know when we dont even know in what sequence these things will happen so right now at this point im just on constant lookout waiting to see which bodily function goes south next and i had a frightening moment i was driving and i accidentally with my elbow i hit the little dial for the seat heater so the pinholes are shooting up heat but i didnt know that i did anything do you understand so im driving im minding my own business and just all of a sudden hmmm this is new this is new i just noticed from the waist down everything was hot it was like a general hotness in the bottom half of me and my first thought im not proud of this but my first thought was i think i just shit myself yep make a note sweetie todays the day it started i hmm no i dont feel sick at all thats whats surprising no i no i didnt eat anything out of the ordinary you were with me the whole you saw i was just sitting here driving and dropped a load i dont know how to put it to you but were going to pull over change my pants and get a new car because we cant live like this we cannot live like this these are just some of the wonderful highlights we can look forward to on our journey but ill tell you you know if youre lucky enough and you have the right partner on your journey it makes the whole trip a lot more manageable and a lot more entertaining if youre lucky enough to have the right partner and right it helps it helps and i have to say i am very very lucky i married a wonderful woman initially but you know what no let me finish let me heres how hard marriage is i absolutely married the perfect woman shes beautiful shes intelligent shes independent shes successful shes kindhearted shes a great mother and were perfectly matched we had the same values the same taste same sense of humor same everything couldnt be more perfectly matched for each other and still with all that three out of five days im slamming my head against a wall so thats how hard it is i have a friend whos not married hes like in his not married never been married and hes never going to be married and the reason i know that is he tells me all the time defiantly ill never get married he says i dont care what you say paul i will never get married and i tell him i dont care i said i dont get a commission you understand that i i dont work for the organization just had the little tv show that was the whole extent of it im not involved he said but hes mystified by my marriage he said how do you do it how do you stay with one woman your whole life whats the secret i said what do i know i said i dont know a secret i said ive only been married one time to one woman i said and by the way in all that time ive only learned one thing if im being honest i said and ill give it to you if it helps ill share it with you this is what i told him this is the only thing i know to be true i said to him i said when youre with a woman sometimes youre going to want to say something but if a little voice in your head says i wouldnt say it now you want to listen to the voice thats all i can tell you its there to help you you may have a question and it can be a perfectly reasonable question but if you hear a voice say all right but i wouldnt ask it right now trust the voice thats why its there youll never regret it nobody gets to the end of their life and goes oh if only i could ask more irritating shit i could have i could have i had the opportunity and then i didnt do it no because by the way even if what you want to say is sweet and loving and wonderful it can come out wrong as i have learnt so okay this happened the other day i had a really a lovely moment i was watching my wife in the house and i just was watching her and i was overcome with a really wonderful feeling of appreciation and affection and gratitude i was just watching her im going god am i lucky i said what a wonderful im so lucky i married',\n",
              "  'such a wonderful woman and i said boy she does a thousand things a day that we dont even know about that just keep the trains running and make our lives great and she does she does everything for us and boy god forbid something ever happened to her id be lost i wouldnt know how to go on my life would be empty and hollow without her this is what im thinking my wife sees me staring at her oddly she said what heres what came out of my mouth nothing i was just picturing if you were dead you see what im saying thats not reflective at all um what i you see that its very hard to clean that one up ill be honest but you learn you learn over time there are certain things you can only learn in a longterm relationship i have learned okay heres an example so when were sleeping my wife who i adore just so were clear when were sleeping she doesnt snore because women dont snore i understand i understand having said that there is a noise uh coming out of this area of her there is a noise that if you didnt know better youd go that sounds like snoring and i actually kind of i dont mind it i find it endearing for the first few minutes anyway i just marvel i go really really a face that beautiful could make a sound that atrocious that doesnt seem possible but after a few minutes you want to go to sleep so heres what ive learned again only over time if you put your hand on her shoulder and gently shove gently you know what practice on the dog listen to me the dog is sleeping on the bed and starts snoring just goay if you hear thats too hard so thats how you know just you want to dial that down but not too soft because then youve accomplished nothing so you want what youre aiming for you want to break their breathing cycle thats what youre going for and youll know you do it right when you hear this sound thats it its not pretty its not a pretty sound but thats whats its like throwing a wrench under a tractor its not nice but thats your cue to turn over and go the hell to sleep because if you linger her eyes will open and shell just go did you just shove me and you have to go i dont think so in fact im sleeping so i dont even know why youre talking to me see i i try to live by the golden rule and we all know the golden rule do unto others as you would have done unto you its a great idea in life its great in life in marriage not so much uh it doesnt always work in marriage because ill be honest there are many things i would happily have done unto me that she dont like done unto her and and shes very vocal about it she goes i dont like when you do that and it sounds like im talking about something dirty no no i mean simple things simple if shes driving and im in the passenger seat and i politely point out that our exit is coming up oh she gets so insulted you dont have to tell me i know i said well all right i you know hey sometimes you point it out to me and i dont get offended she goes right because you dont mind i said right what no im saying i dont mind she goes right but i do because im not you and thats when i go well then the golden rule is not fucking working here is it because i only know me i dont know who else to draw from if the golden rule is not working lets try the silver or the bronze because the silver rule i think do unto others best guesses of what you think they might like done unto them and the bronze rule is you know what dont do unto anybody anything just sit there eat your chicken wait till the shows over just dont get involved and i dont wanna give you the impression you know im talking a lot about my marriage and its all good you know i dont want to its all good know what im saying its not all good but you know what im saying its all good in general its all good its like the world from space looking down its all good you zoom in close its not all good you know what im saying but you have to scale back and its all good when my friend asked me you know whats the secret i said i must have learned something and i said actually i do have something i have something for you and this i do believe to be true for any longterm relationship to keep it growing and keep it moving you have to constantly find something new to fight about that is so important i cannot stress that enough so like in my house the current friction du jour that im enjoying immensely uh my wife who i adore we understand she has come to view with displeasure my response time do you know what i mean by response time the gap in the time continuum from when she asks me something to the microsecond that i answer that gap is not to her liking she she would prefer a snappy or brisker retort than the one i am affording and in fairness to her i got to be honest a lot of times i do respond but in my head i just forget to talk i thats not her fault thats on me i did i not speak i thought i spoke i you know i just ran out of steam at i just ran so sometimes i dont answer because of whatever that phenomenon is sometimes though i dont answer because to be honest i didnt hear the question i didnt hear it the hearing is not as crisp as it used to be but thats not all the time sometimes i dont answer right away because im thinking she asked me a question',\n",
              "  'id like to give an intelligent thoughtful response she doesnt buy it she if i dont answer it right away she presumes its just because im old and deaf so what shell do is shell repeat what she just said louder and with ten times the hostility it jumps it goes from what do you want for supper straight to what do you want for i know i heard you sweetheart i heard it i was thinking maybe i shouldve have gone ah do do do do do would that help you dodododo chicken and by the way her hearing is going too however its not her fault its not her fault the way i understand it if i dont hear her thats because my ears are going bad if she doesnt hear me thats because i dont speak clearly so you see the problem yes this is the problem area either way you come at it here seems to be the problem and i called her on it one day i said sweetie its always me really its always me its never you she said yeah now get the car were late i said what where are we going she said were not going anywhere i said why did you say get the car were late she said i said you need to articulate i said okay its not how i heard i said well maybe you need to articulate and then she mumbled something about going to truck yourself we dont have a truck so you know it doesnt even make sense you see what im saying yeah shes starting to lose it this is my concern yeah and all married couples go through it my parents went through this i remember in their golden years my mother called me one night she said im worried about your father its like he doesnt hear me its like he doesnt hear me so she got him to go to an audiologist the guy was like the best in town he was fine but this guy was smart first question he said to my father mr reiser let me ask you how long are you married my father said years why the doctor said theres the problem no apparen theres a medical thing apparently if you hear the same voice for that duration of time it wears down that particular frequency in the ear canal thats whats happening thats a scientific thing both ways him to her her to him him to him them to them pronouns are not an issue any two people over time will overtax that pathway you can hear above you can hear below but that pathway dead my problem is a little more subtle like i said i hear everything my wife says but apparently i hear it wrong i hear well if she said what i heard were doing fine but often its not what she said we were in the kitchen the other day shes standing in front of the cabinet where we keep the candy and shes squinting shes looking into the candy cabinet and she asked me i thought for the name of our ophthalmologist well i saw her squinting it didnt seem unreasonable so i said schneiderman what our ophthalmologist is dr schneiderman okay why are you telling me that i said did you not just ask me the name of our ophthalmologist she said no i said what happened to all the hot tamales i said all right well thats not how i heard it but i can see why saying schneiderman wasnt helpful there unless schneiderman ate the hot tamales but how could that no it couldnt be its and what makes it extra tricky sometimes youre not supposed to respond sometimes youre not even supposed to be listening sometimes yes sometimes no but its not always clear what rules are in effect at any given moment so my lovely wife who i adore weve established right she will walk into the room and shell very quietly go meh i cant believe it i go whats the matter shell go i was talking to myself i said okay sorry and then at the exact same volume shell go where did i put my phone hello that was to me then the second part so the second part was to me okay so the first one no but the second one was to me you were talking to me she said do you see anybody else here im like mmm mmm i thought you were talking to yourself she said well evidently i was okay i said my beloved we need a system we need a system help me help you how do i know when youre talking to me and when youre talking to you she said it should be obvious i said its not its not if it were obvious we wouldnt be having this conversation but its always its only the little things like i said all the big things we get along on all the big things we agree its only the little things that will come up and sort of jeopardize a perfectly good union and i was this was again i dont know what things were sitting around i had my phone out and i was trying to plan my week yeah and i said to my wife casually very casually i said sweetie are we doing anything saturday night she said are you kidding me im like whoa and my knees buckle a little bit i said whoa whoa i think im forgetting something quite significant saturday are we getting divorced saturday is that i thought that was just an idle threat but is that happening im sorry what is saturday she goes were having dinner with rob and beth i said oh so thats on were doing that she said are you kidding me she said youre the one who asked us to make it saturday remember we had a whole conversation she said we were going to do it two weeks ago but you couldnt do it and you asked me to see if they could move it to this sat do you really not recall this whole conversation and i said well the first half yes i remember asking you to see if they could move it but',\n",
              "  'they never got back i never heard back that yes they can do it and yes were on she said okay well but i told you i said how do we know that do you have film of you telling me i said why do you assume i forgot that you told me maybe you forgot that you didnt tell me that could happen and it wouldnt have been a big deal but it happened to be the third day in a row i forgot something stupid and thats the one that broke her it broke her it was one too many she wasnt angry she went beyond anger to a state i had never seen uh she just looked at me differently she looked at me with such a look of compassion and affection and just genuine just it was just so angelic she looked at me and she said im worried about you im i think we have to have you checked i said checked for what she said i dont know dementia or early onset something something is happening i said sweetie years ago it would have been early this is on time this this is yeah this is on time onset thats what this is this is precisely when onset would set on i said but play it out how would that even help you lets say i go to a doctor he looks in my head and goes yeah we see that hes got a thing theres something sitting on his memory and thats why his memory he is forgetting things because theres a thing on his memory how would that help you she said cause at least then i would know i could adapt i would adjust i would write things down for you id repeat things id be more patient id be nicer i said why dont we go straight to that if you got a perfectly good solution why would you hold it back like that she said no im not gonna unless you have a note from your doctor im not going to be nicer no no unless you have an actual medical condition im not going to assist you step up your game and you start remembering these things because this is not okay i said why dont i split the difference say i got a little bit of something and you just be a little bit nicer and then well bump it up every year a little bit little bit little bit till we get to the end of our lives i said youll be the nicest person in the world and i wont remember any of this thank you so much folks thank you denver im going to say one thing and then ill let you go thats how i get off the phone with my family and friends by the way i go you know let me let you go sometimes they trip you up we dont have to go all right well let me let you let me go i dont know how im pulling the plug one way or the other now i just wanna say one thing you know at the top of the show i said i wasnt going to say anything important i changed my mind im gonna say something very important and im gonna hear this im gonna share with you the secret of life im going to tell you the secret of life but it came to me in a very odd way years ago i got to make a movie and i worked with my idol peter falk do you remember peter falk colombo when i was a kid i didnt care about acting comedians my idols were all comedians i never cared about acting but when i was like eight years old i saw peter falk in a movie i said whats this guy doing i love this guy so years went by and i said i want to work with him i wrote a movie where he played my father and we got to be friends and so one day were talking about comedy and i said well so what do you like what kind of comedies do you like so peter falk says well you know uh to be honest a lot of the things that make me laugh they dont make other people laugh i said well try me id be curious so he tells me this story which im gonna share with you and i thought it was funny i thought it was a very funny story but over the years i thought about it i said its more than funny this story has hidden inside it the secret of life heres the story so peter goes to lunch at a deli a new yorkstyle deli all right waiter old school waiter but waiting tables years seen it all nothing fazes him he comes to the table and he says would anybody like dessert peter falk says do you have rice pudding the guy says yes peter goes hang on before you bring it does it have raisins the guy says no he says are you sure he says yeah he says youre positive because a lot of places they put raisins in their rice puddings and i cant eat raisins if it has a raisin i dont want it ill tell you right now if it has raisins i dont want it the waiter says mr falk i dont know how else to tell you no theres no raisins in the rice pudding peter falk says all right ill have it waiter goes to the kitchen brings out the rice pudding its a chockful of raisins just just covered top to bottom through the glass dark with raisins peter falk says hey i thought you said theres no raisins the waiter just shrugged and said here and there youll find a raisin and i said well thats what life is isnt it nothing is all good even the things you love have things in it you dont love but thats just the cost of doing business so thats what i wish for you nice people in the rice pudding of life deal with

              "  'is this your card youre still thinking about the dick pic yeah yeah dude this is the time of the night where a lot of comedians will start doing their antitrans material im happy to inform you i have no antitrans material i have nothing but love and respect for the trans community and also im always so frustrated when people frame it as how its inconvenient to them when someone transitions when they talk about how they have to learn a new name or a new pronoun or they have to change a contact in their email address folder and really if were being honest lets be honest for a second what would actually be harder for you if someone in your life decided they were transitioning to a new gender or if someone in your life decided that as of tomorrow they were going to be a vegan like what makes your life harder tomorrow because you guys five years ago my brother decided to be a vegan and ive spent multiple thanksgivings with him and i would prefer my next thanksgiving start with my dad walking in and saying im a lady now than i would spending another thanksgiving where my brother keeps asking me is there butter in this im like theres fucking butter in everything that is the true meaning of thanksgiving is butter in everything thats how the first thanksgiving started the indigenous people came over they were like this is maize and the pilgrims said what if we put butter on it and call it corn and the indigenous people were like oh my god this is so much better how can we ever repay you and the pilgrims were like we have an idea but were not gonna tell you yet white man my brother whos hardcore my brother will not eat honey my brother said that vegans who eat honey are called beegans i found out he didnt eat honey because one day he was over at my apartment and i just sort of threw a granola bar at him because he looked like he was starving and he picked it up and he just started reading the label if there was a logo for veganism it should be someone at your home reading a label found a problem by the way i wish i could be a vegan every argument for being a vegan is a good one its better for the environment its more humane the best argument though is this you guys my brother looks so much healthier than i do like if you saw a picture of my brother and i next to each other you would stop eating meat yesterday like he glows like the sun and next to him i look like a guy holding a lantern at the bow of a ferry im like the fog is thick but well make it through i mentioned my inlaws earlier and i want to give a special pay a little special attention to my wonderful motherinlaw i really do have the greatest motherinlaw in the world and my favorite thing about her is there are also times that she agrees with me that my wife is being a lot sometimes my wife and i will be fighting in front of my motherinlaw and she will just make eye contact with me from across the room as if to say sorry but it has to be nonverbal it is only of value to me if it is a nonverbal acknowledgment of my wifes behavior if she actually speaks up in my defense thats a disaster for me because every married person here knows that its always just easiest to agree with your spouse when theyre complaining about something and i cannot tell you how many times its been the end of the night and were getting ready for bed and my wife will say can you believe my mom says i have to be nicer to you and my only response is yeah what a bitch mind your own business lady i do have a mean wife you guys but only to me my wife is mean to me and she is so nice to the kids and that is so much better than the other way around if my wife was nice to me but mean to the kids my life would be a nightmare i would come home and theyd always run over and be like hey man you got to step in and do something were your kids too and id be like shh dont talk to me i dont want her to know were friends iby the way this is not an attack on my wife this is a defense of her meanness my wife works so hard she has three children she is so depleted she has a fulltime job my wife is a lawyer my wife passed the new york bar she is a brilliant woman the new york bar thats the hardest one thats the one giuliani passed so i get it she is tired all the time and shes so patient with her children and sometimes she has to take it out on me and also i deserve it you guys i am so irritating here are some of the things i do here are some of the things i do that earn her meanness were on our third kid i still dont know how to collapse the stroller no idea i look at a stroller the way a dog would if you told him to do origami i have no idea how to fold up the stroller ill just like wiggle it ill shake it a little bit hey quick question for the women here have you',\n",
